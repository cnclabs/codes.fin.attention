item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview pixtech was founded in june to develop and commercialize field emission displays 
since inception  we have been a development stage company and our operating activities related primarily to raising capital  conducting research and development activities  concluding cooperation and license agreements with certain displays manufacturers  including motorola  inc and futaba corporation  and establishing manufacturing capabilities for our field emission displays 
pursuant to a contract manufacturing agreement signed with unipac in may  and after the adaptation of unipac s plant  including addition of certain equipment and the transfer of our manufacturing processes  we are producing fully qualified displays at unipac 
while current shipments of field emission displays are still minimal  we expect to increase significantly the production volumes throughout the year however  we do not anticipate generating positive gross margins on our sales of products in year in march  we acquired certain assets of micron technology  inc relating to field emission displays including equipment and other tangible assets  certain contract rights and cash 
the accompanying financial statements reflect the acquisition of assets for a cost of  and the assumption of certain liabilities in the amount of  in consideration of the issuance of  shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock 
our revenues from have relied mainly on cooperation and license revenue from funding under grants from the french government and the european union 
also  in  we had significant revenue from the darpa contract 
page under a license agreement with the french atomic energy commission  we are obligated to make royalty payments on our product sales and to pass through a portion of royalties on sales of royalty bearing products by our sublicensees 
under an amendment to the laboratoire d electronique  de technologie et d instrumentation license agreement signed in  the royalty rates and minimum payments payable to french atomic energy commission were temporarily increased for a period of three years 
royalty amounts accrued under this agreement were year royalty amount see notes to consolidated financial statements note related party transactions 
all of our expenses to date  except royalties and pass through expenses payable to french atomic energy commission and tax expenses directly associated with revenues from cooperation and license agreements have been recorded as operating expenses  since we have not shipped enough products to determine a meaningful cost of products sold category 
we have incurred cumulative losses of million from inception to december  we have recorded operating losses every quarter since  and we expect to incur additional operating losses 
the magnitude and duration of our future losses will depend on a number of factors within and outside of our control  including the rate at which we can successfully manufacture and commercialize our field emission displays  if at all  and the related costs of such efforts 
successful commercialization of our displays will in turn depend on a number of factors  including the successful development of sufficient market demand for our products 
results of operations cooperation and license revenues we recognized revenues under cooperation and license agreements of million in and million in  we recognized no cooperation and license agreement revenues in the significant decrease in cooperation and license revenues in and over reflects the achievement at the end of of most of our contractual milestones 
the cooperation phase of these agreements  which had generated milestone revenues for us  expired in june in the future  we may derive royalty revenues only under existing cooperation and license agreements 
these royalty revenues will be based on licensees sales  if any  of royalty bearing products 
we may grant royalty bearing licenses to third parties to the field emission display technology cross licensed to us from our licensees  subject to certain restrictions 
royalties payable to us under these third party licenses would be shared with the existing licensees 
in  we entered into a cooperation agreement with a major japanese cathode ray tube manufacturer to demonstrate a inch field emission display 
revenues generated under this agreement in and were included in cooperation and license revenues 
in february  we entered into a subsequent cooperation agreement with our cathode ray tube partner 
we will not record any significant revenues under this agreement 
product sales we recognized product sales of  in   in and  in through  these product sales primarily represented the shipment of a few high priced field emission display displays and cathodes to customers for evaluation and product development purposes 
in  product revenues remained relatively constant compared to  and primarily reflected the shipment of displays to our first volume customer  zoll medical 
other revenues other revenues consist of funding under european development contracts  our darpa contract and other miscellaneous revenues 
other revenues were million in  million in and million in of these revenues   in and million in relate to a development contract granted in december from the french ministry of industry to support manufacturing of field emission displays 
there were no revenues under this contract in we successfully completed this development contract in and will not derive any additional revenue page from it 
we received million from darpa in in addition  we expect to earn development contract related revenues in  primarily following expected recognition as income of certain amounts which we collected before december   and previously recorded as deferred revenues see notes to consolidated financial statements note other and deferred revenues 
research and development expenses acquisition of intellectual property rights since inception  we have expensed million for the acquisition of intellectual property rights from our licensees and other third parties 
in  we expensed  in connection with a license agreement with coloray display corporation  a california corporation  providing us with a worldwide  non exclusive royalty free license on certain technologies related to field emission displays 
other research and development expenses these expenses include salaries and associated expenses for in house research and development activities conducted both in our pilot plant and our research and development facility in boise  idaho  the cost of staffing and operating our pilot manufacturing facility and the cost of supporting the transfer and adaptation of our field emission display technology to unipac  as well as obligations to commissariat a l energie atomique under the laboratoire d electronique  de technologie et d instrumentation research agreement  and miscellaneous contract consulting fees 
as part of the acquisition of micron display s assets in may  we hired employees to continue research and development work in the boise facility  thus reinforcing our field emission display technology development efforts 
in addition  the development team located in santa clara was moved to boise with an aim to focus our efforts on the expansion of the large display effort 
as a result  other research and development expenses increased from million in and million in to million in the increase primarily reflected the costs associated with the research and development activities conducted in boise following the micron transaction signed at the end of may and the cost of supporting the manufacturing start up at unipac 
sales and marketing expenses we incurred sales and marketing expenses of million in  million in and million in sales and marketing expenses may increase in the future  reflecting the expansion of our sales and marketing organization both in the united states and in europe  in order to achieve a successful commercialization phase for our products 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses amounted to million in  an increase of over general and administrative expenses incurred in  which amounted to million 
the increase primarily reflected the cost associated with the new facility in boise 
general and administrative expenses amounted to million in interest income expense  net interest income consists of interest on available and restricted cash 
interest expense consists of interest payable on long term obligations 
net interest expense was  in  compared to  in and  in  reflecting the increase in long term liabilities 
currency fluctuations although a significant portion of our revenues are denominated in us dollars  a substantial portion of our operating expenses are denominated in euros 
gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of assets and liabilities denominated in euros may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations  which are reported in us dollars 
most of our capital lease obligation is expressed in taiwanese dollars 
since  fluctuations of the parity of the taiwanese dollar versus the euro caused significant foreign exchange gains or losses 
we incurred net foreign exchange gains of  in and  in and net foreign exchange loss of  in we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future operating results 
to date  we have not yet undertaken hedging transactions to cover our currency exposure 
income tax we have recognized french income tax benefits of million since our inception  including  in   in and  in these income tax benefits represent tax credits for research and development activities we conducted in france and the benefit of net operating loss carry forward  net of valuation allowance 
as of december   we provided for a valuation allowance of million against a net deferred tax asset of million 
we will collect the tax credits for research and development in cash if we are not able to credit them against future income tax page liabilities within three fiscal years 
we collected  in for our income tax benefits  million in for our and income tax benefits and million in for our income tax benefits 
in the future  we may not record significant additional tax credit for research and development activities in france  as the benefit is based on increases in eligible research and development expenses in a given year over the two previous fiscal years 
as of december   our net operating loss carried forward in france were approximately million of which million will expire in  million in  million in  million in and million in if they are not utilized 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each quarter in and in the opinion of our management  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results set forth herein

through december   we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily from sales of million of equity securities and million of proceeds from borrowings and sale leaseback transactions 
in  we used million in cash and million in capital expenditures and investments to fund our operations 
this increase was caused by the increase in operating expenses associated with taiwan start up costs and with the funding of the operations in boise 
page as of december   we had commitments for capital expenditures of approximately  capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in capital expenditures exclude the assets acquired pursuant to the micron transaction as those assets were acquired for the issuance of our common stock 
capital expenditures also exclude assets acquired under capital lease obligations 
implementing volume production at unipac s manufacturing plant required significant capital expenditures 
under the foundry agreement with unipac  unipac acquired and funded million of capital expenditures for equipment only 
unipac leases a portion of that equipment to us  which amounted to million as of december  restricted cash amounted to million in and to million in restricted cash is related to the security interest that we granted to unipac pursuant to the foundry agreement  in relation to the purchase and funding by unipac of volume field emission displays production equipment 
the bank guaranty that we provided to unipac is expected to decrease to match the net amount of equipment leased by unipac to us 
both the amounts of this bank guaranty and the corresponding security interest to the banks are expected to continue decreasing in the future 
we have existing contracts with french authorities providing for the payment of grants totaling approximately million  which were fully paid to us as of december  in and january  we entered into two research and development agreements with french authorities 
under these agreements  we expect to benefit from zero interest loans totaling approximately million  of which we received million during  and of which we expect to receive million in in february  we entered into a research and development agreement with the european union and other european industrial companies 
the contribution of the european union to our costs under this agreement amounted to  over the period 
we received  in   in and  in from this contribution 
in november  we entered into a research and development agreement with french authorities 
under this agreement  we expect to benefit from a grant totaling approximately  of which we collected  in  and expect to collect  in since inception  we recognized french income tax benefits of million 
these income tax benefits represent tax credits for research and development activities conducted in france  which are paid in cash if we are not able to credit them against future income tax liabilities within three fiscal years 
in  we collected million  representing research and development tax credits recorded in and in april  we collected million from research and development tax credits recorded in on august   darpa awarded a development contract to us 
under the terms of the contract  we may receive approximately million to develop a color field emission display  of which we have already received million in we generated million in cash flows from financing activities in  as compared to million in these financing consisted primarily of sales of shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds us of million net of issuance costs 
cash flow generated from financing activities exclude non cash transactions related to i the issuance of  shares of our common stock to coloray display corporation with a value of  see notes to consolidated financial statements note stockholders equity and ii the dividends attached to the shares of convertible preferred stock in the amount of  see notes to consolidated financial statements note stockholders equity 
in consideration of the  shares of common stock and  warrants issued pursuant to the micron transaction  we received certain assets  assumed certain liabilities  and collected million in cash 
cash flows generated from financing activities in excluded non cash transactions related to the acquisition of these assets and the assumption of these liabilities  and resulted in net proceeds to pixtech of million net of issuance costs 
in addition  cash flows generated from financing activities included the sales of shares of common stock in a private placement in january  resulting in net proceeds of  on august   we entered into a private equity line agreement with kingsbridge capital ltd 
under the terms of the equity line agreement  we have the irrevocable right  subject to certain conditions to draw up to million cash in exchange page for common stock  in increments over a two year period 
we began to draw off the equity line agreement in  resulting in net proceeds of  on october   we completed a million equity private placement with unipac optoelectronics corporation 
under the term of this agreement  unipac received million shares of common stock 
long term liabilities increased by million in  representing two zero interest loans granted to pixtech by french local authorities 
of the repayments occurring in  million were related to the repayment of the million note granted to pixtech in by sumitomo corporation 
we believe that cash available december   which amounted to million  together with the anticipated proceeds during from research and development tax credits and from the various grants and loans described above will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the upcoming year 
we will require substantial funds to conduct research  development and testing  to develop and expand commercial scale manufacturing systems and to market any resulting products 
changes in technology or a growth of sales beyond levels we currently anticipate will also require further investment 
our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate at which we can develop our products  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch our products and attain a competitive position in the marketplace and the response of competitors to our products 
funds for these purposes  whether from equity or debt financing  or other sources  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
outlook issues and risks we are currently focused on the following activities  which we believe are necessary to the success of our business 
successfully implementing the manufacture of field emission displays by our taiwanese contract manufacturer  unipac  
improving our manufacturing processes and yields  both in our pilot plant and at unipac  
expanding our customer base and product offering  and  
continuing the development of our field emission display technology  including the development of large field emission displays 
you should carefully consider the following risks and issues  among others that are common among development stage companies such as ours 
it is especially important to keep these risk factors in mind when reading forward looking statements 
these are statements that relate to future periods and include discussions relating to market opportunities  acquisition opportunities  stock price and our ability to compete 
generally  the words anticipate  believe  expect  intend and similar expressions identify such forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements because of these and other factors 
we do not have any obligation to disclose if forward looking statements  or the circumstances they are based on  change 
we have a history of losses and accumulated deficit that may continue in the future 
we have a history of losses as follows loss to common operating net losses stockholders year ended december  million million year ended december  million million year ended december  million million the losses were due in part to limited revenues and to various expenditures  including expenditures associated with 
research and development activities  
pilot production activities  and page 
start up costs to improve volume manufacturing in taiwan  at unipac 
we expect to incur operating losses in the future due primarily to 
continuing research and development activities to develop field emission displays larger than inch in diagonal and color displays  
manufacturing start up costs in taiwan  and 
expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
as a result of these losses  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our ability to achieve and maintain profitability is highly dependent upon the successful commercialization of our monochrome and color displays 
we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to successfully commercialize our products or that we will ever achieve profitability 
we will need additional capital in the future 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations since inception  and have expended  and will need to expend  substantial funds to complete our planned technology and product development efforts  including 
continuous improvement of our manufacturing processes in order to achieve yields that will lead to an acceptable cost of products  
continuous product development activities in order to develop color displays that meet market requirements and to develop a range of products offered for sales  
continuous research and development activities in order to develop displays larger than inch in diagonal  and 
expansion of our marketing  sales and distribution activities 
in addition to the above requirements  we expect that we will require additional capital either in the form of debt or equity  regardless of whether and when we reach profitability  for the following activities 
working capital  
acquisition of manufacturing equipment to expand manufacturing capacity  and 
further product development 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds depend on numerous factors  including 
the rate of increase in manufacturing yields by unipac  in taiwan  
the magnitude  scope and results of our product development efforts  
the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  
competing technological and market developments  and 
expansion of strategic alliances for the development  manufacturing  sale  marketing and distribution of our products 
page due to the conversion of series e preferred stock  holders of common stock may face significant dilution 
in december  we issued  shares of series e stock  at a price of per share  to certain institutional investors 
the series e stock is generally convertible into our common stock at a rate equal to the lesser of a  and b the average closing price of our common stock over the ten trading day ending period ending on the day immediately preceding the day upon conversion 
when our common stock price falls below  the conversion of the series e stock may result in the issuance of a significant number of additional shares of common stock  and may cause significant dilution to current holders of our common stock 
even before the shares of series e stock are converted  the holders of the series e stock vote on the basis of the number of shares of common stock that the series e stock can be converted into 
therefore  a large drop in our stock price may result in a large amount of voting control being held by a small number of stockholders 
as of march st   there were  shares of series e stock outstanding that would have been convertible into  shares of our common stock  giving the holders of the series e stock of the vote of the issued and outstanding common stock 
holders of our series e preferred stock could engage in short selling to reduce their conversion price 
a decrease in the price of our common stock below the maximum conversion price could result in the series e preferred stock being convertible into more shares of common stock 
increased sales volume of our common stock could put downward pressure on the market price of the shares 
this fact could encourage holders of series e preferred stock to sell short our common stock prior to conversion of the series e preferred stock  thereby potentially causing the market price to decline 
the selling stockholders could then convert their series e preferred stock and use the share of common stock received upon conversion to cover their short position 
the selling stockholders could thereby profit by the decline in the market price of the common stock caused by their short selling 
if we fail to continue to meet nasdaq s listing maintenance requirement  nasdaq may delist our common stock 
there is a possibility that our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
while our common stock is currently quoted on the nasdaq national market  in order to remain quoted on the nasdaq national market  we must meet certain requirements with respect to 
market capitalization the market value of all outstanding shares of our common stock  
public float the number of outstanding shares of common stock held by those not affiliated with us  
market value of public float  
market price of the common stock  
number of market makers  
number of shareholders  and 
net tangible assets total assets minus total liabilities and intangible assets 
if the price of our common stock were to fall significantly below our current trading range  nasdaq may approach us regarding our continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
this situation could result from the rights contained in the series e stock  which is convertible into common stock at a conversion price based on a future price of our common stock 
if nasdaq were to begin delisting proceedings against us  it could reduce the level of liquidity currently available to our stockholders 
with regard to future priced securities such as our series e stock  nasdaq is concerned with the following  among other things 
disproportionate voting rights  
minimum bid price of a company s common stock  
public interest concerns  and 
change in control 
page the holders of our series e stock may vote their series e stock as if they were holders of common stock and are entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock that the series e stock is convertible into at the time of voting 
if our common stock price were to fall significantly  this right may be deemed to violate a nasdaq maintenance requirement due to the disproportionate voting right  when compared to our common stock  which each share of series e stock would have 
moreover  in order to continue to be listed on nasdaq  the minimum bid price of our common stock must stay above 
in addition to the fluctuations of the market in general and our common stock in particular  a decrease in our common stock price that causes the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series e stock to increase may exert downward pressure on the price of our common stock 
this may drive the minimum bid price of our common stock below  thus violating a nasdaq maintenance requirement 
on march st   the minimum bid price on our common stock was 
nasdaq has also stated that in egregious situations  future priced securities  such as our series e stock  may raise public interest concerns that may result in the delisting of our common stock  if nasdaq deems the delisting necessary to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  we could apply to have the common stock quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market 
the nasdaq smallcap market has a similar set of criteria for initial and continued quotation 
we may not  however  meet the requirements for initial or continued quotation on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if we were not able to meet the requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market  trading of our common stock could be conducted on an electronic bulletin board established for securities that do not meet the nasdaq smallcap market listing requirements  in what is commonly referred to as the pink sheets 
because the series e stock converts into a greater number of shares of our common stock as the market price declines  the issuance of the series e stock could be deemed by nasdaq to be both a change in control and a change in our financial structure 
if nasdaq were to make such a determination  we could be required to re apply for initial inclusion in the nasdaq national market 
the requirements for initial inclusion are greater than the requirements for continued listing and we may not be able to meet the higher standards 
in addition  if our common stock were delisted from the nasdaq national market  we may not have the right to obtain funds under the equity line agreement and it could be more difficult for us to obtain future financing 
in addition  if our common stock is delisted  investors interest in our common stock would be reduced  which would materially and adversely affect trading in  and the price of  our common stock 
because we use a single contract manufacturer to manufacture our field emission displays we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of products and we may have less control of price 
unipac  a liquid crystal display manufacturer and an affiliate of united microelectronics corporation  is our only contract manufacturer 
in the future  we expect that the products that will be manufactured at unipac and sold to our customers will represent the majority of our revenues 
if we are not able to implement our manufacturing plans with unipac as soon as we expect  we will not be able to ship medium to large volumes of field emission display products 
moreover  we will have less control over the price of the finished products  the timeliness of their delivery and their reliability and quality 
finally  we will not be able to obtain an acceptable cost for our field emission displays through high volume manufacturing  as compared to manufacturing field emission displays at our pilot production facility 
this situation would materially adversely affect our revenues and costs of producing products 
expectations about the final timing of this manufacturing plan with unipac are forward looking statements that still involve risks and uncertainties  including the ease or difficulty of the transfer of the field emission display technology to unipac 
our failure to adequately manage this contract manufacturing relationship or any delays in the shipment of our products would adversely affect us 
our manufacturing processes are still under development and we still need to obtain commercially acceptable yields and acceptable costs of products or our costs to produce our displays will be too high for us to be profitable 
page in order for us to succeed  we must continue to develop and produce a range of products incorporating our field emission display technology 
at this time  we have successfully developed only one monochrome field emission display product that has been incorporated into a commercial end user application and that is being targeted at various markets 
we will need to complete the development of additional field emission display products to enlarge our market opportunity  and there is no guaranty that we will succeed in these development efforts 
if we do not develop these new products  we will need to rely on sales of a single product to be successful 
we have used our manufacturing facility in montpellier  france to develop manufacturing processes but it has produced only a limited number of products suitable for sale 
additionally  to date  we have not completed testing of our manufacturing processes at unipac 
in order for us to be successful  we must improve our manufacturing yields in order to demonstrate the low cost potential of our field emission display technology 
even if we succeed in completing the development and testing of our manufacturing processes  we can not be sure that the favorable characteristics demonstrated by our current displays manufactured at our pilot manufacturing facility will be reproduced on a cost effective basis in commercial production 
we have  at this time  encountered a number of delays in the development of our products and processes  and it is possible that further delays will occur 
any significant delays could cause us to miss certain market opportunities and could reduce our product sales 
we need to further enhance our display performance of our color displays or our displays may never be accepted by a large number of potential customers 
we may never improve the performance characteristics of our color displays to a level that is commercially acceptable or we may fail to do so on a timely basis 
neither of which could result in potential customers not buying our products 
key elements of display performance are brightness  power efficiency and stability over time lifetime and reliability 
we are seeking to balance brightness with power efficiency to produce bright and low power consumption displays 
display reliability depends on a large number of factors  including the manufacturing process used in assembling the displays as well as the characteristics of the materials  including phosphors  used in the display 
in order to produce color displays that will provide the product life and other characteristics necessary for most applications  we need to make further advances in our manufacturing processes and in the selection of the materials we use 
we may never be able to fund the research and development activities needed to develop large displays 
we need to conduct a significant research and development effort in order to bring our current inch field emission display prototype to a stage where it can be manufactured in volume at an acceptable cost 
we may never be able to fund that effort 
even if we were able to develop a product that could be manufactured  we would have to locate or build a manufacturing facility to produce our displays 
currently  unipac has a facility and equipment to build small displays only 
we may not be able to fund the amount needed in order to acquire or build a manufacturing facility for our large displays 
if we are unable to develop or manufacture large displays  we will miss large market opportunities for flat panel displays 
we face intense competition and need to compete with current and future competing technologies that may outperform our displays thus making our display undesirable 
our competitors may succeed in developing products that outperform our displays or that are more cost effective 
if our competitors develop products that offer significant advantages over our products and we are unable to improve our technology  or develop or acquire alternative technology that is more competitive  we may not be able to sell our displays 
products utilizing liquid crystal display technology currently dominate the market for flat panel display products 
certain liquid crystal display manufacturers  such as canon  sharp  nec  hitachi  samsung and toshiba have substantially greater name recognition and financial  technological  marketing and other resources than us 
presently liquid crystal displays are in short demand and independent forecasts predict that this may continue over a certain period of time 
however  liquid crystal display manufacturers have made  and continue to make  substantial investments in increasing capacity as well as product performance 
we believe that  over time  this  combined with new competitors entering the flat panel displays market  may page cause over supply conditions and may have the effect of reducing average selling prices of flat panel displays 
to effectively compete  we could be required to increase the performance of our products or reduce prices 
in the event of price reductions  we will not be able to maintain gross margins unless we reduce our cost of sales 
there are a number of domestic and international companies developing and marketing display devices using alternative technologies to liquid crystal display technology  such as vacuum fluorescent displays  electro luminescent panels and plasma panels 
additionally  some of the basic field emission display technology is in the public domain and  as a result  we have a number of potential direct competitors developing field emission displays or developing fundamental field emission displays technology 
these companies  including canon  futaba  motorola  sony  fujitsu  samsung and toshiba  as well as smaller companies  including candescent  and silicon diamond technology 
although we own the rights to significant technological advances in field emission display technology  potential competitors may have developed or may soon develop comparable or superior field emission display technology 
many of the developers of alternative flat panel display and competing field emission display technologies have substantially greater name recognition and financial  research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources than us  and have made and continue to make substantial investments in improving their technologies and manufacturing processes 
because potential customers may not accept our products we may never sell the number of displays required to make our business profitable 
we are uncertain about the potential size and timing of our target market opportunities 
we anticipate marketing our displays to original equipment manufacturer customers  which are customers that will incorporate our product into their final product 
it is possible that demand for any particular product by these customers will not last or that new markets will fail to develop as we expect  or at all 
our ability to have consumer products sold that incorporate our displays will depend  in part  on the following factors 
whether original equipment manufacturers select our products for incorporation into their products  
the successful introduction of such products by the original equipment manufacturers  and 
the successful commercialization of products developed by parties incorporating our products 
it takes a long time for any product to achieve market success  and any success is never certain 
the introduction of new products is often delayed by the need to have the products selected by an original equipment manufacturer and designed into the original equipment manufacturer s products 
for certain products  the delay attributable to a manufacturer s design cycle may be a year or longer 
factors affecting the length of these delays include 
the size of the manufacturer  
the type of application  and 
whether the displays are being designed into new products or fitted into existing applications 
if volume production of such products is delayed for any reason  our competitors may introduce new technologies or refine existing technologies that could diminish the commercial acceptance of our products 
we have limited sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
we have limited internal sales  marketing and distribution experience and capabilities 
until recently  we were a development stage company with no products or product sales 
consequently  we had not established significant sales  marketing  or distribution operations within our company 
recently  however  we have begun sales of our displays to customers 
we will not be able to develop significant revenues from the sales of our products unless we can attract and retain highly qualified employees to market and oversee the distribution of our products 
if we are unable to establish and maintain significant sales  marketing and distribution efforts  either internally or through arrangements with third parties  we may be adversely affected 
we may have difficulty protecting patents and other proprietary rights to our technology and may therefore be unable to prevent competitors from using our technology 
page we have been granted  have filed applications for  and have been licensed under a number of patents in the united states and other countries 
we rely on these patents and licenses for an advantage in our industry and any infringement of these patents and licenses will lessen our advantage 
however  rights granted under patents may not provide us with any competitive advantage over competitors with similar technology  and any issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect against these competitors 
we have not conducted an independent review of patents issued to other companies 
we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on such inventions because patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue and the publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 
competitors in both the united states and other countries may have applied for or obtained  or may in the future apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make and sell our products 
we also rely on unpatented  proprietary technology  which is significant to the development and manufacture of our displays 
others may independently develop the same or similar technology or obtain access to our unpatented technology 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies  our competitors may develop products using our technology 
moreover  claims that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others are more likely to be asserted after we begin commercial sales of products using our technology 
it is possible that competitors will infringe our patents 
even the successful defense and prosecution of patent suits is costly and time consuming 
the adverse outcome of a patent suit could subject us to significant liabilities to other parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to stop selling our products 
we have received correspondence from futaba corporation and its legal counsel beginning in february alleging the following 
we are infringing one or more patents owned by futaba relating to the construction and manufacture of our displays that are not expressly included under the license agreement between us and futaba  
our use of terms such as alliance and partners in describing the nature of our contractual relationships with motorola  raytheon and futaba in reports filed with the sec is misleading  and 
certain provisions in our agreement with unipac constitute an impermissible sublicense of futaba technology 
futaba has also claimed that we improperly supplied certain futaba proprietary information to unipac  and that unipac has  in turn  disclosed such information to a third party vendor
