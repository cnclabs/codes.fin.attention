the following table breaks out trimble s revenues by industry segment december  total january  total january  total revenue revenue revenue in thousands precision positioning group    mobile and timing technologies    total revenue    precision positioning group the precision positioning group revenues decreased by in fiscal over fiscal the revenue decrease compared to is due to the following o sales were impacted from the change in commission structure for some of our products from commission dealers to buy sell dealers in fiscal under the buy sell arrangement  the product is discounted to the dealer  as opposed to end user pricing with commissions recorded under sales and marketing expense 
o sales to original equipment manufacturers such as cnh global and caterpillar decreased as compared to sales due to an economic slowdown in the united states for mining and agriculture related products 
o in the fourth quarter of  delivery problems due to critical part shortages in our supply chain  and transitional issues with outsourcing our manufacturing  had a negative impact on revenue for the fiscal year ended precision positioning group revenues had a growth rate of in fiscal over fiscal the increase compared to was primarily due to increases in revenues in the land surveying  marine surveying  mapping  and gis systems  and mining  construction  and agriculture markets 
the increase in land surveying was due to the continued strong customer acceptance of trimble s gps total station and products 
also  the increase in marine survey  mapping  and gis  as well as mining  construction and agriculture reflects increased demand for these products 
mobile and timing technologies mobile and timing technologies revenues increased in fiscal over fiscal the increase is attributable to strong growth in our automotive and timing markets which was partially offset by decreases in commercial marine  commercial air transport  and military systems  due to the following o trimble decided to exit the commercial marine business in the fourth quarter of and sold the last of such products in the second quarter of o commercial air transport was down  due to decreases in market demand and the successful conclusion of shipments in fiscal to american airlines and continental airlines through our honeywell alliance  which were not repeated in fiscal o military systems declined due to the completion of our cugr contract in the first quarter of which sales were not repeated in the mobile and timing technologies revenues decreased in fiscal from fiscal the decrease was primarily in automotive  commercial air transport and military aerospace systems 
the softness in the automotive market was due to the financial difficulties of a major customer and a delay in our new product introductions 
the commercial air transport decrease was due to less than anticipated demand from honeywell  and the military aerospace system decrease was due to the large dollar shipment on the cugr contract in the fourth quarter of  which was not repeated in in addition  mobile and timing technologies revenues in  included million in revenues from a development agreement in connection with an irrevocable nonrefundable  nonrecurring engineering fee and a nonrecurring one time million technology license from pioneer electronic corporation in connection with expansion of its prior license for in car navigation 
military sales are highly dependent on contracts that are subject to government approval and are  therefore  expected to continue to fluctuate from period to period 
trimble believes that opportunities in this market have been substantially reduced by cutbacks in us and foreign military spending 
export sales export sales from domestic operations  as a percentage of total revenue  were in  in  and in sales to unaffiliated customers in foreign locations  as a percentage of total revenue  were in  and in both and trimble anticipates that export revenue and sales made by its subsidiaries in locations outside the us will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenue 
for this reason  trimble is subject to the risks inherent in these sales  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  governmental approval  and tariffs or other barriers 
even though the us government announced on march   that it would support and maintain the gps system  as well as eliminate the use of selective availability sa a method of degrading gps accuracy there may be a reluctance in certain foreign markets to purchase products based on gps technology  given the control of gps by the us government 
trimble s results of operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue to generate significant sales in locations outside the us no single customer  including the us government and its agencies  accounted for or more of trimble s total revenues in fiscal  or it is possible  however  that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by the company may adversely affect the results of operations 
gross margin 
gross margin varies due to a number of factors  including product mix  domestic versus international sales  customer type  the effects of production volumes and fixed manufacturing costs on unit product costs  and new product start up costs 
in fiscal  the gross margin percentage on product sales was  compared with in and in the increase in gross margin percentages primarily reflect improved manufacturing cost controls achieved through the consolidation of the manufacturing organization  resulting in improved efficiencies and reduced inventory 
in addition  gross margins in the second half of fiscal were favorably impacted by the cost benefits of outsourcing our manufacturing to solectron 
the margins were enhanced by the positive impact of nonproduct revenues of million recognized from pioneer electronic corporation and from a development agreement in connection with an irrevocable  nonrefundable  nonrecurring engineering fee of million  however  there can be no assurance that similar items will recur in the future 
in addition  because of product mix changes within and among the industry markets  market pressures on unit selling prices  fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs  and other factors  positive future gross margins cannot be assured 
trimble expects that in the future a higher percentage of its business will be conducted through alliances with strategic partners 
as a result of volume pricing and the assumption of certain operating costs by the partner  margins on this business are likely to be lower than sales directly to end users 
operating expenses 
the following table shows operating expenses for the periods indicated 
it should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below fiscal years ended december  january  january  in thousands research and development    sales and marketing    general and administrative    restructuring charges  total    research and development 
research and development spending decreased in absolute dollars during fiscal  representing of revenues as compared with in and in the lower research and development expenses in are due primarily to trimble s receiving approximately million more funds from cost reimbursement projects in as compared to also  there were decreases in our expenses of approximately million related to electronic parts  depreciation  travel  personnel  and other supplies as part of the company s restructuring plans which were implemented in the last half of fiscal the dollar increase from to is due primarily to trimble s receiving approximately million fewer funds from cost reimbursement projects in as compared with trimble plans to continue its aggressive development of future products 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased during fiscal  representing of revenues  as compared with in and in the primary reason for the dollar and percentage decrease in expenses from to is decreases of approximately million in personnel  consultants  travel  advertising  trade shows  expensed demo equipment  and other office supplies as part of the company s restructuring plan  which was implemented in the last half of fiscal in addition  sales commissions were lower as a percentage of sales  due to the change in dealer structure for some of our product lines from commission dealers to buy sell 
the primary reason for the dollar and percentage increases in expenses from to was an increase of approximately million in personnel and related expenses that accompany an increase in the number of employees 
in addition  trimble experienced increases in expenses of approximately million related to trade shows  advertising  and demo equipment expenses 
trimble s future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which we currently compete  and on our ability to continue to identify and exploit new markets for our products 
in addition  we have encountered significant competition in selected markets  and we expect such competition to intensify as the market for gps applications receives acceptance 
several of trimble s competitors are major corporations with substantially greater financial  technical  and marketing resources 
increased competition may result in reduced market share and is likely to result in price reductions of gps based products  which could adversely affect trimble s revenues and profitability 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars during fiscal  representing of revenues  as compared with in and in the increase in fiscal as compared to is due to an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to customers in south america for  and an increase in building rental costs due to the renewal of many of our building leases 
this increase was partially offset by space consolidations as part of our restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter of the increase from to was due primarily to an increase of approximately million in personnel and the related expenses that accompany an increase in the number of employees and consultants  as well as an increase of approximately million in outside services related to legal fees associated with certain litigation matters during restructuring charges 
as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements during the year ended january   trimble recorded a restructuring charge of million classified in operating expenses 
these charges were a result of trimble s reorganization to improve business processes and to decrease organizational redundancies  to improve management accountability and to improve our focus on profitable operations 
as a result of the reorganization  trimble downsized its operations  including reducing headcount and facilities space usage  and canceled its enterprisewide information system project and certain research and development projects 
the impact of these decisions was that significant amounts of our fixed assets  prepaid expenses  and purchased technology had been impaired and certain liabilities incurred 
trimble wrote down the related assets to their net realizable values and made provisions for the estimated liabilities 
the elements of the charges incurred in fiscal and the amounts remaining at december   on the balance sheet are as follows in thousands total charged to amounts paid amounts paid remaining in expense in written off written off accrued liabilites fiscal in fiscal in fiscal as of december  employee termination benefits    facility space reductions   erp system abandonment    subtotal     the cash expenditures associated with the remaining obligations will occur primarily in fiscal nonoperating income expense  net 
nonoperating income expense  net  includes interest income and expense  as well as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
foreign exchange gains were  in fiscal  compared with gains of  in and trimble s policy is to hedge its exposure to foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on consolidated results of operations 
gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward contracts offset gains and losses resulting from the underlying hedged transactions 
interest income increased in from and decreased in from the higher interest income in is due primarily to the increased interest income received on cash and short term investments because of higher average balance for fiscal over fiscal the decrease in from was because of lower interest income received on cash and short term investments due to lower average balances for the year  over the prior year 
interest expense decreased slightly in due to lower fees in foreign locations 
interest expense includes interest on a million note issued in august  and fees on unused lines of credit 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for details of long term debt and lines of credit 
income tax provision 
trimble s effective tax rates from continuing operations for fiscal years  and are   and  respectively 
the and income tax rates are less than the federal statutory rate of  due primarily to the realization of the benefits from prior net operating losses and previously reserved deferred tax assets 
the income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate  due primarily to foreign taxes and the inability to realize the benefit of net operating losses 
inflation 
the effects of inflation on trimble s financial results have not been significant to date 
litigation trimble is involved in a number of legal matters as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while trimble does not expect to suffer significant adverse effects from these litigation matters or from unasserted claims  the nature of litigation is unpredictable and there can be no assurance that it will not do so 
liquidity and capital resources at december   trimble had cash and cash equivalents of million and million in short term investments 
trimble s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased from the prior year  due to an increase in net income and the receipt of million in cash as part of an agreement with solectron for the outsourcing of trimble s manufacturing operations located in sunnyvale  california see note to the consolidated financial statements 
trimble s long term debt consisted primarily of a million note obligation due in we had no debt outstanding under our  unsecured line of credit but had issued certain letters of credit as of december   amounting to approximately  trimble has relied primarily on cash provided by operating and financing activities and net sales of short term investments to fund capital expenditures  the repurchase of the company s common stock  and other investing activities 
management believes that its cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances  together with its existing credit line  will be sufficient to meet its anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
in fiscal  the cash provided by operating activities was million  as compared to cash provided of million in the corresponding period in cash provided by operating activities in arose from the company s net income  plus depreciation and amortization and decreases in inventories and offset partially by increases in accounts receivable and decreases in accrued liabilities 
inventory from continuing operations as of december  decreased by million from the year end levels primarily  due to the transition of certain manufacturing operations to solectron as well as a focused effort by trimble to reduce inventory by supply chain synchronization  reducing lead and cycle times  simplifying product lines  and implementing tighter control over its material forecasting process see note to the consolidated financial statements 
trimble s ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in a large part on revenues  the rate of collections of accounts receivable  and the successful management of the solectron manufacturing relationship 
cash provided by sales of common stock in represents the proceeds from purchases made by employees pursuant to trimble s stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan  and totaled million for the year ended december  in august  trimble entered into a three year   unsecured revolving credit facility with four banks the credit agreement 
the credit agreement enables trimble to borrow up to  provided that certain financial and other covenants are met 
as of october   trimble  the agent  and the lenders agreed to change and amend certain covenants for the life of the loan  which expires in august of the  revolving credit facility was modified to include trimble s prior separate  line of credit and to simplify the entire arrangement 
the credit agreement provides for payment of a commitment fee of and borrowings to bear interest at over libor if the total funded debt to ebitda is less than or equal to times  and borrowings to bear interest at over libor if the ratio is greater than times and less than or equal to times  or  and borrowings to bear interest at over libor if the ratio is greater than times 
in addition to borrowing at the specified libor rate  trimble has the right to borrow with interest at the higher of i one of the bank s annual prime rate and ii the federal funds rate plus 
to date  trimble has not made any borrowings under the  unsecured revolving credit facility  but has issued certain letters of credit as of december   amounting to approximately  in addition  trimble is restricted from paying dividends under the terms of the credit agreement 
in june  trimble issued million of subordinated promissory notes bearing interest at an annual rate of  with principal due on june  interest payments are due monthly in arrears 
the notes are subordinated to the company s senior debt  which is defined as all pre existing indebtedness for borrowed money and certain future indebtedness for borrowed money including  subject to certain restrictions  secured bank borrowings and borrowed money for the acquisition of property and capital equipment and trade debt incurred in the ordinary course of business 
if trimble prepays any portion of the principal  it is required to pay additional amounts if us treasury obligations of a similar maturity exceed a specified yield 
under the agreement  trimble is also restricted from paying dividends 
the issuance of the subordinated promissory notes also included the issuance of warrants entitling holders to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of per share at any time through june  the net proceeds of the notes were  the notes are recorded as noncurrent liabilities  net of appraised fair value attributed to the warrants 
the value of the warrants and the issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense  using the interest rate method over the term of the subordinated promissory notes 
the effective annual interest rate on the notes is 
under the terms of the note  trimble is required to meet a minimum consolidated net worth requirement 
if trimble falls below the minimum consolidated net worth requirement we could be in default of our loan covenants 
such events could have a material adverse effect on trimble s operations and liquidity 
trimble announced in february that it had approved a discretionary program whereby up to  shares of its common stock could be repurchased on the open market by the company to offset the potential dilutive effects to earnings loss per share from the issuance of additional stock options 
in  trimble approved the repurchase of an additional million shares under the discretionary program 
during  trimble purchased  shares at a cost of million 
during  trimble purchased million shares at a cost of million 
during fiscal  no shares were repurchased under the discretionary program 
trimble presently expects capital expenditures in fiscal to be approximately million  primarily for computer equipment  software  and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion 
trimble is continually evaluating potential external investments in technologies related to its business and  to date  has made relatively small strategic investments in a number of gps related technology companies 
there can be no assurance that any such outside investments made to date nor any potential future investments will be successful 
trimble has evaluated the issues raised by the introduction of the single european currency euro for initial implementation as of january   and during the transition period through january  trimble does not currently believe that the introduction of the euro will have a material effect on its foreign exchange and hedging activities 
trimble has also assessed the potential impact the euro conversion will have in regard to its internal systems accommodating euro denominated transactions 
trimble will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro introduction over time  based on currently available information 
trimble does not currently anticipate any adverse impact of the euro conversion on the company 
year impact year issues computers and software  as well as other equipment that relied on only two digits to identify or represent a year may be unable to accurately process or display certain information at or after the year this is commonly referred to as the year issue 
trimble is not aware of any year issues that have affected its business 
in preparation for the year  we incurred internal staff costs as well as consulting and other expenses 
the year expenses for external services totaled less than million 
during  trimble updated a significant portion of its computer software to be year compliant 
trimble is also not aware of any material problems with customers or suppliers 
accordingly  trimble does not anticipate incurring material expenses or experiencing any material operational disruption as a result of any year issues 
certain other risk factors trimble s revenues have historically tended to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to the timing of shipments of products under contracts and the sale of licensing rights 
a significant portion of trimble s quarterly revenues occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of a quarter 
if orders are not received  or if shipments were to be delayed a few days at the end of a quarter  the operating results and reported earnings per share for that quarter could be significantly impacted 
future revenues are difficult to predict  and projections are based primarily on historical models  which are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 
due to competitive pressure  prices of certain of trimble s products have declined substantially since their introduction  and increased competition is likely to result in further price reduction and loss of market share  which could adversely affect our net revenue 
with the selection of solectron as an exclusive manufacturing partner  trimble is substantially dependent upon a sole supplier for the manufacture of its precision positioning and mobile and timing technologies products 
in addition  we rely on sole suppliers for a number of our critical asics 
the dependence upon these sole suppliers subjects trimble to risks associated with an interruption of supply if we are not able to find alternative sources on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance that any delay  disruptions  or quality problems resulting from the use of a sole supplier will not have a material adverse effect on trimble s business and results of operations 
trimble s stock price is subject to significant volatility 
if revenues and or earnings fail to meet the expectations of the investment community  there could be an immediate and significant impact on the trading price of trimble s stock 
additionally  certain macro economic factors such as changes in interest rates could also have an impact on the trading price of trimble stock 
the value of trimble s products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings 
trimble recognizes that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents  it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market  take a license from such patent holders  or redesign our products 
trimble does not believe any of its products currently infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  but we cannot be certain they do not do so 
in addition  the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations 
such events could have a material adverse effect on trimble s revenues or profitability 
see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
trimble s future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products to market on a timely basis 
in some of our markets for example  land survey and gis where we have a market leadership position  a delay in new product introductions could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
no assurance can be given that we will not incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products 
trimble is continuously evaluating alliances and external investments in technologies related to its business  and has already entered into certain strategic alliances and has made relatively small strategic investments in a number of gps related technology companies 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  or products and alliances and strategic investments entail numerous risks  including i the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale  or other value  ii diversion of management s attention  iii loss of key employees of acquired operations  and iv inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities 
any such problems could have a material adverse effect on trimble s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
no assurances can be given that we will not incur problems from current or future alliances  acquisitions  or investments 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will realize value from any such strategic alliances  acquisitions  or investments 
trimble currently enjoys strong relationships with a few key customers 
an increasing amount of our revenue is generated from large oems such as philips vdo  nortel  caterpillar  cnh global formerly case corporation  and others 
a reduction or loss of business with these customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that trimble will realize value from these relationships in the future 
the ability of trimble to maintain its competitive technological position will depend  in a large part  on its ability to attract  motivate  and retain highly qualified development and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified employees in our industry and location is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract  motivate and retain enough qualified employees necessary for the future continued development of our business and products 
trimble has certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold 
for example  faa certification is required for all aviation products 
also  trimble s products that use integrated radio communication technology require an end user to obtain licensing from the federal communications commission fcc for frequency band usage 
during the fourth quarter of  the fcc temporarily suspended the issuance of licenses for certain of our real time kinematic products because of interference with certain other users of similar radio frequencies 
an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or fcc s delays could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
trimble s gps technology is dependent on the use of radio frequency spectrum 
the assignment of spectrum is controlled by an international organization known as the international telecommunications union itu 
any itu reallocation of radio frequency spectrum  including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum  may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which would  in turn  cause a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  emissions from mobile satellite service and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas will require trimble to record all derivatives held on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
with respect to derivatives which are hedges  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings  or will be recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
in june of the financial accounting standards board delayed the effective date of implementation for one year  therefore  sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  trimble expects to adopt sfas as of the beginning of its fiscal year the effect of adopting the sfas is currently being evaluated  but is not expected to have a material adverse effect on trimble s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab summarizes certain areas of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
trimble is currently assessing the impact of sab  but does not expect that it will have a material adverse effect on trimble s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following is a discussion of trimble s exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
trimble uses certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
trimble does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
all financial instruments are used in accordance polices approved by trimble s board of directors 
market interest rate risk short term investments owned by the company 
as of december   trimble had short term investments of million 
these short term investments consisted of million of highly liquid investments  with original maturities at the date of purchase between three and twelve months and a million liquid investment with an original maturity at the date of purchase of months see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical percent increase in market interest rates from levels at december   would cause the fair value of these short term investments to decline by an immaterial amount 
because trimble has the ability to hold these investments until maturity  we would not expect the value of these investments to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income 
as of january   trimble had short term investments of million 
these short term investments consisted of highly liquid investments  with original maturities at the date of purchase between three and twelve months 
see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical percent increase in market interest rates from levels at january   would cause the fair value of these short term investments to decline by an immaterial amount 
because trimble has the ability to hold these investments until maturity  we would not expect the value of these investments to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income 
outstanding debt of the company 
as of december  and january   trimble had outstanding long term debt of approximately million of subordinated promissory notes at a fixed interest rate of percent 
the interest rate of this instrument is fixed 
a hypothetical percent decrease in the interest rates would not have a material impact on trimble 
increases in interest rates could  however  increase interest expense associated with future borrowings of trimble  if any 
we do not currently hedge against interest rate increases 
foreign currency exchange rate risk trimble hedges risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
trimble utilizes forward contracts to hedge trade and intercompany receivables and payables 
these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements  as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the hedge contracts 
all hedge instruments are marked to market through earnings every period 
trimble does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy 
all contracts have a maturity of less than one year  and we do not defer any gains and losses  as they are all accounted for through earnings every period 
the following table provides information about trimble s foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of december  foreign contract value fair value buy currency amount usd in usd currency sell in thousands in thousands in thousands yen buy  yen sell    nzd buy    euro sell    sterling buy    the following table provides information about trimble s foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of january  foreign contract value fair value buy currency amount usd in usd currency sell in thousands in thousands in thousands yen buy  yen sell    nzd buy    ecu sell    sterling buy   dem sell the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future 
furthermore  the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by trimble s management  should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time 
as a result  actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above
