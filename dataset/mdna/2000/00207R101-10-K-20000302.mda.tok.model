item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading supplier of materials  equipment and related services used worldwide in the manufacture of semiconductor devices 
we specifically target the front end semiconductor materials market 
this market includes the processes used to convert a bare silicon wafer into a fully functional wafer that contains many copies of a semiconductor device or chip 
our customers include most of the leading semiconductor manufacturers in the world 
we have organized our operations along two business segments atmi materials and atmi technologies 
atmi materials provides products that are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process and related packaging and delivery systems 
atmi technologies provides products that sense and environmentally control these materials while also providing specialized thin film deposition services to semiconductor device manufacturers 
atmi technologies also conducts our venture and government funded research and development activities 
we have entered into eight mergers since  each of which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
as a result  our consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the results of these merged companies 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated percentage of total revenues fiscal year ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative merger costs and related expenses total operating expenses operating income interest income expense  net other income  net income before income taxes and minority interest income taxes income before minority interest minority interest net income segment data during  we adopted fasb statement no 
disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we have two segments atmi materials and atmi technologies 
the reportable segments are each managed separately because they manufacture and distribute distinct products with different production processes 
we evaluate performance and allocate resources based on operating profit or loss  not including interest and other income or expense and income taxes 
the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements 
intercompany sales are not material among segments or operating divisions 
the following tables provide reported results for each of these segments year ended december  in thousands revenues atmi materials    atmi technologies    consolidated revenues    operating income atmi materials    atmi technologies    merger costs and related expenses    consolidated operating income 
   comparison of years ended december   and revenues 
our revenues increased to million in from million in  following a decrease of in from million in the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the semiconductor industry s recovery  particularly for consumable products  as seen by atmi materials growth in revenue 
atmi materials experienced significant gains related to our sds  now dispensing and packaging products and liquid materials product lines in as compared to atmi technologies revenues for increased from levels 
semiconductor manufacturing capacity expansion began to rebound in the middle of leading to improved sales of ecosys environmental and sensing products and epitronics thin film deposition services 
soft market conditions in  evidenced by a decline in semiconductor unit demand in the second and third quarters of and a significant reduction in semiconductor equipment spending during most of  were the primary causes for the revenue decline for both atmi materials and atmi technologies when comparing with the decline in semiconductor unit demand during slowed sales of many of atmi materials product offerings 
semiconductor manufacturing capacity expansion substantially declined during  which caused a decrease in ecosys and epitronics product sales 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in gross margin increased to in from in this increase was due principally to margin growth related to manufacturing efficiencies from increased sales and a shift in product mix towards sds  now dispensing and packaging systems and liquid materials product lines 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross margin decreased to in from in  primarily as a result of less efficient fixed cost absorption in connection with the decrease in revenues experienced in  particularly within the ecosys  epitronics and now product lines 
volume declines within the photoresist stripping product lines  driven by the softening semiconductor industry conditions  also contributed to the reduction in gross margins in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in increased efforts to expand sds technology beyond ion implant applications into cvd  etch and bulk gas delivery  and continued product development activities within atmi materials and the emosyn venture resulted in growth of the research and development efforts 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses decreased to in from in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in similar to the increase in  the increase was due to the development efforts to extend the sds technology beyond existing applications  as well as the development of new chemical mechanical polishing materials and increased research efforts to expand our sensing and monitoring product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in despite decreases in expenses associated with decreased administrative costs and cost savings resulting from the integration of recent business acquisitions  expenses incurred related to the organization of our taiwanese subsidiary and the commencement of our enterprise system software implementation caused selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in additionally  the expenses included million in severance for several former executives within atmi materials and atmi technologies 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses decreased to in from in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in executive compensation paid to members of management of certain acquired businesses delatech  acsi and telosense due to weaker operating performance  a reduction of administrative costs resulting from reductions in personnel and decreased commissions on lower product revenues 
merger costs and related expenses 
the operating results included merger and related costs of million  including million of professional fees and transactions costs related to our november acquisitions of mst and newform and million of investment banking  legal and accounting fees in connection with the investigation  analysis and may closing of the telosense  delatech and acsi transactions 
the merger related costs included a million reversal of previously accrued merger costs for prior acquisitions 
the acquisition of delatech also resulted in a million asset impairment charge during the second quarter of for inventory million and goodwill million associated with an existing environmental equipment product line which was determined to be impaired 
the operating results included merger related charges of million incurred in completing the now acquisition 
operating income 
operating income  including the recognition of merger related costs  increased in to million from million in which was a decrease from million in atmi materials operating income for increased to million from million in this increase reflected the gains made due to the improved market conditions within the industry and increased market share penetration during the significant revenue increase in combined with stronger margins and cost containment initiatives resulted in higher operating income within atmi materials 
atmi materials operating income  as a percentage of revenues  was and for and  respectively 
atmi technologies operating income improved to million in compared to a million loss in the profitability increase was attributable to the growth in both ecosys and epitronics revenues  the attendant product margin improvements and a favorable product mix shift along with an improvement in profitability of various contract programs 
investments in research and product development within emosyn and our other ventures are reflected in atmi technologies operating income 
atmi technologies operating income  as a percentage of revenues  was and in and  respectively 
atmi materials operating income declined to million in fiscal from million in the revenue decline in reduced gross margins within atmi materials and  combined with an increase in research and development spending  drove the operating income decline 
atmi materials operating income  as a percentage revenues  was in atmi technologies operating income declined to a loss of million in fiscal compared to operating income of million in these losses were attributable to the severe decline in sales of ecosys products  reduced epitronics operating results caused by revenue declines on a relatively fixed cost base and an increase in research and development efforts focused on our emosyn business and other new business ventures 
other income  net 
other income  net increased to approximately million in from million in the increase in related to a significant increase in interest income due to increased cash levels on hand throughout all of compared to only part of these increased cash levels resulted from a public offering that was completed at the beginning of the second quarter of increased interest rate levels in also resulted in increased interest income 
interest expense declined in due to lower levels of debt outstanding at december  compared to december  other income  net increased to million in from a net expense of million in as a direct result of the increased cash and marketable securities that resulted from our public offering in the first quarter of interest expense decreased to million in from million in  and decreased in from million in the decrease related to the retirement of a significant debt balance related to the delatech acquisition as well as final payments on several equipment leases within epitronics 
the decrease was due to a conversion of outstanding debt at acsi into equity in late and lower overall debt balances outstanding during  as capital lease lines were paid down and certain high interest rate debt was retired 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased to million in from million in income tax expense decreased to million in from million in our income tax expense related primarily to united states federal  state and foreign tax liabilities  which were partially offset by various foreign sales corporation benefits and research and development credits 
the effective tax rate was in line with statutory rates at 
while no tax benefit was taken for a significant amount of merger related costs in  benefit was recognized based on changes in estimates regarding the realizability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of certain acquired companies 
the effective tax rate of was higher than statutory rates because no tax benefit was taken for the million of merger costs related to the now acquisition  and no tax benefit was recognized for operating losses sustained by acsi in the significant effective tax rate of was due in part to the operating results including the million for merger costs related to the adcs and lawrence semiconductor acquisitions for which no tax benefit was taken 
minority interest 
minority interest represents the interest held by kc tech co  ltd 
in the operations of adcs korea  a south korean chusik hoesa  which is a joint venture established to manufacture  sell and distribute chemicals to the semiconductor and related industries in south korea 
net income excluding transaction related costs and other expenses 
over the last three years  we have used mergers and acquisitions to accelerate our growth and broaden our product lines 
as a result of this strategy  we have incurred expenses to consummate these transactions and merge these acquired businesses into existing operations 
excluding these merger costs and certain severance charges related to reorganizing the business pursuant to these acquisitions  net income from recurring operations would have been million  or per share assuming dilution in this represents a increase over million  or per share assuming dilution in on a comparable basis  net income from recurring operations was million  or per share assuming dilution 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our activities through cash from operations  the sale of equity  external research and development funding and various lease and debt instruments 
our working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  net cash provided by operations was approximately million during  resulting primarily from improvements in working capital  as compared to cash provided from operations of million during the cash flow from operations for related primarily to net income adjusted for non cash charges partially offset by the increase in working capital items  primarily accounts receivable 
in addition  the million of merger costs and related expenses in  reduced the cash generated from operations by approximately million  as million were non cash charges and approximately million remained unpaid at december  the improvement in working capital for was primarily caused by a decrease in other assets and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the million of merger costs and related expenses in the third quarter of  reduced the cash generated from operations by approximately million  as approximately million remained unpaid at december  net cash provided by operations in was approximately million 
additionally  the million of merger costs and related expenses in the fourth quarter of  reduced the cash generated from operations by approximately million  as approximately million remained unpaid at december  our investing activities included capital expenditures of million  million  and million in the years  and  respectively 
the expenditures were made primarily to support the growth experienced at several of our manufacturing facilities 
the expenditures primarily related to installation of additional manufacturing capacity in danbury  connecticut  san jose  california and our two texas facilities 
the expenditures included both the installation of sds manufacturing capacity in the danbury  connecticut facility and an increase in epitaxial capacity in epitronics arizona facilities 
among other investing activities  in we invested approximately million raised primarily from a public offering of our common stock into marketable securities for future working capital requirements and potential merger and acquisition activities 
in july  prior to our acquisition of mst  it used million to purchase four businesses 
in addition  we sold million in marketable securities in our financing activities included a march registered underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock 
of such shares  we sold  shares and certain of our stockholders sold  shares 
we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
at december   we financed a significant portion of our capital equipment purchases  particularly the silicon epitaxial capacity  through capital leases with about million of capital lease obligations outstanding 
during and  we made payments on capital leases of approximately million and million  respectively 
financial institutions also provided collateral based loans for other equipment purchases 
in  we made million of note payments and during  we made payments on notes of approximately million  with the most significant payment being the retirement of a mortgage on the mesa  arizona epitronics facility 
our now business has an industrial revenue bond arrangement outstanding in the amount of million  which was used for equipment and improvements at its manufacturing facility and corporate office 
at december   million of loans  bonds and financing remained outstanding 
our management believes that our debt service obligations can be adequately satisfied by cash flows from operations 
we believe that our existing cash balances  marketable securities  existing sources of liquidity and anticipated funds from operations will satisfy our projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least the end of however  we also believe the level of financing resources available to us is an important competitive factor in our industry and we may seek additional capital prior to the end of that period 
additionally  we consider  on a continuing basis  potential acquisitions of technologies and businesses complementary to our current business 
there are no present agreements with respect to any such acquisitions 
however  any such transactions may affect our future capital needs 
operations outside the united states for the years ended december   and  export sales outside the united states  including asia and europe  accounted for   and  respectively  of our revenues 
we anticipate that our sales outside the united states will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
the november acquisitions of mst and newform have increased our european operations 
in addition  we have a wholly owned subsidiary in taiwan where we sell and service several of our product lines 
we also have a wholly owned subsidiary in south korea that manufactures and markets environmental abatement equipment in south korea and a joint venture agreement with kc tech pursuant to which we have a interest in adcs korea  a south korean chusik hoesa  which manufactures  sells and distributes thin film materials to the semiconductor and related industries in south korea 
year compliance we formed an internal compliance team to evaluate our internal information technology infrastructure and application systems and other non it infrastructure systems to determine whether such systems would operate correctly with regard to the import  export and processing of date information  including correct handling of leap years  in connection with the change in the calendar year from to  and to evaluate the year issue with respect to the systems of third party partners and suppliers with which we have a material relationship 
we completed an inventory analysis and risk assessment 
as previously planned and budgeted  we upgraded our core it systems to incorporate additional desired features and functionality including year compliant operators 
we completed the necessary upgrades to make the recently acquired businesses year compliant by december  in connection with such upgrades  we expect that our core it systems are year compliant  and no significant issues have arisen to date from the calendar change to january we do not expect that any additional costs of addressing the year issue will have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations or cash flows 
we also completed a non it system inventory analysis and risk assessment 
as a result of the analysis  no remediation actions were required in order to be year compliant 
we believe the number of non it systems is relatively small and  therefore  do not expect that any additional costs of addressing the year issue for these systems will have a material adverse impact on our operations or our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we completed a third party inventory and risk assessment and verified material year compliance of these systems by december  we believe the number of material third party systems is relatively small 
however  until year compliance of all third party systems if ascertained  the risk to our operations and any additional costs relating to these systems is unknown 
we believe that any problems that might arise would involve third party systems rather than our internal systems 
we believe that majority of the risks associated with year non compliance have been averted as the calendar turned 
any further risk might be the partial shutdown of a supplier or strategic partner and its inability to provide supplies and services to us on a timely basis 
we developed a contingency plan addressing potential issues  ensuring that adequate levels of critical supplies used in our manufacturing processes were on hand at the end of we tested our products for year compliance and determined that all of our products currently available for sale have either successfully passed year compliance testing or are not subject to year compliance because such products do not import  export or process date information in any manner 
we incurred approximately  relating to inventory analysis and risk assessment of potential year difficulties 
the funds to cover the costs incurred were derived from general operations 
the costs primarily related to desktop compliance and standardization to year compliance 
these year expenditures were within our planned organizational budgets and included the costs of reviewing key operating systems 
no it systems projects were deferred because of problems associated with the year issue

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   our cash included money market securities and commercial paper 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of our sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results in the future 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our future operating results or cash flows
