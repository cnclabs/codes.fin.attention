item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview cytogen corporation cytogen or the company which includes the company and its subsidiaries is an established biopharmaceutical company with two principal lines of business  proteomics and oncology 
the company is extending its expertise in antibodies and molecular recognition to the development of new products and a proteomics driven drug discovery platform 
the company has established a pipeline of product candidates based upon its proprietary antibody and prostate specific membrane antigen  or psma  technologies 
cytogen is also developing a proprietary protein pathway database as a drug discovery and development tool for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
cytogen s cancer management franchise currently comprises three marketed fda approved products prostascint  used to image the extent and spread of prostate cancer  oncoscint cr ov  marketed as a diagnostic imaging agent for colorectal and ovarian cancer and quadramet  marketed for the relief of cancer related bone pain 
the company is extending its cancer pipeline by exploiting psma  which cytogen exclusively licensed from memorial sloan kettering cancer center 
psma is a unique antigen highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and in the neovasculature of a variety of other solid tumors  including breast  lung and colon 
the company is developing its psma technology as part of its approach to offering a full range of prostate cancer management products and services throughout the progression of the disease  including gene based immunotherapy vaccines  antibody delivered therapeutic compounds and novel assays for detection of primary prostate cancer 
cytogen also plans to apply its psma technology  including therapeutics and in vitro diagnostics  toward other types of cancer based upon the company s experience in prostate cancer 
the company s in vivo immunotherapeutic development program is being conducted in collaboration with progenics pharmaceuticals  inc proteomics is the study of the expression and interaction of proteins 
genomics is the study and identification of an organism s genetic makeup 
while genomics provides important information regarding genetic makeup  it does not directly provide information regarding protein functions or protein interactions 
however  genomics data can prove useful in proteomics research as a source of obtaining complete protein sequences of ligands the company has identified 
public availability of this genomic information allows for effective integration in the company s database of public and proprietary information 
the company recognized in its past research that the key to understanding or developing the means to intervene in diseases was primarily based on understanding protein interactions rather than only through the use or study of genomics 
the company undertook this approach on its own initiative and with its own funds 
cytogen s proteomics program  under development by its subsidiary  axcell biosciences corporation  is focused on the identification of protein interaction and signaling pathways within cells as relating to disease processes 
the company utilizes its proprietary proteomics technology to map selective protein protein interactions and to develop a database  called the inter functional proteomic database  or ifp database  which includes data relating to protein signaling pathways linked to a variety of other bioinformatic data 
the ifp database is designed to permit customers to integrate existing databases  both public and proprietary  with the company s proprietary data to create a virtual laboratory on the computer desktop of researchers involved in drug discovery 
the company believes this database has significant potential commercial value to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as a means of expediting drug target identification  validation  screen development and lead compound optimization faster and cheaper than with current methodologies 
these proprietary technologies are designed to provide a platform from which the company can quickly and cost effectively determine protein protein interactions and build pathways of intracellular signaling data 
the company s ifp database also offers a consolidated platform to enable statistical and mathematical modeling of complex protein pathways

the company expects to significantly increase the funding of axcell for the proteomics program in the operating requirement for axcell will be funded by cytogen s existing cash balance 
the capital requirement for axcell may be funded by a million line of credit agreement entered into in february between the company and finova capital corporation finova facility 
from time to time  until november  the company will draw on the finova facility each loan to finance the acquisition of computers and equipment 
each loan will have a fixed term of months at an interest rate equal to plus the index rate and will be collateralized by the newly purchased equipment 
the company s capital and operating requirements may change depending upon various factors  including i whether the company and its strategic partners achieve success in manufacturing  marketing and commercialization of its products  ii the amount of resources which the company devotes to clinical evaluations and the expansion of marketing and sales capabilities  iii results of clinical trials and research and development activities  and iv competitive and technological developments  in particular the company may expend funds for development of its proteomics and psma technologies 
the company s financial objectives are to meet its capital and operating requirements through revenues from existing products  license and research contracts  and control of spending 
to achieve its strategic objectives  the company may enter into research and development partnerships and acquire  in license and develop other technologies  products or services 
certain of these strategies may require payments by the company in either cash or stock in addition to the costs associated with developing and marketing a product or technology 
the company currently has no commitments or specific plans for acquisitions or strategic alliances 
however  the company believes that  if successful  such strategies may increase long term revenues 
there can be no assurance as to the success of such strategies or that resulting funds will be sufficient to meet cash requirements until product revenues are sufficient to cover operating expenses 
to fund these strategic and operating activities  the company may sell equity and debt securities as market conditions permit or enter into credit facilities 
the company has incurred negative cash flows from operations since its inception  and has expended  and expects to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to implement its planned product development efforts  including acquisition of products and complementary technologies  research and development  clinical studies and regulatory activities  and to further its marketing and sales programs 
the company expects that its existing capital resources as of december   together with the net proceeds of million from a sale of equity to berlex in february and decreased operating costs will be adequate to fund the company s operations through the year no assurance can be given that the company will not consume a significant amount of its available resources before that time 
in addition  the company expects that it will have additional requirements for debt or equity capital  irrespective of whether and when it reaches profitability  for further development of products  product and technology acquisition costs  and working capital 
the company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on numerous factors  including the successful commercialization of its products  the costs associated with the acquisition of complementary products and technologies  progress in its product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with clinical trials  progress with regulatory affairs activities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the expansion of strategic alliances for the sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution of its products 
to the extent that the currently available funds and revenues are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  the company will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
based on the company s historical ability to raise capital and current market conditions  the company believes other financing alternatives are available 
there can be no assurance that the financing commitments described above or other financial alternatives will be available when needed or at terms commercially acceptable to the company or that the company would have adequate authorized unissued shares available for issuance without stockholder approval 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  further scale back or eliminate certain aspects of its operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
if adequate funds are not available  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
year compliance the year problem describes the concern that certain computer applications  which use two digits rather than four to represent dates  will interpret the year as and malfunction on or after january  cytogen s internal systems 
the company s programs and systems did not fail or malfunction upon the arrival of january  the company internal systems were modified and replaced with fully compliant systems  prior to december  the company believes that it has achieved its goals regarding year compliance on all of its critical and non critical systems 
readiness of third parties 
the company worked with its processing banks  network providers and manufacturing partners to ascertain that their systems were year compliant 
risks associated with the year the company is not aware  at this time  of any year non compliance issues that were not addressed and repaired prior to december  recently enacted accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
the bulletin draws on existing accounting rules and provides specific guidance on how those accounting rules should be applied  and specifically addresses revenue recognition for non refundable technology access fees in the biotechnology industry 
sab is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is evaluating sab and the effect it may have on the company s financial position or results of operations
