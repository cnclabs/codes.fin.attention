besides providing electricity and natural gas distribution and electric transmission services  avista utilities is also responsible for electric generation and production  electric wholesale marketing  and electric commodity trading  primarily for the purpose of optimizing system resources 
wholesale marketing and trading activities are primarily within the western systems coordinating council wscc 
avista utilities owns and operates eight hydroelectric projects  a wood waste fueled generating station and two natural gas combustion turbine ct peaking units 
it also owns a and a share in two coal fired generating facilities and leases two additional gas ct peaking units 
with this diverse energy resource portfolio  avista utilities remains one of the nation s lowest cost producers and sellers of electric energy services 
see item properties generating plants for additional information 
avista utilities wholesale marketing and trading activities are a secondary  but very important  part of avista utilities overall business strategy 
since  avista utilities has entered into a number of long term power sales contracts that have increased its electric wholesale revenues  and it is continuing to pursue electric wholesale marketing business and energy trading opportunities 
wholesale marketing includes sales and purchases under long term contracts with one year and longer terms 
wholesale sales are affected by weather and streamflow conditions and may eventually be affected by the restructuring of the electric utility industry 
electric commodity trading includes short term sales and purchases  such as next hour  next day and monthly blocks of energy  primarily for the purpose of optimizing system resources 
see industry restructuring for additional information 
avista utilities competes in the electric wholesale market with other western utilities  federal marketing agencies and power marketers 
avista utilities participation in the electric wholesale market allows it to maintain presence in and knowledge of the market  resulting in maximum optimization of its resources 
the electric wholesale market has changed significantly over the last few years with respect to market participants  level of activity  variability of prices  and per unit margins 
these changes have contributed to the increased liquidity of the market  which in turn has increased transactional volumes in the market 
it is expected that competition in the wholesale power market will remain vigorous 
avista corp  through its avista energy subsidiary  also pursues energy trading activities  however  avista energy s activities are not subject to state and federal price regulation 
challenges facing avista utilities include cost management  evolving technologies  self generation and fuel switching by commercial and industrial customers  the costs of increasingly stringent environmental laws and the potential for stranded or non recoverable utility assets 
avista utilities believes it faces minimal risk for stranded utility assets resulting from deregulation due to its low cost generation portfolio 
in a deregulated environment  however  evolving technologies that provide alternate energy supplies could affect the market price of power  and certain generating assets could have capital and operating costs above the adjusted market price

avista corporation electric requirements avista utilities annual peak requirements  including long term and short term contractual obligations  were  mw 
this peak occurred on december   at which time the maximum capacity available from avista utilities generating facilities  including long term and short term purchases  was  mw 
the electric requirements include both retail distribution needs and wholesale short term and long term commitments  which limits the amount of excess capacity available to support its energy trading business and  therefore  results in the need to purchase power 
electric resources avista utilities diverse resource mix of hydroelectric projects  thermal generating facilities  and power purchases and exchanges  combined with strategic access to regional electric transmission systems  enables it to remain one of the nation s lowest cost producers and sellers of electric energy services 
at december   avista utilities total owned resources available were hydroelectric and thermal 
see avista utilities electric operating statistics on page for avista utilities energy resource statistics 
hydroelectric resources hydroelectric generation is avista utilities lowest cost source of electricity and the availability of hydroelectric generation has a significant effect on its total energy costs 
under average operating conditions  avista utilities meets about one third of its total energy requirements both retail and long term wholesale with its own hydroelectric generation and long term hydroelectric contracts 
the streamflows to company owned hydroelectric projects were  and of normal in  and  respectively 
total hydroelectric resources provide amw annually 
thermal resources avista utilities has an interest in each of two twin unit coal fired facilities a interest in the centralia power plant in western washington and a interest in units and of the colstrip generating project in southeastern montana 
avista utilities purchased portland general electric s interest in centralia in december  adding to its previous interest 
this additional interest in currently being held as non utility property until the outcome of the pending sale is determined 
in addition  avista utilities owns a wood waste fired facility known as the kettle falls generating station in northeastern washington and two natural gas fired cts  located in spokane  used for peaking needs 
avista utilities also operates and leases two natural gas fired cts in northern idaho  used for peaking needs 
total thermal resources provide amw annually 
centralia  which is operated by pacificorp  is supplied with coal under both a fuel supply agreement in effect through december and various spot market purchases 
in  and  centralia provided approximately  and  respectively  of avista utilities thermal generation 
in may  the owners of the centralia power plant announced an agreement to sell the plant to transalta  a canadian company 
regulatory approvals have been received from the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc and the idaho public utilities commission ipuc 
the company is reviewing the terms of these approvals to determine whether to agree to the sale 
avista utilities will require additional generating capacity if the sale is finalized 
if transalta becomes the new owner  it has agreed to replace avista utilities lost output for three years through a purchase agreement 
see environmental issues for additional information about the pending sale 
colstrip is supplied with fuel under coal supply and transportation agreements in effect through december from adjacent coal reserves 
the montana power company sold its interest in the colstrip generating project to pp l global  which is now the operator of colstrip 
in  and  colstrip provided approximately  and of avista utilities thermal generation  respectively 
kettle falls primary fuel is wood waste generated as a by product from forest industry operations within one hundred miles of the plant 
natural gas may be used as an alternate fuel 
a combination of long term contracts plus spot purchases provides the company the flexibility to meet expected future fuel requirements for the plant 
in  and  kettle falls provided approximately  and of avista utilities thermal generation  respectively 
the four cts are natural gas fired units  primarily used for peaking needs 
two cts have access to domestic and canadian natural gas supplied through pacific gas transmission pgt 
in  and  these four units provided approximately  and  respectively  of avista utilities thermal generation 
purchases  exchanges and sales in  avista utilities had various long term purchase contracts with non coincidental peak peak that does not occur during the same hour equating to mw  with an average remaining life of years 
additionally  long term hydroelectric purchase contracts of mw peak were available with an average remaining contract life of years 
avista utilities also enters into a significant number of short term sales and purchases with durations of up to one year 
energy purchases and exchanges for the years  and provided approximately avista corporation  and  respectively  of avista utilities total electric energy requirements  which reflects increased wholesale marketing and resource optimization trading activity 
under the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa  avista utilities is required to purchase generation from qualifying facilities  including small hydroelectric and cogeneration projects  at avoided cost rates adopted by the wutc and the ipuc 
avista utilities purchased approximately  mwh  or about of its total energy requirements  from these sources at a cost of approximately million in these contracts expire in hydroelectric relicensing avista utilities is a licensee under the federal power act  which regulates certain of its generation resources and is administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  and its licensed projects are subject to the provisions of part i of that act 
these provisions include payment for headwater benefits  condemnation of licensed projects upon payment of just compensation  and take over of such projects after the expiration of the license upon payment of the lesser of net investment or fair value of the project  in either case plus severance damages 
all but one of avista utilities hydroelectric plants are regulated by the ferc through project licenses issued for year periods 
see item properties avista utilities for additional information 
the cabinet gorge and noxon rapids plants received a new year operating license from the ferc on february  the existing licenses were combined into one license under the name clark fork projects 
the application to relicense cabinet gorge and noxon rapids was filed with the ferc on february   and included the clark fork settlement agreement signed by parties and a collaboratively written environmental assessment report 
the application culminated seven years of planning and consultation with native american tribes  special interest groups  resource agencies and the general public 
for hydroelectric projects of this size  it is unprecedented to have reached settlement two years before the license expired  while preserving the projects economic peaking and load following operations 
the collaborative process used by avista utilities is nationally recognized as the model for the ferc s alternative approach to relicensing 
as part of the settlement agreement  avista utilities committed to early implementation of protection  mitigation and enhancement measures beginning in march measures in the agreement  which will cost approximately million annually  address issues related to fisheries  water quality  wildlife  recreation  land use  cultural resources and erosion 
see item properties avista utilities and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future outlook for additional information 
the issue of high dissolved gas levels downstream of cabinet gorge during spill periods continues to be studied  as agreed to in the settlement agreement 
to date  intensive biological studies in the lower clark fork river and lake pend oreille have documented minimal biological effects of high dissolved gas levels on free ranging fish 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  avista utilities will develop an abatement and or mitigation strategy by avista utilities operates six hydroelectric plants on the spokane river  and five of these long lake  nine mile  upper falls  monroe street and post falls are under one ferc license 
little falls is not licensed by the ferc 
the license for the spokane river projects expires in august  and avista utilities will be required to file a notice of intent to relicense prior to august planning and information gathering activities are currently underway 
natural gas operations natural gas remains competitively priced compared to alternative fuel sources for residential  commercial and industrial customers 
because of abundant supplies and competitive markets  natural gas should sustain its market advantage 
avista utilities continues to advise residential and commercial electric customers about the cost advantages of converting space and water heating needs to natural gas 
significant growth has occurred in the natural gas business in recent years due to increased demand for natural gas in new construction 
avista utilities also makes sales and provides transportation service directly to large natural gas customers 
most of avista utilities large industrial customers purchase their own natural gas requirements through gas marketers 
for these customers  avista utilities provides transportation from its pipeline interconnection to the customer s premises 
avista utilities has numerous special contracts for natural gas transportation service  most of which contain negotiated rates for its distribution service based on the customer s competitive alternatives 
seven of avista utilities largest natural gas customers are provided natural gas transportation service by avista utilities under special contracts 
these negotiated contracts were entered into to retain these customers who can either by pass avista utilities distribution system or have avista corporation competitive alternative fuel capability 
all special contracts are subject to regulatory review and approval 
the competitive nature of the spot natural gas market results in savings in the cost of purchased natural gas  which encourages large customers with fuel switching capabilities to continue to utilize natural gas for their energy needs 
the total volume transported on behalf of transportation customers for  and was approximately  and million therms  which represented approximately  and of avista utilities total system deliveries 
natural gas resources natural gas supply a diverse portfolio of resources allows avista utilities to capture market opportunities that benefit its natural gas customers 
natural gas supplies are available from both domestic and canadian sources through both long and short term  or spot market  purchases 
avista utilities holds capacity on six pipelines and owns natural gas storage facilities  which allows avista utilities to optimize its available resources 
the company s energy trading and marketing subsidiary  avista energy  is responsible for the daily management and optimization of these resources for the requirements of customers in the states of washington  idaho and oregon under an agreement with avista utilities 
under this relationship  avista utilities retains ownership of its transportation  storage and long term contracts and avista energy acts as an agent to optimize these important resources 
the utility commissions of these states have approved benchmark incentive mechanisms that allow avista utilities and its customers to share some of the benefits of avista energy s resource optimization activities 
see regulatory issues for additional information 
firm natural gas supplies are purchased by avista utilities through negotiated agreements having terms ranging between one month and seven years 
during  approximately one third of avista utilities purchases were in the short term market  with contracts on a month to month basis 
approximately of the natural gas supply was obtained from domestic sources  with the remaining from canadian sources 
nearly all natural gas purchased from canadian sources is contracted in us dollar denominations  limiting any foreign currency exchange exposure 
avista utilities does not consider canadian natural gas supplies to be at greater risk of non delivery than us supplies 
avista utilities holds capacity on six natural gas pipelines  northwest pipeline company nwp  pgt  paiute pipeline paiute  tuscarora gas transmission company tuscarora  nova pipeline  ltd 
nova and alberta natural gas co 
ltd 
ang  which provide it access to both domestic and canadian natural gas supplies 
avista utilities contracts with nwp for three types of firm service transportation  liquefied natural gas storage and underground storage  with paiute for firm transportation and liquefied natural gas storage and with pgt  tuscarora  nova and ang for firm transportation only 
jackson prairie natural gas storage project storage project avista utilities owns a one third interest in the storage project  an underground natural gas storage field located near chehalis  washington 
the role of the storage project in providing flexible natural gas supplies is increasingly important to avista utilities natural gas operations 
it enables avista utilities to place natural gas into storage when prices are low or to meet minimum natural gas purchasing requirements  as well as to withdraw natural gas from storage when spot prices are high or as needed to meet high demand periods 
during  avista utilities completed the process of increasing the capacity at the storage project 
this increased capacity is being operated and managed by avista energy for the next ten years in order to optimize the value of this natural gas storage asset 
avista utilities has contracted to release some of its storage project capacity to two other utilities until and  with a provision under one of the releases to partially recall the released capacity if avista utilities determines additional natural gas storage is required for its own system supply 
regulatory issues avista utilities  as a regulated public utility  is currently subject to regulation by state utility commissions with respect to prices  accounting  the issuance of securities and other matters 
the retail electric operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the wutc and the ipuc 
the retail natural gas operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the wutc  the ipuc  the oregon public utility commission opuc and the california public utilities commission cpuc 
avista utilities is also subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc for its wholesale natural gas rates charged for the release of capacity from the jackson prairie storage project 
in each regulatory jurisdiction  the price avista utilities may charge for retail electric and natural gas services other than specially negotiated retail rates for industrial or large commercial customers  which are subject to regulatory review and approval is currently determined on a cost of service basis and is designed to provide  after recovery of allowable operating expenses  an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on rate base 
rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost net of accumulated depreciation of utility plant in service  subject to various adjustments for avista corporation deferred taxes and other items 
over time  rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation of utility plant 
as the energy business is restructured  traditional cost of service ratemaking may evolve into some other form of ratemaking 
rates for transmission services are based on the cost of service principles and are set forth in tariffs on file with the ferc

general rate cases in the company s last general electric rate case in the state of idaho  the ipuc granted a rate increase of million  or  with an authorized return on common equity  effective august  on october   the company filed for a general electric rate increase of million  or  with the wutc 
the company is requesting a return on common equity of  based on a target capital structure for the utility of debt  preferred securities and common equity 
the company is also requesting a power cost adjustment pca similar to the one in effect in idaho 
see below for information about the idaho pca 
an order is expected in the latter part of the company s last general electric rate case in the state of washington was effective in march  with an allowed return on common equity of 
on october   the company filed for a general natural gas rate increase of million  or  with the wutc 
the company is requesting a return on common equity of  based on a target capital structure for the utility of debt  preferred securities and common equity 
an order is expected in the latter part of on june   the company filed for a general natural gas rate increase of million with the wutc 
the company s last general natural gas rate cases involving litigated cost of capital resulted in an allowed return on common equity of for the state of washington  effective august  and for the state of idaho  effective october in december  the opuc approved a stipulation that settled the main issues associated with a staff investigation into purchased gas adjustment pga related earnings issues 
the settlement requires a general earnings review in the spring of each year 
the adjusted earnings will be calculated on the prior calendar year test year  with minor regulatory adjustments  but will not be adjusted for weather 
an earnings threshold will be determined annually by adding basis points to the average of the test year annual yields reported monthly on  and year us treasuries 
for  the threshold rate was 
if adjusted earnings are above the threshold  the company will retain two thirds of the earnings exceeding the threshold  and revenues representing the remaining one third will be shared with customers through a temporary rate adjustment 
power cost adjustment pca the company has a pca mechanism in idaho that tracks changes in hydroelectric generation  secondary energy prices  related changes in thermal generation  as well as changes in purpa contracts  but not changes in revenues or costs associated with other wheeling or power contracts 
rate changes are triggered when the deferred balance reaches million  provided no more than two surcharges or rebates are in effect at the same time 
see note of notes to financial statements for additional information 
purchased gas adjustment pga or natural gas trackers natural gas trackers are supplemental tariffs filed with state regulatory commissions which are designed to pass through changes in purchased natural gas costs  and do not normally result in any changes in net income to the company 
in november  the company filed a natural gas tracker with the wutc requesting a million  or  increase  which was approved  effective january  in november  the opuc approved a million  or  increase effective december  in september  the company filed a natural gas tracker with the ipuc requesting a million  or  increase  which was approved  effective november  natural gas benchmark mechanism the company received regulatory approval of its natural gas benchmark mechanism on february   june  and august  by the ipuc  wutc and opuc  respectively 
the mechanism eliminates natural gas procurement operations within avista utilities and consolidates gas procurement operations under avista energy  the company s non regulated affiliate 
the ownership of the natural gas assets remains with avista utilities  but the assets are managed by avista energy through an agency agreement 
a reduced natural gas staff remains in avista utilities to prepare load forecasts and analyses related to long term resource acquisitions  to manage the agency agreement with avista energy and to support state and federal regulatory activities 
the natural gas benchmark mechanism was implemented september  and runs through march  consolidation of natural gas procurement operations under avista energy allows the company to gain synergies and better manage its risk by combining and operating the two portfolios as one portfolio and gain efficiencies by eliminating duplicate functions 
the natural gas benchmark mechanism provides certain guaranteed benefits to retail customers as well as provides the company with the opportunity to improve earnings  ie  a performance based mechanism

avista corporation energy trading and marketing the energy trading and marketing line of business includes avista energy  avista power and avista steag 
avista energy and avista power are wholly owned subsidiaries of avista capital 
avista steag is owned by avista capital 
avista capital s total equity investment in this line of business was approximately million on december  avista energy avista energy is an electricity and natural gas marketing and trading business focused on marketing energy in the western united states 
in  avista energy began conducting business on a national basis with its acquisition of vitol gas electric  llc vitol 
however  in november  the decision was made to reduce avista energy s risk by redirecting its focus away from national energy trading and marketing toward a more regionally based energy marketing and trading effort in the west backed by contracts for energy commodities and by the output of specific facilities available under contract 
the decision came as a result of avista energy s inability to effectively and consistently compete on a national basis with the larger trading and marketing companies 
avista energy s headquarters are currently in boston  massachusetts with offices in houston  texas  spokane  washington  portland  oregon  and vancouver  british columbia  canada 
as a result of the restructuring  avista energy is closing the boston and houston offices and relocating headquarters back to spokane in the first half of avista energy is in the business of buying and selling electricity and natural gas 
avista energy s customers include commercial and industrial end users  electric utilities  natural gas distribution companies and other trading companies 
avista energy also trades electricity and natural gas derivative commodity instruments  including futures  options  swaps and other contractual arrangements on national exchanges and through unregulated exchanges and brokers from whom these commodity derivatives are available 
during  avista energy also sold and traded coal and sulfur dioxide so allowances  but it is avista energy s intent to eliminate these activities in however  that is dependent upon finding a buyer for the coal contracts already entered into 
in  avista energy sold approximately million mwhs of electric energy  million dekatherms of natural gas and million tons of coal  compared to approximately million mwhs of electric energy and million dekatherms of natural gas in no coal was sold in these volumes  and the associated revenues  will all decline in the future as a result of the restructuring 
avista energy s business is affected by many factors  including the demand for and availability of energy  lower unit margins on new sales contracts  fewer long term power contracts being entered into  resulting in a heavier reliance on short term power contracts which have lower margins than long term contracts  marginal fuel prices  and deregulation of the electric utility industry 
in april  avista energy entered into a marketing agreement with chelan county public utility district chelan pud  located in washington state 
the agreement allows avista energy to market  on a real time basis  a portion of the output from chelan pud s hydroelectric resources and to jointly market energy products and services to other utilities in the region 
twenty eight percent  or megawatts  of total generated capacity from chelan pud s hydroelectric resources are available for real time scheduling and resource optimization 
avista energy and chelan pud offer a variety of products  all designed to help smaller utilities adjust to the emerging energy market 
on october   a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief was filed in chelan county superior court by james a 
brown  a taxpayer and ratepayer of the chelan pud  in order to determine whether the joint marketing and real time scheduling efforts of chelan pud and avista energy are within chelan pud s lawful authority to undertake 
this lawsuit was dismissed on july   and avista energy and chelan pud continue to operate under the contractual alliance 
effective september   avista energy began managing avista utilities natural gas assets and natural gas purchasing operations 
under the agreement  avista energy serves as agent for avista utilities  managing its pipeline transportation and natural gas storage assets  as well as purchasing natural gas for avista utilities retail customers 
the assets continue to be owned by avista utilities  but they are fully integrated operationally into avista energy s portfolio to optimize the value 
the incentive plan allows avista energy the opportunity to retain a portion of the benefits associated with asset optimization and the efficiencies gained in purchasing natural gas for avista utilities 
approvals were received from the state regulatory agencies in washington  idaho and oregon 
the incentive plan began september  and ends march  avista utilities may seek continuation of the plan from regulators with six months notice prior to the end of the term 
avista corporation the participants in the emerging wholesale energy market are public utility companies and  increasingly  power marketers which may or may not be affiliated with public utility companies or other entities 
the participants in this market trade not only electricity and natural gas as commodities  but also derivative commodity instruments such as futures  forwards  swaps  options and other instruments 
this market is largely unregulated and most transactions are conducted on an over the counter basis  there being no central clearing mechanism except in the case of specific instruments traded on the commodity exchanges 
power marketers  whether or not affiliated with other entities  generally do not own production facilities and are not subject to net capital or other requirements of any regulatory agency

the other subsidiaries in this line of business are avista development and avista services 
at december   avista capital s total equity investment in this line of business was approximately million  of which million related to pentzer 
pentzer pentzer  a private investment fund specializing in profitable middle market businesses  was the parent company for a majority of avista corp 
s other subsidiary businesses until  when it sold two groups of its portfolio companies 
in the past  pentzer s business strategy has been to acquire controlling interests in a broad range of middle market companies  facilitate improved productivity and growth  and ultimately sell such companies to the public or a strategic buyer 
total equity investment in any one company was generally limited to million 
beginning in  pentzer s business strategy is to invest in companies that are positioned to be leaders in emerging technology and information businesses that are linked to the energy business 
the investments will be directly in businesses that meet these criteria  and indirectly  through the strategic investment in certain venture capital firms that invest in similar business segments and where pentzer has the opportunity to directly invest in specific portfolio companies 
pentzer s goal is to produce strategic growth opportunities and financial returns for the company s shareholders that  over the long term  should be higher than that of the utility operations 
from time to time  a significant portion of pentzer s earnings contributions may be the result of transactional gains 
transactional gains arise from a one time event or a specific transaction  such as the sale of an investment or company from pentzer s portfolio of investments 
in  pentzer generated million in after tax transactional gains due to sales of portfolio companies

avista corporation industry restructuring federal level industry restructuring to remove certain barriers to competition in the electric utility industry was initially promoted by federal legislation 
the energy policy act of energy act confers expanded authority upon the ferc to issue orders requiring electric utilities to transmit power and energy to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers  and to require electric utilities to enlarge or construct additional transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services 
the ferc issued its final rule in order no 
in april that order requires public utilities operating under the federal power act to provide access to their transmission systems to third parties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ferc s pro forma open access transmission tariff 
ferc order no 
 the companion rule to order no 
 requires public utilities to establish an open access same time information system oasis to provide transmission customers with information about available transmission capacity and other information by electronic means  and requires each public utility subject to the rule to functionally separate its transmission and wholesale power merchant functions 
the ferc issued its initial order accepting the non rate terms and conditions of avista utilities open access transmission tariff in november avista utilities filed its procedures for implementing standards of conduct under ferc order no 
with the ferc in december and adopted these procedures effective january  ferc orders no 
and no 
have not had a significant material effect on avista utilities operating results 
on december   the ferc issued a final rule in order no 
regarding the development of regional transmission organizations rto 
this final rule requires public utilities subject to ferc regulation to file an rto proposal  or a description of efforts to participate in an rto  and any existing obstacles to rto participation  by october avista utilities and various northwest utilities initially investigated the feasibility of transferring certain operational responsibilities associated with a regional transmission grid to an independent grid operator in avista utilities withdrew from this effort in december because the costs to establish an independent grid operator in the northwest were greater than the perceived benefits 
notwithstanding the ferc s developing policies  avista utilities has continued to explore other regional transmission alternatives intended to help facilitate a competitive electric power market  including the development of an rto that might provide quantifiable efficiencies in administering access to the northwest transmission system in a non discriminatory fashion 
in response to the ferc s order  avista utilities will be submitting its response on rto development and participation to the ferc by october the north american electric reliability council and the wscc have undertaken initiatives to establish a series of security coordinators to oversee the reliable operation of the regional transmission system 
accordingly  avista utilities  in cooperation with other utilities in the pacific northwest  has established the pacific northwest security coordinator pnsc  which oversees daily and short term operations of the northwest sub regional transmission grid  and has limited authority to direct certain actions of control area operators in the case of a pending transmission system emergency 
avista utilities executed its service agreement with the pnsc in september state level further competition may be introduced by state action 
competition for retail customers is not generally allowed in avista utilities service territory 
while the energy act precludes the ferc from mandating retail wheeling  state regulators and legislators could open service territories to full competition at the retail level 
legislative action at the state level would be required for full retail wheeling and customer choice to occur in washington and idaho 
from through  the legislatures and public utility commissions in washington and idaho have covered a series of hearings and conducted several studies regarding electric industry restructuring 
issues such as unbundling  deregulation  reliability and consumer protection have been examined 
impacts on customer service quality and system reliability generation  transmission and distribution have been considered on a macro basis under various restructuring scenarios 
public policy makers in washington and idaho continue to examine other states experiences with restructuring  while cognizant that the pacific northwest generally benefits from the lowest electric rates in the country 
in  governor locke issued an executive order requiring all agencies in the state of washington to review their significant rules under the criterion of need  efficiency  clarity and cost 
the wutc is in the process of examining its electric and natural gas rules 
resulting modifications to existing rules may include changes to customer service and reliability standards 
avista utilities believes that any such modifications to the wutc s existing rules will not materially impact operations 
avista corporation avista utilities has developed a model to offer broader customer choice 
the portfolio access model pa model was developed as a transition to full direct access 
under the pa model  large use customers would receive direct access  while small use customers would be provided a menu of services priced at market rates  such as monthly and annual pricing  as well as optional green rates for renewable power 
the pa model has served as a regional proposal under discussion by legislative committees and work groups in washington  idaho and oregon 
in  the oregon legislature voted into law an electric restructuring system similar to avista utilities pa model 
more options for power services ii mops ii is avista utilities pa model regulatory pilot 
on january   the cpuc granted avista utilities a full exemption to the cpuc s affiliate transaction rules  provided that avista utilities complies with its voluntary agreement that none of its affiliates will participate in business activities in its south lake tahoe service territory 
these rules require that a utility s energy marketing affiliates follow detailed operating and reporting protocols as well as full separation from the regulated entity for any business activity in california 
avista utilities also agreed to provide periodic reports from an independent auditor verifying that its affiliates have not participated directly or indirectly within this service territory 
experimental programs to assess the potential impact of competition and customer choice  commencing in  avista utilities has implemented a variety of experimental programs that permitted its retail customers to choose other energy suppliers 
the cost of these programs to avista utilities  in terms of lost margin  has not been material 
on the basis of its experience under these programs  avista utilities believes that if the states of washington and or idaho adopted legislation providing for customer choice  the effect on its results of operations would not be material 
this is due largely to avista utilities current retail rates  which are among the lowest in the us  and avista utilities ability to sell capacity and energy in wholesale markets without any significant loss of margin 
avista corporation environmental issues the company is subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
the generation  transmission  distribution  service and storage facilities in which avista utilities has an ownership interest have been designed to comply with all environmental laws presently applicable 
furthermore  the company conducts periodic reviews of all its facilities and operations to anticipate emerging environmental issues 
the company s board of directors has an environmental committee to deal specifically with these issues 
air quality 
the most significant impact of the clean air act caa and the clean air act amendments caaa is on the centralia steam electric plant  which is classified as a phase ii coal plant under the caaa 
construction is underway to install limestone scrubbers on both units 
the first unit will go into operation in and the second in the scrubbers are expected to result in a reduction in sulfur dioxide so emissions 
this level of reduction exceeds the requirements of the caa and meets the ract reasonably available control technology order by the southwest washington pollution control authority swapca 
the plant will also install low nitrogen oxide nox burners to reduce the emission of nox 
the standards in the ract order were established by a collaborative decision making group consisting of representatives from federal and state agencies and the plant owners 
avista utilities and the other owners decided to take bids for the sale of the centralia steam electric plant and have announced transalta of calgary as the selected bidder in the auction process 
the sale must be approved by federal and state regulators  as well as the city councils and directors who control the municipal utilities and public utility districts that also have ownership interests in the plant 
regulatory approvals have been received from the ferc and state commissions in washington  idaho  oregon and wyoming 
commissions in utah and california have yet to make their decisions 
the company is reviewing the terms of the approvals from the wutc and the ipuc to determine whether to agree to the sale 
obligations under the caa would be assumed by transalta if the sale of the centralia steam electric plant is completed 
colstrip  which is also a phase ii coal fired plant under the caaa  is not expected to be required to implement any additional so mitigation in the foreseeable future in order to continue operations 
avista utilities other thermal projects also are subject to various caaa standards 
every five years each project requires an updated operating permit known as a title v permit which addresses  among other things  the compliance of the plant with the caaa 
no permits are required at any of avista utilities thermal plants in see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future outlook and note to financial statements for additional information

revenues from these sales are offset by like increases in purchased gas expense  and margins from these transactions are credited back to customers through rate changes for the cost of natural gas 
non retail sales decreased in primarily due to the agreement whereby avista energy serves as agent for avista utilities  managing its pipeline transportation and natural gas storage assets  as well as purchasing natural gas for avista utilities customers  in order to optimize the value of its resources 
avista energy will make these sales in the future  if it is optimal to managing the natural gas portfolio

purchased power volumes increased and prices were higher in than  which resulted in a million  or  increase in purchased power expense in over natural gas purchased costs increased million due to increased therm sales 
fuel for generation increased million due to increased generation at the thermal plants as a result of increased wholesale electric sales 
energy trading and marketing energy trading and marketing includes the results of avista energy  avista power  and avista steag 
avista power and avista steag operations had little or no impact on earnings in either or although avista energy began incurring start up costs during  it only became operational in july and began trading operations in august avista energy maintains a trading portfolio that it marks to fair market value on a daily basis mark to market accounting  and which may cause earnings variability in the future 
avista corporation compared to energy trading and marketing income available for common stock for was an after tax loss of million compared to earnings of million in the primary reason for the decrease was a million after tax charge recorded by avista energy related to the downsizing and restructuring of the business  and million of after tax operational losses due to warmer than normal weather across the nation  soft national energy markets and a lack of volatility within those markets 
the restructuring charge consists of a million after tax charge for the write off of goodwill from the purchase of vitol in february and a million after tax reserve for severance payments and other related expenses 
avista energy recognized losses on positions taken in anticipation of certain weather patterns in particular areas of the country  which lost value when the expected patterns did not occur  and on options  also taken in anticipation of certain weather patterns in particular areas of the country  which expired unexercised when the expected patterns did not occur 
see liquidity and capital resources risk management for additional information about market risk and credit risk 
since its inception in  avista energy has developed and expanded its business and added experienced traders and staff 
this growth continued in with avista energy s purchase of vitol in the first quarter 
vitol  located in boston  massachusetts  was one of the top energy marketing companies in the united states 
late in the second quarter of  avista energy added a significant number of energy professionals in its spokane and houston offices 
the integration of vitol operations into avista energy began during the second quarter with the consolidation of back office support  improvements in accounting and trading processes and personnel  and continued enhancements in risk management systems across avista energy 
in november  the decision was made to reduce avista energy s risk by redirecting its focus away from national energy trading toward a more regionally based energy marketing and trading effort in the west backed by contracts for energy commodities and by the output of specific facilities available under contract 
the change in strategy followed significant changes in the overall energy trading and marketing industry that created low margins while requiring higher levels of investment  credit commitments and value at risk limits 
mergers and consolidations within the industry also created a small number of large players  and a marketplace where liquidity and volatility were not favorable 
avista energy is shutting down its operations in houston and boston  which will eliminate approximately positions 
avista energy sought a buyer for the eastern book of business  and is currently in the process of closing that transaction 
the electric contracts will likely be sold at approximately book value 
to date  avista energy has not found a buyer for the natural gas or coal contracts 
avista energy already has prudency and credit reserves recorded on its books that will likely cover any remaining risks associated with these eastern contracts 
during  avista energy derived the majority of its revenues from trading activities  rather than marketing activities 
marketing activities are defined as structured deals with non standard products 
the contracts are usually of one year or longer terms  and are designed to meet the customers specific requirements as to timing and amounts 
customers are primarily large  end use customers or utilities 
with the redirection in focus  avista energy plans to eventually derive more revenues from marketing activities rather than trading activities 
however  due to the current portfolio of contracts in place  it will require several years to fully accomplish this transition 
current expectations are for losses to continue through the first three quarters of due to contracts still in place and further expenses relating to the downsizing of the business 
energy trading and marketing s revenues and operating expenses increased billion and billion  respectively  in over the increase in revenues and expenses was primarily the result of avista energy continuing to grow its business

future outlook business strategy regulatory  economic and technological changes have brought about the accelerating transformation of the utility and energy industries  creating new opportunities to expand the company s businesses and serve new markets 
in pursuing such opportunities  the company s strategy is to focus on continuing its growth as a leading provider of energy  and information and technology services 
the company seeks to maintain a strong  low cost utility business as well as to focus on growing avista advantage  avista labs and avista communications 
the company intends to continue investing in the development of these growth subsidiaries while continuing to search for opportunities to grow its utility business and increase its asset and customer base 
key strengths of the company include its position as a leading e commerce portal for energy facility management and patented web based programming  a developer of innovative fuel cell technology  and a regional provider of telecommunications and fiber optics services  as well as being one of the lowest cost producers of power in the nation 
locally 
part of the company s strategy for was to expand the utility service territory through acquisitions  but the lack of economically feasible acquisition opportunities and the uncertainty of favorable state commission approvals led to a change in strategies 
the company decided to concentrate on other growth avenues  such as the avista corporation information and technology businesses  to generate shareholder value 
however  the company will selectively add to its already strong foundation of state regulated utility assets  solidifying its position as a leading supplier of low cost electric and natural gas energy services  if the right opportunities arise 
the company will also continue to grow its rate base through customer growth and capital expenditures 
regionally 
the company plans to concentrate on growing its telecommunications and fiber optic business as part of its overall strategic focus on generating shareholder value 
in addition  the company plans to add to its regulated and non regulated energy related assets on a regional basis as the industry consolidates to further optimize its assets and create greater economies of scale 
the growth is expected to be driven by the company s significant base of knowledge and experience in the operation of physical systems for both electric energy and natural gas in the region  as well as its relationship focused approach to the customer 
nationally 
the company will seek to expand its customer base through the growth of avista advantage  with its internet based specialty billing and information services  and avista labs  with its innovative fuel cell technologies  as part of its overall strategic focus on generating shareholder value 
the company s growth strategy exposes it to risks  including risks associated with rapid expansion  challenges in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel  risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures  and increasing competition 
in addition  the energy trading and marketing business exposes the company to the financial and credit risks associated with commodity trading activities 
the company believes that its extensive experience in the electric and natural gas business  coupled with its strong management team  will allow the company to effectively manage its further development as a diversified energy  information and technology company 
in  the company conducted the majority of its non energy business through pentzer  its wholly owned subsidiary 
pentzer s business strategy was to acquire controlling interests in a broad range of middle market companies  facilitate improved productivity and growth  and ultimately sell such companies to the public or a strategic buyer 
beginning in  pentzer s business strategy is to invest in companies that are positioned to be leaders in emerging technology and information businesses that are linked to the energy business 
the investments will be directly in businesses that meet these criteria  and indirectly  through the strategic investment in certain venture capital firms that invest in similar business segments and where pentzer has the opportunity to directly invest in specific portfolio companies 
pentzer s goal is to produce strategic growth opportunities and financial returns for the company s shareholders that  over the long term  should be higher than that of the utility operations 
general competition and business risk avista utilities continues to compete for new retail electric customers with various rural electric cooperatives and public utility districts in and adjacent to its service territories 
challenges facing the retail electric business include evolving technologies that provide alternate energy supplies  the cost of the energy supplied  the potential for retail wheeling  self generation and fuel switching by commercial and industrial customers and increasingly stringent environmental laws 
when electric utility companies are required to provide retail wheeling service  avista utilities believes it will be in a position to benefit since it is committed to remaining one of the country s lowest cost providers of electric energy 
consequently  avista utilities believes it faces minimal risk for stranded generation  transmission or distribution assets due to its low cost structure 
avista utilities need for new future electric resources to serve retail loads is expected to remain very minimal 
natural gas remains competitively priced compared to other alternative fuel sources for residential  commercial and industrial customers and is projected to remain so into the future due to abundant supplies and competition 
challenges facing avista utilities retail natural gas business include the potential for customers to by pass its natural gas system 
to reduce the potential for such by pass  avista utilities prices its natural gas services  including transportation contracts  competitively and has varying degrees of flexibility to price its transportation and delivery rates by means of special contracts 
avista utilities has long term transportation contracts with seven of its largest industrial customers  which reduces the risks of these customers by passing the system in the foreseeable future 
avista utilities and avista energy continue to compete in the electric wholesale market with other utilities  federal marketing agencies and power marketers 
it is expected that competition to sell capacity will remain vigorous  and that prices will remain depressed for at least the next several years  due to increased competition and surplus capacity in the western united states 
competition related to the sale of capacity and energy is influenced by many factors  including the availability of capacity in the western us  the availability and prices of natural gas and oil  spot energy prices and transmission access 
business challenges affecting the avista utilities and energy trading and marketing lines of business include competition from low cost generation being developed by independent power producers  avista corporation declining margins due to a greater reliance on short term sales  evolving technologies that provide alternate energy supplies and deregulation of electric and natural gas markets 
the company s energy related businesses are exposed to risks  including risks relating to changes in certain commodity prices and counterparty performance 
in order to manage the various risks relating to these exposures  the company utilizes electric  natural gas and related commodity derivatives  and has established risk management oversight for these risks for each area of the company s energy related business 
the company has implemented procedures to manage such risk and has established a comprehensive risk management committee  separate from the units that create such risk exposure and overseen by the audit and finance committee of the company s board of directors  to monitor compliance with the company s risk management policies and procedures 
the avista capital subsidiaries are also subject to competition and business risks  among other risks  as they evolve more fully  particularly the information and technology companies 
competition from other companies in these emerging industries may mean challenges for a company to be the first to market a new product or service to gain the advantage in market share 
in order to grow these new businesses as planned  one significant challenge will be the availability of funding and resources to meet the capital needs 
other challenges will be rapidly advancing technologies  possibly making some of the current technology quickly obsolete  and requiring continual research and development for product advancement 
in order for some of these subsidiaries to succeed  they will need to reduce costs of these emerging technologies to make them affordable to future customers 
energy trading business the participants in the wholesale energy market are public utility companies and  increasingly  power and natural gas marketers which may or may not be affiliated with public utility companies or other entities 
the participants in this market trade not only electricity and natural gas as commodities but also derivative commodity instruments such as futures  forwards  swaps  options and other instruments 
this market is largely unregulated and most transactions are conducted on an over the counter basis  there being no central clearing mechanism except in the case of specific instruments traded on the commodity exchanges 
power marketers  whether or not affiliated with other entities  generally do not own production facilities and are not subject to net capital or other requirements of any regulatory agency 
avista utilities and avista energy are subject to the various risks inherent in commodity trading including  particularly  market risk and credit risk 
market risk is  in general  the risk of fluctuation in the market price of the commodity being traded and is influenced primarily by supply in the case of electricity  adequacy of generating reserve margins  as well as scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities or disruptions to transmission facilities and demand caused by extreme variations in the weather and other factors 
market risk includes the risk of fluctuation in the market price of associated derivative commodity instruments 
all market risk is influenced to the extent that the performance or non performance by market participants of their contractual obligations and commitments affect the supply of  or demand for  the commodity 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss that avista utilities and or avista energy would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
credit risk may be concentrated to the extent that one or more groups of counterparties have similar economic  industry or other characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in market or other conditions 
in addition  credit risk includes not only the risk that a counterparty may default due to circumstances relating directly to it  but also the risk that a counterparty may default due to circumstances which relate to other market participants which have a direct or indirect relationship with such counterparty 
avista utilities and avista energy seek to mitigate credit risk and concentrations thereof by applying specific eligibility criteria to prospective counterparties 
however  despite mitigation efforts  defaults by counterparties occur from time to time 
to date  no such default has had a material adverse effect on avista utilities or avista energy 
avista capital provides guarantees for avista energy s line of credit agreement  and in the course of business may provide guarantees to other parties with whom avista energy may be doing business 
the company s investment in avista capital totaled million at december  risk management the risk management process established by the company is designed to measure both quantitative and qualitative risk in the business 
avista utilities and avista energy have adopted policies and procedures to manage the risks inherent in their businesses and have established a comprehensive risk management committee  separate from the units that create the risk exposure and overseen by the audit and finance committee of the company s board of directors  to monitor compliance with the company s risk management policies and procedures on a regular basis 
nonetheless  adverse changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates may result in losses in earnings  cash flow and or fair values 
the forward looking information presented below provides only estimates of what may occur in the future  assuming certain adverse market conditions  due to reliance on model assumptions 
as a result  actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
these disclosures are not indicators of expected future losses  but only indicators of reasonably possible losses 
interest rate risk the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
the fair value of the company s cash and short term investment portfolio and the fair value of notes payable at december  approximated carrying value 
given the short term nature of these instruments  market risk  as measured by the change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates  is immaterial 
the company manages interest rate risk by taking advantage of market conditions when timing the issuance of long term financings and optional debt redemptions and through the use of fixed rate long term debt with varying maturities 
a portion of the company s capitalization consists of floating rate pollution control bonds  of which the interest rate resets periodically  and company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred trust securities  of which the interest portion of the million series b resets on a quarterly basis  both reflecting current market conditions 
as of december   a hypothetical change in interest rates would result in an immaterial change in the company s cash flows related to the increased interest expense associated with these floating rate securities 
commodity price risk avista utilities and avista energy are exposed to market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electric and natural gas commodities and  therefore  utilize derivative commodity instruments to hedge the impact of these fluctuations on their energy related assets  liabilities  and other contractual arrangements 
in addition  avista energy trades these instruments to take advantage of market opportunities 
at times this may create a net open position in its portfolio that could result in material losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated 
the company and avista energy s risk management program and policies are designed to manage the risks associated with market fluctuations in the price of electricity and natural gas commodities see note of notes to financial statements for additional information 
avista energy measures the risk in its derivative commodity portfolio on a daily basis utilizing a value at risk var model and monitors its risk in comparison to established thresholds 
var measures the worst expected loss avista corporation over a given time interval under normal market conditions at a given confidence level 
avista utilities and avista energy also use other measures to monitor the risk in their derivative commodity portfolios on a monthly  quarterly and annual basis 
the var computations are based on an historical simulation  which utilizes price movements over a specified period to simulate forward price curves in the energy markets to estimate the unfavorable impact of one day s price movement in the existing portfolio 
the quantification of market risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products 
var represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses in earnings that would be recognized on its portfolio assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
avista energy s var computations utilize several key assumptions  including a confidence level for the resultant price movement and a one day holding period 
the calculation includes derivative commodity instruments held for trading purposes and excludes the effects of written and embedded physical options in the trading portfolio 
at december   avista energy s estimated potential one day unfavorable impact on gross margin was million  as measured by var  related to its commodity trading and marketing business  compared to million at december  the average daily var for was million  compared to million in after avista energy s restructuring is complete  the average daily var is expected to be less than million 
changes in markets inconsistent with historical trends or assumptions used could cause actual results to exceed predicted limits 
market risks associated with derivative commodity instruments held for purposes other than trading were not material at december  in addition to commodity price risk  avista utilities commodity positions are also subject to operational and event risks including  among others  increases in load demand  transmission or transport disruptions  fuel quality specifications and forced outages at generating plants 
foreign currency risk the company has investments in several canadian companies through avista energy canada  ltd 
and its acquisition of coast pacific management  inc see note for additional information about this acquisition 
the company s exposure to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risk was immaterial to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position in and is not expected to change materially in the near future 
economic and load growth avista utilities expects economic growth to continue in its eastern washington and northern idaho service area 
avista utilities  along with others in the service area  is continuing its efforts to facilitate expansion of existing businesses and attract new businesses to the inland northwest 
although agriculture  mining and lumber were the primary industries for many years  today health care  education  electronic and other manufacturing  tourism and the service sectors are becoming increasingly important industries that operate in avista utilities service area 
avista utilities also anticipates moderate economic growth to continue in its oregon service area 
avista utilities anticipates residential and commercial electric load growth to average approximately annually for the next five years primarily due to increases in both population and the number of businesses in its service territory 
the number of electric customers is expected to increase and the average annual usage by residential customers is expected to remain steady on a weather adjusted basis 
a public utility regulatory policies act of purpa contract with avista utilities largest customer expires in the customer is expected to self generate at that time  which will reduce the load to this customer by the amount avista utilities has been purchasing and then reselling to them 
although it will have no material impact on loads  it will reduce avista utilities costs since the purpa contract is at above market prices 
avista utilities anticipates natural gas load growth  including transportation volumes  in its washington and idaho service area to average approximately annually for the next five years 
the oregon and south lake tahoe  california service areas are anticipated to realize growth annually during that same period 
the anticipated natural gas load growth is primarily due to expected conversions from electric space and water heating to natural gas  and increases in both population and the number of businesses in its service territory 
the forward looking projections set forth above regarding retail sales growth are based  in part  upon purchased baseline economic forecasts and publicly available population and demographic studies 
the expectations regarding retail sales growth are also based upon various assumptions including  without limitation  assumptions relating to avista corporation weather and economic and competitive conditions  internal analysis of company specific data  such as energy consumption patterns and internal business plans  and an assumption that avista utilities will incur no material loss of retail customers due to self generation or retail wheeling 
changes in the underlying assumptions can cause actual experience to vary significantly from forward looking projections 
environmental issues since december  a number of species of fish in the northwest  including the snake river sockeye salmon and fall chinook salmon  the kootenai river white sturgeon  the upper columbia river steelhead  the upper columbia river spring chinook salmon and the bull trout have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa 
thus far  measures which have been adopted and implemented to save the snake river sockeye salmon and fall chinook salmon have not directly impacted generation levels at any of the company s hydroelectric dams 
the company does  however  purchase power from four projects on the columbia river that are being directly impacted by ongoing mitigation measures for salmon and steelhead 
the reduction in generation at these projects is relatively minor  resulting in minimal economic impact on the company at this time 
it is currently not possible to accurately predict the likely economic costs to the company resulting from all future actions 
the company received a new ferc operating license for the cabinet gorge and noxon rapids hydroelectric projects on february  the restoration of native salmonid fish  in particular bull trout  is a principal focus for the company with the new license 
bull trout are native to this area and a threatened listing for bull trout occurred in under the esa 
the company  as directed by the clark fork projects settlement agreement  is working closely with the us fish and wildlife service  native american tribes and the states of idaho and montana to institute coordinated recovery measures on the lower clark fork river 
the new ferc license establishes a plan for bull trout restoration  including annual budget estimates 
the company continues to study the issue of high dissolved gas levels downstream of cabinet gorge during spill periods  as agreed to in the settlement agreement for relicensing of cabinet gorge 
to date  intensive biological studies in the lower clark fork river and lake pend oreille have documented minimal biological effects of high dissolved gas levels on free ranging fish 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  the company will develop an abatement and or mitigation strategy by see note of notes to financial statements for additional information 
year since the company worked on a comprehensive program to address areas of risk associated with the year the year project was organized around project activity teams that were formed to identify  test and fix systems and programs that might be affected by the rollover into the year the company experienced no year related disruptions in its systems used to deliver electricity and natural gas commodities and services to customers  or in any of its other desktop or business systems 
through december   the company spent million in incremental costs for its year project  which were funded through operating cashflows 
avista corporation other on july   the united states district court for the district of idaho issued its finding that the coeur d alene tribe of idaho tribe owns the bed and banks of the coeur d alene lake and the st 
joe river lying within the current boundaries of the coeur d alene reservation 
the disputed bed and banks comprise approximately the southern one third of the coeur d alene lake 
this action had been brought by the united states on behalf of the tribe against the state of idaho 
while the company is not a party to this action  which has been appealed by the state of idaho to the ninth circuit  the company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this decision on storage rights on the reservoir and operation of the company s hydroelectric facilities on the spokane river  downstream of the coeur d alene lake  which is the reservoir for these plants
