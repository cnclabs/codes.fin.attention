overview western digital is a longtime leader in the data storage industry and is leveraging its core strengths to extend its data storage product offerings and expand beyond the traditional market for hard drives into new markets which meet certain predefined criteria 
the company considers new or high growth markets for data or content storage  management  and communication which have few entrenched competitors and offer the prospect of a sustained competitive advantage through unique or proprietary technology 
the hard drive industry  the company s primary business  is intensely competitive and has experienced a great deal of growth  entry and exit of firms  and technological change over the past several years 
this industry is characterized by short product life cycles  dependence upon highly skilled engineering and other personnel  significant expenditures for product development and recurring periods of oversupply 
as a result of operating losses incurred in  the company initiated restructuring programs for its hard drive operations in and to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency 
during  the company combined its personal storage division and enterprise storage group into a single hard drive operating unit  closed its tuas  singapore facility and moved production of its enterprise drives to the company s nearby manufacturing facility in chai chee  singapore 
the combination resulted in a million charge to operations in the third quarter of also during  the company sold its santa clara disk media operations to komag  recording a charge to operations of million  in the fourth quarter of during  the company reorganized its operational and management responsibilities  transferred its hard drive production from singapore to malaysia and closed its singapore operations 
these actions resulted in a net reduction of worldwide headcount of approximately  and net charges to operations of million 
also in  the company exited the enterprise hard drive market  shifting its strategic focus and resources in the enterprise storage market to data content management systems and management software for storage systems 
in connection with this decision  the company closed its rochester  minnesota enterprise hard drive design center 
approximately employees were terminated and restructuring and other charges totaling million were recorded 
during the first quarter of  the company announced a recall of its gb per platter series of wd caviar desktop hard drives because of a reliability problem resulting from a faulty power driver chip manufactured by a third party supplier 
as a result  revenues of approximately million were reversed and the caviar product line was shut down for approximately two weeks  eliminating approximately million of forecasted revenue 
in addition  charges totaling million for estimated costs to recall and repair the affected drives were recorded to cost of revenues in in february  the company acquired its connex subsidiary for approximately million 
connex delivers enterprise class storage functionality for the department and mid sized business markets  including storage management software  network attached storage and storage area networks 
in  the company formed sagetree  inc sagetree  to design and market packaged analytical applications and related services for supply chain and product lifecycle intelligence 
in addition  the company is developing products for consumer audio and video applications 
total operating losses for connex  sagetree and other developing new ventures amounted to million in results of operations summary of  and comparison the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  items in the company s statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenue 
years ended june  july  june  revenues  net costs and expenses cost of revenues research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charges total costs and expenses operating loss net interest and other income expense loss before income taxes and extraordinary item benefit for income taxes loss before extraordinary item extraordinary gain from redemption of debentures net loss the company reported losses before taxes and extraordinary gains of  and million in  and  respectively 
the loss included charges of million in cost of revenues for the company s transition to magnetoresistive head technology  and million in research and development expenses for start up of a technology agreement and terminated engineering programs 
the loss included charges of approximately million for incremental thin film warranty provisions  approximately million in malaysian currency losses  million of in process research and development write offs associated with the acquisition of connex and restructuring charges of million for the consolidation of the company s personal storage and enterprise storage divisions and the sale of its media operation 
the loss included net restructuring charges totaling million for the closure of the company s singapore operations and exit from the enterprise hard drive market 
the loss also included charges to cost of revenues of million for vendor settlements  incremental warranty  and inventory write downs associated with the exit from the enterprise market and million for costs to repair recalled drives 
excluding the aforementioned restructuring and other charges  losses before taxes and extraordinary gains were  and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in losses from to resulted from a million  or  decrease in revenues  a decrease in gross margin percentage and a million  or increase in operating expenses 
the decrease in losses from to resulted from a increase in gross margin percentage on lower revenues million  or a decrease over and a million  or  decrease in operating expenses 
in addition  the loss included million in operating losses for connex  sagetree and other early stage ventures compared with million in and in net revenue consolidated net revenues in of billion decreased  or billion  from as a result of a decrease in unit shipments stemming from the company s transition to magnetoresistive head technology  combined with lower average selling prices asp s 
consolidated net revenues of billion in  decreased billion or from  due to the company s decision in the third quarter of to exit the enterprise hard drive market  a decline in the asp s of desktop hard drive products due to an intensely competitive market  and a decline in desktop hard drive unit shipments of approximately  due largely to the product recall in the first quarter of gross profit gross profit totaled million  or of revenue in  negative million  or of revenue in and million  or of revenue in gross profit for included million of special charges to cost of revenues to accelerate the company s transition to magnetoresistive head technology 
gross profit for included million of special charges to cost of revenues for incremental thin film warranty provision related to a higher lifetime return rate being applied to a larger base of products as a result of the transition in desktop product line technology 
gross profit for includes million of special charges to costs of revenues  related directly to the exit from the enterprise hard drive market and the product recall 
excluding special charges  gross profit was million  or of revenue  million  or of revenue and million  or of revenue  for  and  respectively 
the reduction of gross profit margin from to excluding special charges was primarily due to continued competitive pricing pressure in the desktop hard drive market and lower sales of higher margin enterprise hard drive products 
the increase in the gross profit margin from to excluding special charges was primarily the result of lower manufacturing costs due to the consolidation of desktop hard drive production to a single  highly utilized facility in malaysia  offset by lower volumes and lower asps 
operating expenses research and development expense was million in  an increase of million from the increase was primarily due to the third quarter million charge for in process research and development related to the acquisition of connex 
research and development expense for was million  a decrease of million from the decrease was primarily due to the company s exit from the enterprise hard drive market and expense reduction efforts  partially offset by increased spending at connex  sagetree  and other new ventures 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense was million in  an increase of million from the increase was primarily the result of a million charge on terminated malaysian ringgit hedging contracts recorded in  partially offset by decreased marketing expenditures 
sg a expense in was million  a decrease of million from the decrease in sg a expense was primarily due to the company s exit from the enterprise hard drive market  expense reductions in its desktop hard drive business  a million accrual reduction in the fourth quarter of and the nonrecurrence of a million charge on the terminated hedging contracts recorded in the decrease was partially offset by increased spending at connex  sagetree and other of the company s developing ventures in interest and other income expense  extraordinary item and tax benefit net interest and other income expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the change from to was primarily due to a full year s accrual of original issue discount on the company s convertible debentures and a full year of interest expense incurred on a million term loan 
the increase in net interest and other income in was due to a million gain on disposition of certain investment securities and lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances resulting from the payment in of an outstanding term loan of million and redemption of convertible bonds  offset by a reduced amount of interest income due to lower cash and cash equivalent balances 
during  the company recognized extraordinary gains of million upon retirement of convertible debentures 
the company issued million shares of common stock in exchange for million in face value of its convertible debentures with a book value of million which were retired in non cash transactions 
these redemptions were private  individually negotiated transactions with certain institutional investors 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of million in for the expected benefit of loss carrybacks  partially offset by provisions for income taxes recorded in certain jurisdictions where the company had positive earnings  and an income tax benefit of million in for adjustment of its current tax accruals and certain deferred tax amounts 
these accruals were previously established over time and primarily relate to unremitted income of foreign subsidiaries 
however  due to the significant increase of net operating loss carryforwards in recent years and reevaluation of the accruals after the substantial international restructurings in  the company believes these accruals are no longer necessary 
in  no tax benefit was recorded because additional loss carrybacks were not available and management believed it was more likely than not that the deferred tax benefits generated would not be realized see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents of million at july  and million at june  net cash used in operations was million during as compared to million during excluding cash used for restructuring and product recall activities  cash used for operations was million during as compared to million during cash used for restructuring activities during was million and consisted of expenditures for severance and outplacement and facility renovation costs 
cash used for restructuring and other nonrecurring activities was million during and consisted of expenditures for severance and outplacement  lease cancellations and product recall costs 
the company s cash conversion cycle decreased days in and another days in the conversion cycles consist of the following days of sales outstanding dso of in and in  days of payables outstanding dpo of in and in  and days of inventory on hand of in and in despite this improvement  the cash flows provided by changes in working capital accounts decreased from million in to million in due to an approximate decrease in revenues and corresponding cost of revenues as compared to  and the utilization in of significant accruals recorded in and for thin film warranty  restructuring and other charges 
other uses of cash during included the repayment of bank debt of million  strategic cost method investments of million and net capital expenditures of million 
other sources of cash during included proceeds of million received upon issuance of million shares of the company s stock under the company s equity facility  million received by sagetree upon issuance of preferred stock  million received in connection with stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases  and million received from sales of real property 
capital expenditures in amounted to million to upgrade and expand the company s production capability  replace existing assets  and further develop the company s information systems 
the company received million in connection with stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases in the company anticipates that capital expenditures in will not be more than million and will relate to accommodating new product lines  normal replacement of existing assets and expansion of production capabilities in malaysia 
the company also anticipates cash expenditures of not more than million to be paid in the first half of related to restructuring and special charges accrued during  primarily for settlements with vendors on existing purchase orders related to the company s exit from the enterprise hard drive market 
in february  the company received gross proceeds of million before the initial purchasers discount from an offering of zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due february  the debentures 
the debentures are subordinated to all senior debt  are redeemable at the option of the company any time after february  at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption  and at the holder s option  will be repurchased by the company  as of february   february  or february   or if there is a fundamental change as defined in the debenture documents  at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of repurchase 
the repurchase price may be paid in cash or common stock  at the company s option 
the debentures are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at the rate of shares per  principal amount at maturity 
the principal amount at maturity of the debentures when issued was billion 
during  the company issued million shares of common stock in exchange for debentures with a book value of million  and an aggregate principal amount at maturity of million 
these redemptions were private  individually negotiated transactions with certain institutional investors and resulted in extraordinary gains of million 
as of june   the book value of the remaining outstanding debentures was million and the aggregate principal amount at maturity was million 
between july  and september   the company issued million shares of common stock in exchange for debentures with a book value of million and an aggregate principal amount at maturity of million 
as of september   the aggregate principal amount at maturity was million 
subsequent to june   the company entered into a new three year senior credit facility for its hard drive solutions division hds  replacing a previous facility that had matured on march  the new senior credit facility provides up to million in revolving credit subject to a borrowing base calculation  is secured by hds s accounts receivable  inventory  of the stock in its foreign subsidiaries and other assets 
at the option of hds  borrowings bear interest at either libor with option periods of one to three months or a base rate  plus a margin determined by the borrowing base 
the senior credit facility requires hds to maintain certain amounts of tangible net worth  prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock and contains a number of other covenants 
as of the date hereof  the company was in compliance with these covenants and there were no borrowings under the facility 
under an existing shelf registration statement the equity facility  the company may issue shares of common stock to institutional investors for cash 
the equity facility provides for up to million in cash proceeds of which million had been utilized as of june  shares sold under the facility are at the market price of the company s common stock less a discount ranging from to 
between july  and september   the company issued million shares for cash proceeds of million 
as of september   million of the equity facility had been utilized 
the company had a shareholders deficiency of million as of june  and expects to continue to incur operating losses in however  at june   the company had cash and cash equivalent balances of million and working capital of million 
the company has achieved significant reductions in manufacturing labor and overhead  capital expenditures and operating expenses resulting from the sale in late of the company s media operations  the closure in of the company s two singapore based manufacturing facilities and its enterprise design center and the reduction in worldwide headcount from  at july  to  at june  in addition  the company had the following additional sources of liquidity available as of september   million remaining available under the equity facility  as of september   a senior credit facility providing up to million in revolving credit subject to a borrowing base calculation  and other equity investments that may be disposed of during the next twelve months  including million shares of komag common stock of which million shares were sold during september for net proceeds of million and million shares of vixel common stock 
the combined market value of the remaining million komag shares which can be sold in the next twelve months and the million shares of vixel common stock is approximately million as of september  an additional million shares of komag common stock will become available for disposition in october 
based on the above factors  the company believes its current cash and cash equivalent balances  its existing equity and credit facilities  and other liquidity sources currently available to it  will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs through there can be no assurance that the senior credit facility or the equity facility will continue to be available to the company 
also  the company s ability to sustain its working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors that are discussed below under the heading risk factors relating to western digital particularly 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas was effective for all fiscal quarters for fiscal years beginning after june  in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no

sfas  which defers the effective date of sfas to all fiscal quarters for fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
the application of these statements is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  and the company does not anticipate recording a significant adjustment as a result of the transition to these statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in financial statements 
this staff accounting bulletin summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company will be required to follow the guidance in sab no later than its fourth quarter of  with restatement of earlier quarters in required  if necessary 
the sec has recently indicated it intends to issue further guidance with respect to adoption of specific issues addressed by sab until such time as this additional guidance is issued  the company is unable to assess the impact  if any  sab may have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no

this interpretation is effective july   but certain conclusions in this interpretation cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
year on january   the company incurred nominal impact on its products  equipment  computer systems and applications as a result of the year issue 
the company attributes this to its year readiness efforts 
as of december   systems remediation and integration testing and development of the company s contingency plans had been completed 
supplier management is an ongoing process  and no material impact was felt from lack of supplier readiness at january  although the company did not experience any material problems related to the year issue  there can be no assurances that problems relating to the year issue will not manifest themselves in the future 
expenditures related to the year project  excluding normal replacement of existing capital assets  totaled approximately million 
risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate our operating results depend on our being among the first to market and first to volume with our new products 
to achieve consistent success with computer manufacturer customers we must be an early provider of next generation hard drives featuring leading technology and high quality 
if we fail to consistently maintain or improve our time to market performance with our new products produce these products in sufficient volume within our rapid product cycle qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers performance and quality specifications  or achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and costs with these products then our market share would be adversely affected  which would harm our operating results 
short product life cycles make it difficult to recover the cost of development 
over the past few years hard drive areal density the gigabytes of storage per disk has increased at a much more rapid pace than previously  and we expect this trend to continue 
higher areal densities mean that fewer heads and disks are required to achieve a given drive capacity 
this has significantly shortened product life cycles  since each generation of drives is more cost effective than the previous one 
shorter product cycles make it more difficult to recover the cost of product development 
short product life cycles force us to continually qualify new products with our customers 
due to short product life cycles  we must regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers 
to be considered for qualification we must be among the leaders in time to market with our new products 
once a product is accepted for qualification testing  any failure or delay in the qualification process can result in our losing sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced 
the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume computer manufacturers  most of which continue to consolidate their share of the pc market 
these risks are magnified because we expect cost improvements and competitive pressures to result in declining sales and gross margins on our current generation products 
our average selling prices are declining 
we expect that our average selling prices for hard disk drives will continue to decline 
rapid increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks  and is therefore lower cost 
because of the competitiveness of the hard drive industry  lower costs generally mean lower prices 
this is true even for those products that are competitive and introduced into the market in a timely manner 
our average selling prices decline even further when competitors lower prices to absorb excess capacity  liquidate excess inventories  restructure or attempt to gain market share 
unexpected technology advances in the hard drive industry could harm our competitive position 
if one of our competitors were able to implement a significant advance in head or disk drive technology that enables a step change increase in areal density allowing greater storage of data on a disk  it would harm our operating results 
advances in magnetic  optical  semiconductor or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products 
if these products prove to be superior in performance or cost per unit of capacity  we could be at a competitive disadvantage to the companies offering those products 
the hard drive industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid shifts in market share among the major competitors 
the price of hard drives has fallen over time due to increases in supply  cost reductions  technological advances and price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess inventories or gain market share 
in addition  rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence 
these factors  taken together  result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the industry s major participants 
for example  during and  we lost significant share of the desktop market 
during the first quarter of  the company lost market share as a result of a previously announced product recall  however  we recovered some market share during the remainder of  but our share is still significantly below its level 
our prices and margins are subject to declines due to unpredictable end user demand and oversupply of hard disk drives 
demand for our hard drives depends on the demand for computer systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems 
the demand for computer systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for hard drives in any given period 
as a result  the hard drive market tends to experience periods of excess capacity which typically lead to intense price competition 
if intense price competition occurs  we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected and transition to new products sooner than expected 
changes in the markets for hard drives require us to develop new products 
over the past few years the consumer market for desktop computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced systems  especially those systems priced below  we were late to market with a value line hard drive to serve that market  and we lost market share 
if we are not able to offer a competitively priced value line hard drive for the low cost pc market our market share will likely fall  which could harm our operating results 
the pc market is fragmenting into a variety of computing devices and products 
some of these products  such as internet appliances  may not contain a hard drive 
on the other hand  many industry analysts expect  as do we  that as broadcasting and communications are increasingly converted to digital technology from the older  analog technology  the technology of computers and consumer electronics and communication devices will converge  and hard drives will be found in many consumer products other than computers 
if we are not successful in using our hard drive technology and expertise to develop new products for these emerging markets  it will likely harm our operating results 
we depend on our key personnel 
our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key employees  many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace 
worldwide competition for skilled employees in the hard drive industry is intense 
we have lost a number of experienced hard drive engineers over the past two years as a result of the loss of retention value of their employee stock options because of the decrease in price of our common stock and aggressive recruiting of our employees 
if we are unable to retain our existing employees or hire and integrate new employees  our operating results would likely be harmed 
risk factors relating to western digital particularly loss of market share with a key customer could harm our operating results 
a majority of our revenue comes from a few customers 
for example  during  sales to our top customers accounted for approximately of revenues 
these customers have a wide variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us 
even if we successfully qualify a product with a customer  the customer generally is not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and is able to terminate its relationship with us at any time 
our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance 
if we lose a key customer  or if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs  our operating results would likely be harmed 
for example  this occurred early in the third quarter of in our enterprise hard drive market and is one of the factors which led to our decision to exit the enterprise hard drive market and close our rochester  minnesota facility 
dependence on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components could lead to delays or increased costs 
because we do not manufacture any of the components in our hard drives  an extended shortage of required components or the failure of key suppliers to remain in business  adjust to market conditions  or to meet our quality  yield or production requirements could harm us more severely than our competitors  some of whom manufacture certain of the components for their hard drives 
a number of the components used by us are available from only a single or limited number of qualified outside suppliers 
if a component is in short supply  or a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a component  we may experience delays or increased costs in obtaining that component 
this occurred in september when we had to shut down our caviar product line production for approximately two weeks as a result of a faulty power driver chip which was sole sourced from a third party supplier 
to reduce the risk of component shortages  we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying these components 
as a result  we may have to pay significant cancellation charges to suppliers if we cancel orders  as we did in when we accelerated our transition to magnetoresistive recording head technology  and as we did in as a result of our decision to exit the enterprise hard drive market 
in april  we entered into a three year volume purchase agreement with komag under which we buy a substantial portion of our media components from komag 
this strategic relationship has reduced our media component costs  however  it has increased our dependence on komag as a supplier 
our future operating results will depend substantially on komag s ability to timely qualify its media components in our new development programs and to supply us with these components in sufficient volume to meet our production requirements 
any disruption in komag s ability to manufacture and supply us with media would likely harm our operating results 
to develop new products we must maintain effective partner relationships with our strategic component suppliers 
under our virtual vertical integration business model  we do not manufacture any of the parts used in our hard drives 
as a result  the success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts that are best in class from reliable component suppliers 
to do so we must effectively manage our relationships with our strategic component suppliers 
we must also effectively integrate different products from a variety of suppliers and manage difficult scheduling and delivery problems 
we have only one manufacturing facility  which subjects us to the risk of damage or loss of the facility 
our volume manufacturing operations currently are based in one facility in malaysia 
a fire  flood  earthquake or other disaster or condition affecting our facility would almost certainly result in a loss of substantial sales and revenue and harm our operating results 
manufacturing our products abroad subjects us to numerous risks 
we are subject to risks associated with our foreign manufacturing operations  including obtaining requisite united states and foreign governmental permits and approvals currency exchange rate fluctuations or restrictions political instability and civil unrest transportation delays or higher freight rates labor problems trade restrictions or higher tariffs exchange  currency and tax controls and reallocations loss or non renewal of favorable tax treatment under agreements or treaties with foreign tax authorities 
we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by  among other things  entering into short term  forward exchange contracts 
however  those contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the issuer if currency controls are put in place  as occurred in malaysia during the first quarter of as a result of the malaysian currency controls  we are no longer hedging the malaysian currency risk 
our plan to broaden our business in data and content management  storage and communication takes us into new markets 
we have recently entered the storage subsystem market through our connex subsidiary 
in this market we are facing the challenges of building volume and market share in a market which is new to us but which has several established and well funded competitors 
there is already significant competition for skilled engineers  both in the hardware and software areas  in this market 
our success will depend on connex s ability to develop  introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products  applications and product enhancements  and to attract and retain skilled engineers 
additionally  our competitors in this market have established intellectual property portfolios 
our success will also depend on our ability to license existing intellectual property or create new innovations 
moreover  our competitors established intellectual property portfolios increase our risk of intellectual property litigation 
we are also developing storage devices for the emerging audio visual market 
we will be facing the challenge of developing products for a market that is still evolving and subject to rapid changes and shifting consumer preferences 
there are several competitors which have also entered this emerging market  and there is no assurance that the market for digital storage devices for audio visual content will materialize or support all of these competitors 
we have recently entered the data warehouse software and services market through our sagetree subsidiary and are considering other initiatives related to data and content management  storage and communication 
in any of these initiatives we will be facing the challenge of developing products and services for markets that are still evolving and which have many current and potential competitors 
if we are not successful in these new initiatives it will likely harm our operating results 
our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk of significant litigation 
the hard drive industry has been characterized by significant litigation 
this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights  product liability claims and other types of litigation 
we are currently evaluating notices of alleged patent infringement or notices of patents from patent holders 
we also are a party to several judicial and other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights 
if we conclude that a claim of infringement is valid  we may be required to obtain a license or cross license or modify our existing technology or design a new non infringing technology 
such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly 
we may also be liable for any past infringement 
if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit  an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product 
it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or  if there is a finding of willful infringement  treble damages 
any of these results would likely increase our costs and harm our operating results 
our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 
our success depends  in significant part  on the proprietary nature of our technology  including non patentable intellectual property such as our process technology 
despite safeguards  to the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology  it may be difficult  expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection 
also  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights  we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential 
we rely upon employee  consultant and vendor non disclosure agreements and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information 
however  any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry  which might harm our operating results 
inaccurate projections of demand for our product can cause large fluctuations in our quarterly results 
if we do not forecast total quarterly demand accurately  it can have a material adverse effect on our quarterly results 
we typically book and ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter  which makes it is difficult for us to match our production plans to customer demands 
in addition  our quarterly projections and results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including the timing of orders from and shipment of products to major customers our product mix changes in the prices of our products manufacturing delays or interruptions acceptance by customers of competing products in lieu of our products variations in the cost of components for our products limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers  such as komag competition and consolidation in the data storage industry seasonal and other fluctuations in demand for computers often due to technological advances 
rapidly changing market conditions in the hard drive industry make it difficult to estimate actual results 
we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting 
the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions 
key estimates and assumptions for us include accruals for warranty against product defects price protection adjustments on products sold to resellers and distributors inventory adjustments for write down of inventories to fair value reserves for doubtful accounts accruals for product returns 
the market price of our common stock is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
factors such as the following may significantly affect the market price of our common stock actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors which may decrease the volume and profitability of sales of our existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence new products introduced by us or our competitors periods of severe pricing pressures due to oversupply or price erosion resulting from competitive pressures developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights conditions and trends in the hard drive  data and content management  storage and communication industries changes in financial estimates by securities analysts relating specifically to us or the hard drive industry in general 
in addition  the stock market in recent months has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the stock price of many high technology companies

if we decide to increase or accelerate our capital expenditures or research and development efforts  or if results of operations do not meet our expectations  we could require additional debt or equity financing 
however  we cannot insure that additional financing will be available to us or available on favorable terms 
an equity financing could also be dilutive to our existing stockholders
