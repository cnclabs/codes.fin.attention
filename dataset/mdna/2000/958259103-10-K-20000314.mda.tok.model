overall  the net loss decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in net loss for the year was primarily due to a million  after tax  charge for impairment recorded in in connection with the evaluation of a decrease in product prices and the impact on our bethel  black lake and sand dunes facilities  as required by sfas no 
revenues from the sale of gas decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to average gas sales volumes decreased mmcf per day to  mmcf per day for the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to an decrease in third party sales activity 
the decrease in volumes sold was partially offset by an increase in average gas prices 
our average gas price increased 
per mcf to per mcf for the year ended december  compared to included in this gas price is approximately million of loss recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity volumes 
we have entered into futures positions for a portion of our equity gas for see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources risk management 
revenues from the sale of ngls decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to average ngl sales volumes decreased  mgal per day to  mgal per day for the year ended december  compared to  due to a decrease in third party sales activity of  mgal per day and a decrease in plant sales volumes of mgal per day 
plant ngl sales volumes were largely affected by increased volumes taken in kind and curtailed drilling activity due to low oil prices by a producer behind midkiff  and the sale of our edgewood and giddings facilities 
volumes taken in kind affect sales volumes and revenues but do not materially affect income 
the decrease in sales volumes was partially offset by an increase in average ngl prices 
our average ngl price increased 
per gallon to 
per gallon for the year ended december  compared to included in this ngl price was approximately million of loss recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity volumes 
we have entered into futures positions for a portion of our equity production for see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources risk management 
processing  transportation and storage revenue increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to due to increased volumes transported by our migc pipeline resulting from the activity in the powder river basin 
the reduction in product purchases of million to billion for the year ended december  compared to  was primarily due to a decrease in product prices 
overall  combined product purchases as a percentage of sales of all products remained constant at for the year ended december  compared to our margins on third party sales of natural gas have narrowed from 
per mcf in to 
per mcf in this decrease is partially due to increasing competitiveness in the marketplace 
contributing to this decrease in was the sale of our katy storage facility in april this facility generated higher margins per mcf as we were able to capture the summer winter price differential on our storage position 
we expect marketing margins to remain at the 
per mcf level in plant operating expense decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease was primarily due to the reorganization of our operating areas as a result of the sales of the giddings  mivida  and katy facilities during depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease was primarily due to the sales of the giddings  mivida  and katy facilities during and impairment charges recognized against our bethel and black lake facilities in and interest expense decreased 
million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease is the result of an overall reduction in long term debt of million with the proceeds from our asset sales in the resulting decrease in interest expense was partially offset by higher interest rates on our senior debt facilities and on the senior subordinated debt 
in connection with the repayments on the senior debt  we incurred approximately million of pre tax yield maintenance and other charges 
these charges are reflected as an extraordinary loss from early extinguishment of long term debt in the second quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  s  except per share amounts and operating data year ended december  percent change financial results revenues   gross profit   net income loss   loss per share of common stock basic and diluted

revenues from the sale of gas decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to average gas sales volumes increased mmcf d to  mmcf d for the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to an increase in the sale of gas purchased from third parties 
the increase in volumes sold was more than offset by a decrease in average gas prices

revenue associated with electric power marketing decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to  as we discontinued wholesale trading of electric power in  due to a lack of profitability 
other net revenue increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was primarily due to a million gain on the sale of our perkins facility and a million option payment received from ris in connection with the potential sale of a portion of our assets in southwest wyoming 
these increases were offset by decreases of approximately million in earnings from our investments in joint ventures  primarily due to the decreases in product prices and the sale of our interest in redman smackover 
see further discussion at business significant acquisitions  projects and dispositions southwest wyoming 
the reduction in product purchases of million to billion for the year ended december  compared to  was primarily due to a decrease in commodity prices 
overall  combined product purchases as a percentage of sales of all products increased from to for the year ended december  compared to over the past several years  we have experienced narrowing margins in our third party sales as a result of increasing competitiveness of the natural gas marketing industry 
during the year ended december   margins on the sale of third party gas declined and averaged approximately 
per mcf compared to approximately 
per mcf for contributing to the increase in the product purchase percentage for the year ended december  were higher payments related to our keepwhole contracts at our granger facility 
under a keepwhole contract  our margin is reduced when the value of ngls declines relative to the value of gas 
also included in product purchases were lower of cost or market writedowns  primarily related to ngl inventories  of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
plant operating expense increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was primarily due to compression costs associated with the increasing powder river basin coal bed methane production activities and expenses incurred at the bethel treating facility  which became partially operational during the third quarter of interest expense increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase is the result of less interest capitalized to capital projects  primarily the bethel treating facility  and larger debt balances outstanding during the year ended december  compared to the larger debt balances resulted primarily from higher product inventory positions  capital expenditures associated with the bethel treating facility and reduced cashflow from operations 
business strategy our long term business plan is to increase our profitability by i optimizing the profitability of existing operations  ii entering into additional agreements with third party producers who dedicate acreage to our gathering and processing operations  and iii investing in projects or acquiring assets that complement and extend our core natural gas gathering  processing  production and marketing businesses 
we continually seek to improve the profitability of our existing operations by increasing natural gas throughput levels through new well connections and expansion of gathering systems  increasing our efficiency through the consolidation of existing gathering and processing facilities  evaluating the economic performance of each of our operating facilities to ensure that a targeted rate of return is achieved and controlling operating and overhead expenses 
we continually seek to increase acreage dedicated to our facilities 
our operations are located in some of the most actively drilled oil and gas producing basins in the united states 
we enter into agreements under which we gather and process natural gas produced on acreage dedicated to us by third parties 
we contract for production from new wells and newly dedicated acreage in order to replace declines in existing reserves that are dedicated for gathering and processing at our facilities 
we have increased our dedicated estimated reserves from tcf at december  to tcf at december  in  including the reserves associated with our joint ventures and partnerships and excluding the reserves associated with the facilities sold during this period  we connected new reserves to our facilities to replace approximately of throughput 
in order to obtain additional dedicated acreage and to secure contracts on favorable terms  we may participate to a limited extent with producers in exploration and production activities 
for the same reason  we may also offer to sell an ownership interest in our facilities to selected producers 
we will continue to invest in projects that complement and extend our core natural gas gathering  processing  production and marketing businesses including the consideration of expansion into additional geographic areas in the continental united states and canada 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been net cash provided by operating activities  funds available under our financing facilities and proceeds from offerings of debt and equity securities 
in the past  these sources have been sufficient to meet our needs and finance the growth of our business 
we can give no assurance that the historical sources of liquidity and capital resources will be available for future development and acquisition projects  and we may be required to seek alternative financing sources 
in  sources of liquidity included the sales of the perkins facility and the edgewood facility and related production 
in the second quarter of  we completed the sales of our giddings  katy and mivida facilities 
in connection with the sale of katy  we sold gas held in storage at this facility 
in december  we contracted for the sale of the black lake facility and related reserves 
this sale closed in january the total gross proceeds from the asset sales reported in was million 
we used the proceeds from these sales to reduce debt 
product prices  sales of inventory  the volumes of natural gas processed by our facilities  the margin on third party product purchased for resale  as well as the timely collection of our receivables will affect all future net cash provided by operating activities 
additionally  our future growth will be dependent upon obtaining additions to dedicated plant reserves  acquisitions  new project development  marketing  efficient operation of our facilities and our ability to obtain financing at favorable terms 
we believe that the amounts available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility  together with net cash provided by operating activities and the sale of non strategic assets  will provide us with sufficient funds to connect new reserves  maintain our existing facilities and complete our current capital expenditure program 
depending on the timing and the amount of our future projects  we may be required to seek additional sources of capital 
our ability to secure such capital is restricted by our financing facilities  although we may request additional borrowing capacity from our lenders  seek waivers from our lenders to permit us to borrow funds from third parties  seek replacement financing facilities from other lenders  use stock as a currency for acquisitions  sell existing assets or a combination of such alternatives 
while we believe that we would be able to secure additional financing  if required  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so or as to the terms of any such financing 
we also believe that cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our debt service and preferred stock dividend requirements for historically  while certain individual plants have experienced declines in dedicated reserves  we have been successful in connecting additional reserves to more than offset the natural declines 
there has been a reduction in drilling activity  primarily in basins that produce oil and casinghead gas  from levels that existed in prior years 
however  higher gas prices experienced over the last several years  improved technology  eg  d seismic and horizontal drilling  and increased pipeline capacity from the rocky mountain region have stimulated drilling in the powder river basin and southwest wyoming 
the overall level of drilling will depend upon  among other factors  the prices for gas and oil  the drilling budgets of third party producers  the energy policy of the federal government and the availability of foreign oil and gas  none of which is within our control 
there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in replacing the dedicated reserves processed at our facilities 
we have effective shelf registration statements filed with the commission for an aggregate of million of debt securities and preferred stock  along with the shares of common stock  if any  into which such securities are convertible  and million of debt securities  preferred stock or common stock 
our sources and uses of funds for the year ended december  are summarized as follows in thousands sources of funds borrowings under revolving credit facility  proceeds from the dispositions of property and equipment 
 proceeds from issuance of long term debt  net cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from exercise of common stock options other total sources of funds  uses of funds payments related to long term debt including debt issue costs  capital expenditures  dividends paid  total uses of funds  additional sources of liquidity available to us are our inventories of gas and ngls in storage facilities 
we store gas and ngls primarily to ensure an adequate supply for long term sales contracts and for resale during periods when prices are favorable 
we held gas in storage and in imbalances of approximately bcf at an average cost of per mcf at december  compared to bcf at an average cost of per mcf at december  under storage contracts at various third party facilities 
at december   we had hedging contracts in place for anticipated sales of approximately bcf of stored gas at a weighted average price of per mcf for the stored inventory 
see item and business and properties significant acquisitions  projects and dispositions katy 
we held ngls in storage of mgal  consisting primarily of propane and normal butane  at an average cost of 
per gallon and  mgal at an average cost of 
per gallon at december  and  respectively  at various third party storage facilities 
at december   we had no significant hedging contracts in place for anticipated sales of stored ngls 
one customer accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues from the sale of ngls  or of total consolidated revenue  for the year ended december  this customer is a large integrated utility 
capital investment program for the years ended december   and  we expended million  million and million  respectively  on new projects and acquisitions 
for the year ended december   our expenditures consisted of the following i million for new connects  system expansions and asset consolidations  ii million for maintaining existing facilities  iii million for exploration and production activities and acquisitions of undeveloped acreage  and iv million of miscellaneous expenditures 
we expect capital expenditures related to existing operations to be approximately million during  consisting of the following i approximately million related to gathering  processing and pipeline assets  of which million is for maintaining existing facilities and million for acquisition of the remaining in the westana gathering company  ii approximately million related to exploration and production activities  and iii approximately million for miscellaneous items 
overall  capital expenditures in the powder river basin coal bed methane development and in southwest wyoming operations represent and  respectively  of the total budget 
financing facilities revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is with a syndicate of banks and provides for a maximum borrowing commitment of million consisting of an million day revolving credit facility  or tranche a  and a five year million revolving credit facility  or tranche b 
at december   million in total was outstanding on this facility 
the revolving credit facility bears interest at certain spreads over the eurodollar rate  or the greater of the federal funds rate or the agent bank s prime rate 
we have the option to determine which rate will be used 
we also pay a facility fee on the commitment 
the interest rate spreads and facility fee are adjusted based on our debt to capitalization ratio and range from 
to 
at december   the interest rate payable on the facility was 
we are required to maintain a total debt to capitalization ratio of not more than through december  and of not more than thereafter  and a senior debt to capitalization ratio of not more than through december  and of not more than thereafter 
the agreement also requires a ratio of ebitda  excluding certain non recurring items  to interest and dividends on preferred stock as of the end of any fiscal quarter  for the four preceding fiscal quarters  of not less than to and increasing to to by december  this facility is guaranteed and secured via a pledge of the stock of certain of our subsidiaries 
we generally utilize excess daily funds to reduce any outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility and associated interest expense  and we intend to continue such practice 
master shelf agreement 
in december  we entered into a master shelf agreement with the prudential insurance company of america 
amounts outstanding under the master shelf agreement at december  are as indicated in the following table dollars in thousands interest final issue date amount rate maturity principal payments due october   october   on each of october  through december   december  single payment at maturity october   october  single payment at maturity october   october  single payment at maturity july   july   on each of july  through in april  effective january  we amended our agreement with prudential to reflect the following provisions 
we are required to maintain a current ratio  as defined therein  of at least 
to  a minimum tangible net worth equal to the sum of million plus of consolidated net earnings earned from january  plus of the net proceeds of any equity offerings after january   a total debt to capitalization ratio of not more than through december  and of not more than thereafter and a senior debt to capitalization ratio of through march and thereafter 
this amendment also requires an ebitda to interest ratio of not less than to increasing to a ratio of not less than to by march  and an ebitda to interest on senior debt ratio of not less than to increasing to a ratio of not less than to by march  ebitda in these calculations excludes certain non recurring items 
in addition  we are prohibited from declaring or paying dividends that in the aggregate exceed the sum of million plus of consolidated net income earned after june   or minus of a net loss  plus the aggregate net cash proceeds received after june  from the sale of any stock 
at december   approximately million was available under this limitation 
we financed the million scheduled payment made in october with amounts available under the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the master shelf agreement are guaranteed and secured via a pledge of the stock of certain of our subsidiaries 
in june  we prepaid approximately million of notes outstanding under the master shelf agreement with proceeds from the offering of the subordinated notes 
senior notes 
in  we sold million of senior notes  the senior notes  to a group of insurance companies with an interest rate of per annum 
in march  we prepaid million of the principal amount outstanding on the senior notes at par 
these payments were financed by a portion of the million bridge loan described below and by amounts available under the revolving credit facility 
the remaining principal amount outstanding of million is due in a single payment in december the senior notes are guaranteed and secured via a pledge of the stock of certain of our subsidiaries 
this facility contains covenants similar to the master shelf agreement 
in the second quarter of and in january  we posted letters of credit for a total of approximately million for the benefit of the holders of the senior notes 
we are currently paying an annual fee of not more than 
on the amounts outstanding on the master shelf agreement and the senior notes 
this fee will continue until we have received an implied investment grade rating on our senior secured debt 
this fee is not assessed on the portion of the senior notes for which letters of credit are posted 
senior notes 
in  we sold million of senior notes  the senior notes  to a group of insurance companies 
scheduled annual principal payments of million on the senior notes were made on april of and in february  we prepaid million of the total principal amounts outstanding of million at par 
these payments were financed by a portion of the million bridge loan 
we prepaid the remaining outstanding principal of million in april with amounts available under the revolving credit facility 
in connection with the repayments on the master shelf agreement  the senior notes and the senior notes  we incurred approximately million of pre tax yield maintenance and other charges 
these charges are reflected as an extraordinary loss from early extinguishment of long term debt in the second quarter of bridge loan 
in february  in order to finance prepayments of amounts outstanding on the and senior notes  we entered into a bridge loan agreement in the amount of million with our agent bank 
this facility was paid in full in april with proceeds from the sale of the katy facility 
senior subordinated notes 
in june  we sold million of senior subordinated notes in a private placement with a final maturity of due in a single payment 
the subordinated notes bear interest at and were priced at to yield 
these notes contain maintenance covenants which include limitations on debt incurrence  restricted payments  liens and sales of assets 
the subordinated notes are unsecured and are guaranteed on a subordinated basis by certain of our subsidiaries 
in november  we exchanged the privately placed notes for registered publicly tradable notes under the same terms and conditions 
we incurred approximately million in offering commissions and expenses which have been capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the notes 
covenant compliance 
the company was in compliance with all covenants in its debt agreements at december  taking into account all the covenants contained in these agreements  we had approximately million of available borrowing capacity at december  in the second quarter of  we amended our various financing facilities providing for financial flexibility and covenant modifications and issued the subordinated notes 
these amendments were needed given the depressed commodity pricing experienced in the industry in general at that time and the disappointing results at our bethel treating facility 
we can provide no assurance that further amendments or waivers can be obtained in the future  if necessary  or that the terms would be favorable to us 
to strengthen our credit ratings and to reduce our overall debt outstanding  we will continue to dispose of non strategic assets and investigate alternative financing sources including the issuance of public debt  project financing  joint ventures and operating leases 
risk management activities our commodity price risk management program has two primary objectives 
the first goal is to preserve and enhance the value of our equity volumes of gas and ngls with regard to the impact of commodity price movements on cash flow  net income and earnings per share in relation to those anticipated by our operating budget 
the second goal is to manage price risk related to our gas  crude oil and ngl marketing activities to protect profit margins 
this risk relates to hedging fixed price purchase and sale commitments  preserving the value of storage inventories  reducing exposure to physical market price volatility and providing risk management services to a variety of customers 
we utilize a combination of fixed price forward contracts  exchange traded futures and options  as well as fixed index swaps  basis swaps and options traded in the over the counter  or otc  market to accomplish these objectives 
these instruments allow us to preserve value and protect margins because corresponding losses or gains in the value of the financial instruments offset gains or losses in the physical market 
we use futures  swaps and options to reduce price risk and basis risk 
basis is the difference in price between the physical commodity being hedged and the price of the futures contract used for hedging 
basis risk is the risk that an adverse change in the futures market will not be completely offset by an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the commodity being hedged 
basis risk exists in natural gas primarily due to the geographic price differentials between cash market locations and futures contract delivery locations 
we enter into futures transactions on the new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  and the kansas city board of trade and through otc swaps and options with various counterparties  consisting primarily of financial institutions and other natural gas companies 
we conduct our standard credit review of otc counterparties and have agreements with these parties that contain collateral requirements 
we generally use standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
otc exposure is marked to market daily for the credit review process 
our otc credit risk exposure is partially limited by our ability to require a margin deposit from our major counterparties based upon the mark to market value of their net exposure 
we are subject to margin deposit requirements under these same agreements 
in addition  we are subject to similar margin deposit requirements for our nymex counterparties related to our net exposures 
the use of financial instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when i equity volumes are less than expected  ii our customers fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas or ngls  or iii our otc counterparties fail to perform 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  we are similarly insulated against decreases in these prices 
we hedged a portion of our estimated equity volumes of gas and ngls in at pricing levels approximating our operating budget 
our equity hedging strategy establishes a minimum price while allowing varying levels of market participation above the minimum 
as of february   we had hedged approximately  or  mmbtu day  of our anticipated equity gas for at a weighted average nymex equivalent minimum price of per mmbtu and an additional  or  mmbtu day  with collars with a minimum price of per mmbtu and a maximum price of per mmbtu nymex equivalent price 
additionally  we have hedged approximately  or  bbl per month of our anticipated equity natural gasoline  condensate and crude oil for using a collar with a minimum price of per bbl and maximum price of per bbl nymex crude oil monthly average price 
we have also hedged approximately  or  bbl per month  of our anticipated equity production of ngls for with a minimum weighted average mt 
belvieu composite price of per gallon 
finally  we have hedged approximately  or  bbls of our estimated first quarter production of equity ngls at a weighted average mt 
belvieu price of per gallon 
at december   we had  of unrecognized gains in inventory that will be recognized primarily during the first quarter of which may be offset by margins from our related forward fixed price hedges and physical sales 
at december   we had unrecognized net losses of  related to financial instruments that are expected to be offset by corresponding unrecognized net gains from our obligations to sell physical quantities of gas and ngls 
we enter into speculative futures  swap and option trades on a very limited basis for purposes that include testing of hedging techniques 
our policies contain strict guidelines for these trades including predetermined stop loss requirements and net open position limits 
speculative futures  swap and option positions are marked to market at the end of each accounting period and any gain or loss is recognized in income for that period 
net gains or losses from these speculative activities for the years ended december  and were not material 
natural gas derivative market risk as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately bcf of natural gas futures  swaps and options extending from january to january with a weighted average duration of approximately three months 
this was comprised of approximately bcf of long positions and bcf of short positions in such instruments 
as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately bcf of natural gas futures  swaps and options extending from january to december with a weighted average duration of approximately four months 
this was comprised of approximately bcf of long positions and bcf of short positions in such instruments 
we use a value at risk var model designed by jp morgan as one measure of market risk for our natural gas portfolio 
the var calculated by this model represents the maximum change in market value over the holding period at the specified statistical confidence interval 
the var model is generally based upon jp morgan s riskmetrics tm methodology using historical price data to derive estimates of volatility and correlation for estimating the contribution of tenor and location risk 
the var model assumes a one day holding period and uses a confidence level 
as of december   the calculated var of our entire natural gas portfolio of futures  swaps and options was approximately million 
this figure includes the risk related to our entire portfolio of natural gas financial instruments and does not include the related underlying hedged physical transactions 
all financial instruments for which there are no offsetting physical transactions are treated as either the hedge of an anticipated transaction or a speculative trade 
as of december   the var of these type of transactions for natural gas was approximately  crude oil and ngl derivative market risk as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately  mgal of ngl futures  swaps and options extending from january to december with a weighted average duration of approximately seven months 
this was comprised of approximately  mgal of long positions and  mgal of short positions in such instruments 
as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately  mgal of ngl futures  swaps and options extending from january to december with a weighted average duration of approximately six months 
this was comprised of approximately  mgal of long positions and  mgal of short positions in such instruments 
as of december   we had purchased  barrels per month of nymex monthly average settlement per barrel puts and sold  barrels per month of nymex monthly average settlement calls to hedge a portion of the company s equity production of natural gasoline  condensates and crude oil 
we do not hold any crude oil futures  swaps or options for settlement beyond as of december   we had purchased  barrels per month of opis mt 
belvieu monthly average settlement per gallon puts to hedge a portion of our equity production of propane for as of december   we had purchased  barrels per month of opis mt 
belvieu monthly average settlement per gallon of purity ethane puts to hedge a portion of our equity production of ethane for as of december   we did not hold any ngl futures  swaps or options for settlement beyond as of december   the estimated fair value of the aforementioned crude oil and ngl options held by us was approximately 
foreign currency derivative market risk as a normal part of our business  we enter into physical gas transactions which are payable in canadian dollars 
we enter into forward purchases and sales of canadian dollars from time to time to fix the cost of our future canadian dollar denominated natural gas purchase  sale  storage and transportation obligations 
this is done to protect marketing margins from adverse changes in the us and canadian dollar exchange rate between the time the commitment for the payment obligation is made and the actual payment date of such obligation 
as of december   the net notional value of such contracts was approximately million in canadian dollars  which approximates its fair market value 
as of december   the net notional value of such contracts was approximately million in canadian dollars  which approximated its fair market value 
year overall  we did not experience any significant disruption of our operations or computer systems as a result of the year issue 
prior to december   we completed a comprehensive review of our computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and developed and implemented a plan to mitigate the risk of any problems 
our remediation plan included i creating a year awareness program to educate employees  ii compiling an inventory of all systems  iii developing system test plans as appropriate  iv completing the testing and remediation as required for both information and non information technology systems  and v developing contingency plans to minimize the impact of a year related failure caused either internally or externally 
additionally  we surveyed our business counterparties periodically regarding their year conversion and contingency plans 
in total  we spent approximately million for remediation purposes  which primarily consisted of purchasing hardware and software upgrades 
we also incurred internal staff costs and other expenses  which were immaterial 
environmental the construction and operation of our gathering systems  plants and other facilities used for the gathering  transporting  processing  treating or storing of gas and ngls are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those that can impose obligations to clean up hazardous substances at our facilities or at facilities to which we send wastes for disposal 
in most instances  the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control or waste management 
we employ four environmental engineers  five safety specialists and three regulatory compliance specialists to monitor environmental and safety compliance at our facilities 
prior to consummating any major acquisition  our environmental engineers perform audits on the facilities to be acquired 
in addition  on an ongoing basis  the environmental engineers perform environmental assessments of our existing facilities 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental laws and regulations 
environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning  designing  constructing and operating our facilities 
we believe that the costs for compliance with current environmental laws and regulations have not had and will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the texas natural resource conservation commission which has authority to regulate  among other things  stationary air emissions sources  has created a committee to make recommendations to the commission regarding a voluntary emissions reduction plan for the permitting of existing grandfathered air emissions sources within the state of texas 
a grandfathered air emissions source is one that does not need a state operating permit because it was constructed prior to we operate a number of these sources within the state of texas  including portions of our midkiff plant and many of our compressors 
the recommendations proposed by the committee would create a voluntary permitting program for grandfathered sources  including incentives to participate  like the ability to operate these sources in a flexible manner 
it is not clear which of the committee s recommendations  if any  that the commission will implement and it is not possible to assess the potential effect on us until final regulations are promulgated 
we anticipate that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue to be towards stricter standards 
we are unaware of future environmental standards that are reasonably likely to be adopted that will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations  but we cannot rule out that possibility 
we are in the process of voluntarily cleaning up substances at certain facilities that we operate 
our expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation at existing facilities have not been significant in relation to our results of operations and totaled approximately million for the year ended december   including approximately  in air emissions fees to the states in which we operate 
although we anticipate that such environmental expenses per facility will increase over time  we do not believe that such increases will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations
