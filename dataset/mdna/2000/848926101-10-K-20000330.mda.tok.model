the march supply contract  which has a five year term  is valued at approximately million 
on march   the company closed the acquisition the coating maine acquisition of certain assets from warren through its newly formed subsidiary  coating maine 
coating maine utilizes the acquired assets at a portion of warren s paper mill near portland  maine to manufacture pressure sensitive adhesive backed label stock 
coating maine manufactures and markets standard  high volume  pressure sensitive products primarily for the edp segment of the label stock market  which complements spinnaker coating s custom  low volume  pressure sensitive products used for specialty applications 
coating maine s products are used in various labeling end uses  including form printing and product marking and identification 
the company also manufactures and markets industrial process equipment and air pollution control scrubbers through its entoleter subsidiary 
the company is exploring strategic alternatives with respect to entoleter to improve shareholder value  including a possible split off 
there can be no assurance  however  that any transaction involving entoleter will occur 
adhesive backed label stock the company develops  manufactures and markets adhesive backed label stock that is converted by printers and industrial users into products that are utilized for marking  identifying  labeling and decorating applications and products 
during  the company s adhesive backed label stock products were offered in three primary adhesive categories pressure sensitive  water sensitive and heat sensitive 
pressure sensitive products constituted approximately of the company s net sales of adhesive backed label stock products  while water sensitive products constituted approximately and heat sensitive products constituted approximately of such sales 
pressure sensitive 
pressure sensitive adhesive backed label stock products  which are activated by the application of pressure  are manufactured with a three element construction consisting of face stock  adhesive coating and silicone coated release liner 
the adhesive product is sold in roll or sheet form for further conversion into products used primarily for marking  identification and promotional labeling

sheet pressure sensitive products are sold to commercial sheet printers  who provide information labels and other products such as laser printer stock 
water sensitive 
water sensitive adhesive backed label stock products  which are activated by the application of water  include a broad range of paper and cloth materials  coated with a variety of adhesives 
the adhesive coated products are sold in roll or sheet form for further conversion to postage and promotional stamps  container labels  inventory control labels  shipping labels and splicing  binding and stripping tapes 
the water sensitive line is sold under the trade name pancake registered trademark and consists of three product groups dry process  conventional gummed and industrial 
dry process is sold primarily for label and business form uses 
conventional gum products serve many of the same end uses for hand applied labels as dry process stock 
a major portion of these products is sold for government postage and promotional stamp uses 
industrial products are sold in several niche markets  such as electrical and other specialty markets 
during  the company entered into an alliance with ivex packaging corporation ivex under which the company assumes full responsibility for all sales and marketing of ivex s dry gum products and ivex agreed to accept orders for  and to manufacture  the company s dry gum and water activated products 
as compensation  the company receives a commission on all such sales 
heat sensitive 
heat sensitive adhesive backed label stock products  which are activated by the application of heat  are manufactured by coating a face stock with either a hot melt coating or an emulsion process adhesive 
the heat sensitive product line is sold primarily for labeling end uses  such as pharmaceutical bottles  meat and cheese packages  supermarket scales  cassettes and bakery packages 
the adhesive coated product is sold in roll or sheet form for further conversion 
the company s heat sensitive products are sold under the trade name heat seal registered trademark 
industrial process equipment business entoleter engineers  manufactures and markets a vertically integrated line of size reduction equipment complemented by a line of air pollution control equipment 
entoleter s products primarily consist of i centrimil milling equipment for particle size reduction  ii granulators for the plastics molding industry and precision cutters for the film and non woven industry  and iii centrifield scrubbers for the removal of impurities from air  gases and liquids  and for heat recovery  gas absorption  and other mass transfer functions 
the company is exploring strategic alternatives with respect to entoleter to improve shareholder value  including a possible split off 
there can be no assurance  however  that any transaction involving entoleter will occur 
marketing and customers the company s marketing strategy focuses not only on products  but also customer service and specific customer applications 
the company has conducted business with its top ten customers for approximately nineteen years on the average 
the company s relationships with customers focus on customer service and its ability to research and develop custom solutions for unique end user applications 
the company s marketing and customer service provides the company with new growth opportunities to increase market share 
the company believes that the breadth of its product line  commitment to product quality and reputation for innovation will enable it to increase its market share through the introduction of new products 
the company markets its broad range of products to a variety of customers 
during  us paper corporation of america accounted for approximately of the company s net sales 
the company markets its adhesive backed label stock products through its own sales representatives to regional and national printers  converters and merchants 
the majority of sales represent product sold and shipped from the company s facilities in troy  ohio and westbrook  maine 
however  to broaden its market penetration  the company also contracts with regional processors throughout the united states  with whom it stores product until sold 
generally  these processors perform both slitting and distribution services for the company 
manufacturing and raw materials the company offers its adhesive label stock products in three primary categories pressure sensitive  water sensitive and heat sensitive 
the company manufactures its adhesive back label stock products at two plants in troy  ohio and the recently acquired facility in westbrook  maine 
the company has made approximately million in capital expenditures over the past four years at the ohio facilities  including million for the addition of a new production line for silicone coating 
during  before the addition of the new production line  the company outsourced a portion of its silicone coated liner requirements 
raw materials are the most significant cost component in the company s production process 
the material component accounts for approximately to of the total cost of its products  with the most important raw materials being paper gumming kraft and face stock  adhesive materials  fiberglass  and polypropylene resin 
these materials are currently readily available and are procured from numerous suppliers 
competition the adhesive backed materials industry is fragmented and highly competitive 
the company competes with several national manufacturers  including avery dennison and bemis  as well as a number of importers and smaller regional manufacturers 
as a result of the competitive environment in the markets in which the company operates  the company faces and will continue to face pressure on sales prices of its products 
for this reason  the company continues to invest resources to improve operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs 
however  as a result of such pricing pressures  the company may in the future experience reductions in the profit margins on its sales  or may be unable to pass future raw material price increases to its customers which would also reduce profit margins 
environmental regulations the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations governing emissions to the air  discharges to waterways  and generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
the company is also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters 
environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to predict the effect that these laws and regulations will have on the company in the future 
the company periodically conducts evaluations of its environmental compliance and while the company believes it is currently in substantial compliance with all such environmental laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that it will at all times be in complete compliance with all such requirements 
in addition  the company believes that any noncompliance is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has made and will continue to make capital expenditures to comply with environmental requirements 
as is the case with manufacturers in general  if a release of hazardous substances occurs on or from the company s properties or any associated offsite disposal location  or if contamination from prior activities is discovered at any of the company s properties  the company may be held liable and the amount of such liability could be material 
patents and trademarks patents are held by the company with respect to the manufacture of certain of its products  but management does not consider such patents to be important to the company s operations 
the patents expire over various lengths of time with the last patent expiring in about years 
the company has registered several of its trade names and trademarks for adhesive backed materials 
the company does not believe that its use of trademarks or trade names infringes on the rights of any third parties 
international sales the company s foreign sales were approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
of the million in foreign sales  approximately were represented by exports of adhesive backed materials from spinnaker coating 
the substantial majority of these sales were to canadian customers and  consequently  the company believes that the risks commonly associated with doing business in foreign countries are minimal 
the profitability of foreign sales is substantially equivalent to that of domestic sales 
because foreign sales are transacted in united states dollars  payments in many cases are secured by irrevocable letters of credit 
litigation the company from time to time is involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business operations  such as employment matters  contractual disputes and personal injury claims 
there are no proceedings currently pending for which the company s potential liability would be material to its financial condition or operations 
employees as of december   the company employed approximately persons  of whom were spinnaker coating employees and were entoleter employees 
the remaining employees were employed directly by the company 
all employees other than management are paid on an hourly basis 
the majority of spinnaker coating s hourly employees are not represented by unions  however  its troy  ohio plants are currently undergoing an organization attempt by the paper  allied industrial  chemical and energy workers international union afl cio pace to introduce a union at these facilities 
an election is scheduled for march  spinnaker coating s westbrook  maine facility has a labor agreement with pace covering approximately employees  which expires in entoleter s approximately hourly production employees are members of the united electrical  radio and machine workers of america union 
the current collective bargaining agreement expires in the company believes that its relations with its employees are good  however  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience work stoppages or slowdowns in the future

see notes to consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation for additional information concerning the registrant s financial performance 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation historical the company has been one of the leading manufacturers and marketers of adhesive backed materials  primarily for the pressure sensitive label stock and industrial tape markets  for the past several years 
in the third quarter of  the company completed the sale of its two industrial tape units  central products and spinnaker electrical  which together comprised its industrial tape segment 
see disposition of industrial tape segment 
central products branded and private label carton sealing tape products were used primarily for commercial packaging applications  including the packaging of goods for shipment by manufacturing  retail and distribution companies  and were sold through its national sales force to over  paper and office products distributors nationwide 
spinnaker electrical manufactured and marketed pressure sensitive industrial electrical tapes used for insulation in the production of motors  coils and transformers 
spinnaker electrical sold domestically through its own sales organization and into eastern europe through a relationship with the world s largest distributor of electrical products 
spinnaker coating  which represents the company s adhesive backed label stock segment  offers a full line of more than  variations of label stock and sells its products in roll or sheet form to over  printers  paper merchants and industrial users  who convert the label stock into labels used for a broad range of end use applications  including bar coding  mailing and shipping  packaging for pharmaceutical  food and other consumer products  office identification and business forms  postage stamp stock  decorative labels and other specialty industrial uses 
the company also manufactures and markets industrial process equipment and air pollution control scrubbers through entoleter 
since june  the company has experienced rapid growth  which has been accomplished through the company s acquisition of its industrial tape and adhesive backed label stock manufacturing operations and the company s subsequent internal growth 
the internal growth is a result of the company s implementation of its core competencies to the operations  including refocused sales and marketing strategy and additional capital investment at all subsidiaries 
from through  the company averaged approximately million per year in capital expenditures to improve manufacturing efficiencies  which lowered manufacturing costs and improved production efficiencies  while simultaneously increasing production capacity 
the investments included an expansion in coating capacity for label stock production  which lowered manufacturing costs  and enhancements in its film line and coating lines  which increased tape production capacity and efficiency enabling the company to transition from a seven day to a five day work week at its brighton manufacturing facility 
with the acquisition of spinnaker coating in  the company entered the adhesive backed materials industry 
the central products acquisition in provided the company with a leading position in the carton sealing tape market of the adhesive backed materials industry 
as a result of the foregoing acquisitions  the company became a manufacturer of the broadest line of adhesive backed label stock and carton sealing tape products in the adhesive backed materials industry 
the coating maine acquisition and the electrical tape acquisition were intended to further strengthen the company s position in the adhesive backed materials market 
the company believes the combination of coating maine with spinnaker coating s adhesive backed label stock business makes the company the fifth largest producer of label stock and the second largest manufacturer of edp label stock 
subsequent to each of the foregoing acquisitions  the company implemented cost reduction measures  including more effective management  rationalization of raw materials and component purchasing  improved materials flow and improved management information systems 
the company believes such measures contributed to improved operating profits at the company s carton sealing tape and label stock manufacturing operations in  and softened the impact of heightened market competition and asian imports during the company has historically operated at a high level of capacity utilization and has increased capacity of the acquired plant facilities through operating efficiency improvements 
for example  early in central products completed the transition from a seven day to a five day workweek at its brighton  colorado facility 
the capital investments over the past twelve to eighteen months improved manufacturing efficiencies to a point that enabled the company to meet current production requirements with fewer man hours  thereby saving approximately to million on an annual basis through the elimination of approximately fifty manufacturing personnel 
another example is the silicone coating production line at spinnaker coating 
in order to meet production capacity requirements under the postage stamp stock agreements awarded to spinnaker coating in and  spinnaker coating invested approximately million to add a production line for silicone coating 
during  before the addition of the new production line  spinnaker coating outsourced a portion of its silicone coated liner requirement 
the company incurred higher costs of sales approximately million for the year ended december   as a result of such outsourcing 
the installation of the additional production line was completed by the end of the fourth quarter of and became fully operational in january  which enabled the company to meet its future silicone liner production requirements and eliminated the costs that were associated with outsourcing 
the cost of the company s principal raw materials  polypropylene resin and paper  have generally remained stable or declined over the past several years 
historically  any raw material cost increases have resulted in the company instituting higher prices  consistent with the increases instituted by its competitors  for its industrial tape and adhesive backed label stock products 
the increases in raw material costs for the company s products have not materially impacted the company s gross profit because the company has generally been able to pass along its raw material cost increases without negatively impacting sales of its products 
in  the company s principal raw material costs generally declined as a result of scale economies associated with the combined operations of spinnaker coating and coating maine  and established procurement programs 
the agreements under which the company s adhesive backed label stock products are sold generally do not contain adjustment mechanisms for fluctuations in the cost of raw materials 
however  the company has generally passed along raw material price changes for products sold under such agreements  as well as for products sold to other customers 
the exception to the foregoing is the company s supply agreement relating to pressure sensitive label stock used by the postal service  which provides for pre determined annual price increases 
the postal service agreement gives the company protection against limited price increases to the extent that increases in costs of raw materials are no more than the increases provided by such agreement 
in order to protect against raw material price increases that exceed the annual price increases under the postal service agreement  the company has entered into supply agreements with its raw material suppliers that have ceilings on future price increases 
the future impact of a change in raw material costs on the company s profitability is based in part on pricing by the company s competitors 
although historically the company has generally been able to pass through raw material cost fluctuations  the company cannot be assured that future raw material cost increases can be passed through to its customers or that such cost increases will not negatively impact the company s gross profit 
disposition of industrial tape segment on august  and july   the company completed the sale of its two industrial tape units  central products and spinnaker electrical  respectively  to intertape 
as a result  the company s industrial tape segment is reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements 
the industrial tape segment generated million and million of net sales for fiscal years ended december  and  respectively  and million of net sales in through the date of disposition 
general corporate office expenses related to finance and administrative functions including public company compliance reporting  bank and investor relations  taxes other than income taxes and holding company payroll  historically allocated and charged to the industrial tape segment were reversed and allocated back to continuing operations 
these expenses were not considered to be directly attributed to discontinued operations 
interest expense attributed to the senior notes and related deferred financing has historically been allocated based on the pro rata share of subsidiary debt obligations retired with the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes  to total debt obligations retired 
the senior note proceeds were used to extinguish certain outstanding term and revolver obligations in october interest expense from continuing operations is subject to certain matters associated with the use of the net proceeds from the sales of central products and spinnaker electrical  including retirement of senior debt or permitted investments as defined under the indenture 
as a result  interest expense  as presented on a historical basis  may not necessarily be indicative of interest expense of continuing operations for periods after december  results of continuing operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
the company s net sales were million  compared to million in the growth in net sales for is attributed to approximately million in net sales from the acquisition of coating maine and higher unit sales of certain label stocks from  which were offset by increased capacity in the domestic market and the disruption of business at entoleter from a mid summer labor dispute 
gross margins 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales in  net of a charge impacting comparability  was approximately compared to approximately in the gross margins were lower due to competitive pricing in the adhesive backed materials industry  the timing and new pricing of the current postage contract  development costs associated with a new multi ply pressure sensitive posting product offering  and unabsorbed overhead costs at entoleter attributed to the labor dispute 
the charge impacting comparability related to severance and termination benefits associated with the termination of indirect manufacturing personnel at spinnaker coating 
the first quarter charge totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was reflected in manufacturing burden and the balance in selling  general and administrative expense 
the impact of asian imports and new manufacturing capacity increased domestic market competition  and a product technology transition resulted in changes in sales mix which contributed to lower average selling prices in pressure sensitive label  leading to product substitution 
the current postage contract  a five year million agreement  was awarded late in the first quarter of and contained new pricing and product mix  which became effective immediately 
the company has offset a portion of these margin pressures by continuing to lower average unit manufacturing costs through manufacturing efficiency improvements  resulting from recent capital investments  updated material procurement policies and procedures  reductions in manufacturing and administrative personnel  and product substitution that parallel the market s balance of quality and performance versus lower pricing 
income from operations 
income from operations in  net of a charge impacting comparability  was approximately million compared to million in the operating results reflect lower gross margins and increased depreciation and amortization of approximately million associated with the coating maine acquisition  offset by lower selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
the company has continued to rationalize general and administrative overhead and has leveraged the knowledge within and between operating units  which has enabled it to reduce sg a costs 
interest expense 
interest expense for was approximately million  an increase of approximately million from the increase is due to the financing associated with the company s acquisition of coating maine and certain senior note interest expense  included in continuing operations  historically allocated to the industrial tape segment 
subsequent to the industrial tape sale  senior note interest expense in continuing operations increased as the company continues to evaluate all its alternatives and options related to the restricted proceeds 
income taxes 
the income tax benefit for federal and state income taxes is at an effective rate of l 
the annual effective tax rate varies from statutory rates primarily due to state income taxes 
a portion of the company s operating losses and available net operating loss carryforwards where utilized to fully offset the pre tax gain from the industrial tape sale 
the company has approximately million of remaining net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
these carryforwards begin to expire in the year  however  are anticipated to be utilized to offset extraordinary gains from the early extinguishment of debt realized in the march  quarter 
net income 
the company recorded net income of million  or per share for  compared to a net loss of million  or per share in the earnings include a gain of million from the sale of the industrial tape sale and an extraordinary gain of million from the early extinguishment of debt 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
the company s net sales were million  compared to million in the increase in net sales for is attributed to approximately million in sales from the acquisition of coating maine  in addition to increased unit sales of certain label stocks from levels 
these increases partially offset lower unit sales of pressure sensitive postage paper stock 
unit sales of pressure sensitive postage paper stock  which were impacted by the timing of orders by the bep earlier in the year  increased significantly during the last half of the year to near levels 
gross margins 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales in was approximately compared to approximately in the gross margins were lower due to competitive pricing in adhesive backed materials industry  and the timing and new pricing of postage paper stock business 
the timing of postage paper stock business contributed to marginally lower units and a new five year million contract for the supply of postage paper stock resulted in lower average selling prices in the company has offset a portion of the margin pressures by continuing to improve manufacturing efficiencies  lowering average unit manufacturing costs  personnel reductions  and introducing new cost efficient products that meet market demands 
the company attributes the improved manufacturing to efficiencies gained through reductions of manufacturing personnel  material process and handling modifications and recent capital investments which have enabled the company to increase output and reduce manufacturing downtime 
income from operations 
income from operations was approximately million  compared to million in the operating results reflect lower gross margins on increased net sales and lower sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales  offset by approximately million of increased depreciation and amortization expense associated with the acquisition of coating maine 
the acquisition increased net sales approximately million  however the company s sg a expenses excluding depreciation and amortization declined from approximately of net sales in to in the company has continued to rationalize administrative overhead and leverage the knowledge within and between the subsidiaries  which has enabled it to reduce selling and administrative costs 
interest expense 
interest expense for totaled approximately million  of which approximately million relates to amortization of deferred financing costs and payment in kind pik interest expense 
in  interest expense totaled approximately million  of which approximately million related to deferred financing costs 
the increase is primarily attributed to the financing associated with the company s acquisition of coating maine  and the increase in the spinnaker credit facility from million to million 
income taxes 
the income tax benefit for federal and state income taxes for continuing operations is at an effective rate of 
the company s tax rate is impacted by permanent tax differences and the write off of certain unrealizable deferred tax assets 
the company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to offset future taxable income 
these carryforwards begin to expire in the year net income 
the company recorded a net loss of million or per share  compared to a net loss of million or per share in liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the principal sources of liquidity for the company and its subsidiaries have historically been cash flow from operations  proceeds from the issuance of the company s senior notes and availability under the company s million revolving credit facility  which was decreased from million in connection with the industrial tape sale refinanced credit facility 
the company s cash used in operating activities for was million  compared to million of cash provided by operations in the cash generation is primarily attributed to the exclusion of substantially all trade payables in the coating maine acquisition and the implementation of improved cash management procedures 
these factors were the basis for the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in in comparison to the current year   and the prior year  restricted proceeds from the sale of central products satisfied transaction costs and repaid approximately million of the working capital revolver debt at the consummation of the central products sale 
the remaining restricted proceeds are available to prepay indebtedness other than subordinated debt of the company  invest in any business  capital expenditure or other tangible asset in the permitted businesses  as defined in the indenture 
any restricted proceeds not so invested within days after the closing of the industrial tape sale or not so used are deemed to be excess proceeds and shall be used to repurchase senior notes on a pro rata basis as required by the indenture 
proceeds from the sale of the assets of spinnaker electrical  which are not restricted under the indenture  repaid approximately million of term debt and working capital revolver debt collateralized by the assets of spinnaker electrical 
the remaining net proceeds are available for general purposes  which may include purchasing additional senior notes in the open market 
other options include acquisitions  capital expenditures to support remaining subsidiaries  and or repurchase shares of spinnaker common stock 
since december   the company  utilizing restricted proceeds from the industrial tape sale  has purchased approximately million par value of outstanding senior notes on the open market at an average price of  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including million par value senior notes purchased by spinnaker electrical during the third and fourth quarter of under the terms of the indenture  the company is required to utilize approximately an additional million of restricted proceeds by may  end of day period  to permanently reduce or prepay indebtedness  or to invest the proceeds in a permitted business 
the company continues to evaluate all of its alternatives and options 
the senior note purchases to date have reduced the senior note outstanding borrowings to approximately million  which lowers its anticipated april  senior note interest payment to approximately million 
the company anticipates having sufficient availability under the refinanced credit facility based on its current operations 
the refinanced credit facility is available to fund acquisitions and support periodic fluctuations in working capital 
credit availability under the refinanced credit facility is subject to certain variables  such as inventory and receivables eligible to be included in the borrowing base 
the refinanced credit facility will expire october the company is charged an unused credit fee every month of per annum 
outstanding borrowings bear interest at variable rates related to the prime interest rate or libor 
at december   the effective interest rate in effect was approximately 
the funding for the coating maine acquisition was the company s initial borrowing under the refinanced credit facility with the exception of periodic working capital borrowings by entoleter 
as of march   aggregate availability under the refinanced credit facility was approximately million  of which approximately million was outstanding 
in  the company issued a promissory note warren note to warren in the original principal amount of million in connection with the coating maine acquisition 
the warren note bears interest at the rate of  and includes a payment in kind pik feature that allowed the company to pay the first year s interest payment by issuing an additional subordinated note under similar terms as the warren note 
the company may also issue such a pik note if at a future interest payment date a default or event of default exists  or would be caused by the payment of such interest in cash  under the refinanced credit facility 
payments of principal and interest are subject to restrictions contained in  and in any event are junior and subordinate in right of payment to  the payment of indebtedness outstanding under the refinanced credit facility and the company s senior notes 
the warren note matures on january   however  it can be prepaid earlier if certain conditions or events occur 
prepayments of the original principal are due in two installments on march  and on march   provided the company is not in default of covenants under the refinanced credit facility after giving effect for the payment 
the unpaid portion of the payment or portions of future payments will be deferred until the next august or march or the company could make such payment  subject to the same conditions described above 
although the unpaid principal outstanding after march  is considered due on demand  the payment of such amount will still remain restricted under the conditions described above 
the company did not have sufficient unused availability under the terms of the refinanced credit facility to allow the march  prepayment  nor does it anticipate having sufficient availability in the near term and has classified the debt as non current in the company s financial statements 
in any event  the warren note and remaining unpaid interest will mature on january  capital resources 
the company budgeted capital expenditures of approximately to million during  however  at december  the company had commitments for a minor portion of such capital expenditures 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient cash flow from operations and availability under the refinanced credit facility to fund its commitments for such capital expenditures at december   as well as the additional capital expenditures budgeted for other on may   spinnaker parent closed the sale of its denver  colorado  warehouse facility for approximately million  resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
under the terms of the refinanced credit facility  the net proceeds from the sale of the warehouse represent a temporary reduction in the refinanced credit facility and are available to fund anticipated capital expenditures 
in february  spinnaker coating terminated approximately indirect manufacturing personnel  which is estimated to eliminate approximately million of costs on an annual basis 
the first quarter charge for severance and termination benefits is approximately million 
year during  the company launched various initiatives intended to ensure that its information technology it and non it systems would function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter
