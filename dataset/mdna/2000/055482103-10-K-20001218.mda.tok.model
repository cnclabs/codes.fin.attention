item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s operations are primarily driven by the number of oil and natural gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of such wells  the number of well completions and the level of workover activity worldwide 
drilling activity  in turn  is largely dependent on the price of oil and natural gas 
this situation often leads to volatility in the company s revenues and profitability  especially in the united states and canada  where the company historically has generated in excess of of its revenues 
due to aging oilfields and lower cost sources of oil internationally  drilling activity in the united states has declined more than from its peak in record low drilling activity levels were experienced in  and again in early despite a recovery in the latter half of fiscal  the us average fiscal active rig count represented the lowest in history and was down from the previous fiscal year 
the recovery in us drilling continued in fiscal as the active us rig count averaged rigs  a increase over fiscal most of the increase occurred in the number of rigs drilling for gas  which increased over the previous fiscal year  while the average number of rigs drilling for oil increased 
this recovery has continued into fiscal due to exceptionally strong oil and natural gas prices 
drilling activity outside north america has historically been less volatile than domestic drilling activity 
due to low oil prices during most of the year  international drilling activity also reached record low levels during while canadian drilling activity began to recover during the latter part of fiscal  activity in most of the other international regions is not expected to significantly recover until at least the middle of fiscal active international drilling rigs excluding canada averaged rigs during fiscal  little changed from fiscal due primarily to the improvement in oil and natural gas prices  however  canadian drilling activity continued the recovery begun in late  averaging active drilling rigs during fiscal and up from the previous fiscal year 
acquisition on june   the company completed the acquisition of selected assets and subsidiaries of fracmaster ltd 
fracmaster  an oilfield services company based in calgary  alberta with operations in canada  the united states  russia and china 
the acquisition was completed for a total purchase price of million 
fracmaster generated worldwide revenue of million during its fiscal year ended december  the acquisition of fracmaster has primarily impacted the company s operations in canada and russia 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected key operating statistics reflecting industry rig count and the company s financial results year ended september rig count us international  revenue per rig in thousands revenue per employee in thousands percentage of gross profit to revenue percentage of research and engineering expense to revenue percentage of marketing expense to revenue percentage of general and administrative expense to revenue industry estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active rigs 
gross profit represents revenue less cost of sales and services 
revenue due primarily to increased north american drilling and workover activity  as well as benefits from the acquisition of fracmaster in june  the company s revenue for fiscal reached a record level of billion  an increase of over fiscal such revenues reflect a strong recovery over when  after six consecutive years of revenue growth  the company s revenue declined by 
each of the company s service lines pressure pumping  process and pipeline services  tubular services and specialty chemicals experienced revenue decreases in fiscal management expects the company s revenues in fiscal to increase by in excess of over  as the north american drilling market remains strong and the company has begun to see signs of an international recovery with several new contracts being awarded or pending 
operating income loss for the year ended september   the company s operating income was million  compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal the company s gross profit margins for fiscal increased to from in fiscal the margin improvement was primarily a result of increased north american drilling and workover activity  pricing improvement in the us and the impact of cost reduction programs implemented during these efficiencies are reflected in the increase in both revenue per rig and revenue per employee in fiscal partially offsetting the improved margins were increases in research and engineering  marketing and general and administrative expenses totaling million due primarily to higher accruals for incentive plans  which are based upon the company s earnings and stock price and from overhead resulting from the fracmaster acquisition 
each of these operating expenses  however  declined as a percentage of revenues 
the operating loss was primarily a result of the company recording a pretax unusual charge of million 
per diluted share after tax  comprised of million of severance costs  million of asset writedowns and million of other costs associated with the downturn in the oilfield services industry 
in addition  the operating loss included million for costs resulting from the acquisition of fracmaster  and additional severance costs and asset writedowns primarily associated with the company s international operations  all of which were included in cost of sales 
excluding these items  the operating income decline was primarily a result of the decline in north and latin american drilling and workover activity  and lower pricing 
research and engineering  marketing and general and administrative expenses in total decreased by million in compared to due to the implementation of three phases of cost reduction programs beginning in july  and a lower incentive provision during the year 
in addition to the writedown  the company also recorded a million 
per diluted share after tax unusual charge in to reflect employee severance  asset writedowns and other costs associated with the downturn in the industry which began during the later part of other interest expense in decreased by million compared to the previous year due to lower borrowings resulting from improved cash flow from operations  as well as proceeds from an equipment refinancing transaction and a private placement of common stock  both of which were completed in the company s first fiscal quarter see also capital resources and liquidity 
interest expense increased by million in compared to due primarily to additional borrowings to finance the company s stock repurchase program implemented in december the company had repurchased shares at a cost totaling million under this program as of september  and purchased an additional million near the end of fiscal management expects to continue its share repurchases during fiscal despite these share repurchases  interest expense is expected to continue to decrease in due to reduced outstanding borrowings as a result of continued strong cash flow from operations 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate has remained below the us statutory rate during each of the past three years primarily as a result of profitability in international jurisdictions where the statutory tax rate is below the us rate  the availability of certain nonrecurring tax benefits and the availability of tax benefits from the company s reorganization pursuant to its initial public offering in the effective tax rate decreased to in from in  following an increase from in us mexico pressure pumping segment the company s us mexico pressure pumping revenues in fiscal reached a record million  a increase over the increase is primarily due to increased drilling and workover activity  which increased and  respectively over the prior year  along with an improvement in us revenue per active rig 
this improvement occurred because independent oil companies  with whom the company has a strong market position  contributed most of the increase in us drilling activity and also from larger fracturing treatments 
also contributing to the increased us revenues in was an increase in prices of approximately  as the company implemented new price books in november and again in september the company s us mexico pressure pumping revenues declined by in compared to as a result of lower activity and pricing caused by the record low drilling levels 
the fiscal average active rig count  down from the previous year  was the lowest in recorded history 
workover activity in was also weak  down during the year 
excluding mexico  each of the company s us regions experienced revenue declines in  with the oil producing regions of texas and oklahoma being the most severely impacted 
in addition  pricing declined by approximately compared to the previous year 
revenue in the company s mexico operations increased as a result of a new contract and the expansion of operations in northeast mexico 
as a result of the price increases in fiscal and the expected continuation of strong drilling and workover activity levels  management believes that fiscal revenue generated by its us mexico pressure pumping operations will exceed that of fiscal by in excess of operating income for the company s us mexico pressure pumping operations was million in fiscal compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal the improvement was due primarily to increased drilling and workover business  better utilization of personnel and equipment as a result of cost reduction measures implemented in fiscal and better pricing 
on a year over year basis  pricing improved approximately as a result of the aforementioned price book increases implemented during november and again in september the operating loss in fiscal was primarily caused by deceased revenues resulting from the severe decline in drilling and workover activity and corresponding lower prices for the company s products and services as the market contracted 
international pressure pumping segment revenue for the company s international pressure pumping operations was million in fiscal  an increase of compared with the previous fiscal year 
this increase was due mostly to the addition of the former fracmaster operations in canada and russia and a increase in drilling activity in canada 
excluding canada  where revenues increased  fiscal international pressure pumping revenues increased despite average drilling activity being flat with the prior year levels 
increased revenues in the company s latin america region were mostly offset by the impact of continued weakness in drilling activity in other international areas  most significantly in the company s asia pacific operations 
as a result of new contracts and improving activity in selected locations  management expects each of its international regions to show revenue increases in fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for the company s international pressure pumping operations was million in fiscal  a decrease of compared to fiscal with the exception of its russia operations  each of the company s international regions experienced revenue declines during  with its canadian and latin american operations showing the largest declines 
the revenue declines were a result of lower drilling activity and pricing in each of these regions 
operating income for the company s international pressure pumping operations was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the improvement was primarily due to improved canadian business and a non recurring charge relating primarily to asset writedowns that reduced operating margins for the company s international pressure pumping operations by million in the third quarter of fiscal operating income in canada increased as a result of efficiencies gained through better equipment and personnel utilization throughout the year  and from having a full year of the former fracmaster operations 
these gains  however  were partially offset by lower pricing outside north america  margin decreases in the company s europe africa region due to reduced north sea activity where the company s operations have a relatively high fixed cost base  and shutdown costs incurred in closing a facility in germany in early additionally  the operating income margins for the company s middle east region were negatively impacted by startup costs incurred for delayed projects 
operating income in fiscal declined by million from the million generated by the company s international pressure pumping operations in fiscal such decrease was primarily a result of lower drilling activity and lower pricing in each of the company s international regions  combined with the million non recurring charge made in the third quarter of fiscal other services segment revenue for each of the company s other service lines  which consist of specialty chemicals  tubular services and process and pipeline services  increased in fiscal compared to the prior year due primarily to the recovery in drilling activity levels 
revenue for these service lines had declined in from after increasing in the previous two years 
the decrease was due primarily to drilling activity declines  which were mostly offset by expansions into new markets and these service lines greater concentration of revenues from nondrilling oilfield activities  which are not as greatly impacted by the decline in the active rig count 
operating income for these service lines declined to million of revenue in fiscal compared to million of revenue in operating income margins in the company s tubular services line suffered from the drop in drilling activity in the north sea as it was unable to make a corresponding reduction in its fixed cost base 
also contributing to the operating income decline were job delays and higher startup costs in the process and pipeline services group for new projects that began late in the fiscal year 
operating income in had declined from million of revenue in primarily as a result of startup costs incurred in expanding these service lines geographically which replaced revenues lost due to reduced drilling activity 
capital resources and liquidity net cash provided from operating activities for fiscal was million  an increase of million from the prior year  due primarily to higher profitability and non cash us tax expense due to loss carryforwards 
this was partially offset by increases in working capital  particularly accounts receivable and inventories  as a result of the rapid revenue growth in north america 
net cash provided from operating activities was million in  a decrease of million from  primarily as a result of the lower profitability 
in addition  the tax benefit from us operating losses was non cash due to the company s cumulative net operating loss position 
this was partially offset by the additional liquidation of working capital balances from the reduction in activity and the non cash portion of the unusual charge 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was million  compared to net cash used for investing activities in of million 
the increase is due primarily to proceeds received from a transaction involving the transfer of certain pumping service equipment assets in the first quarter of fiscal subsequent to the transfer of equipment  the company received million  which was used to repay outstanding bank debt 
the equipment is being used to provide services to the company for its customers for which the company is paying a service fee for a period of at least six  but not more than thirteen  years 
the transaction generated a deferred gain for book purposes of approximately million  which is carried in other long term liabilities  and is being amortized over a thirteen year period 
the taxable gain of million was completely offset with net operating loss carryforwards 
excluding this transaction  cash used for investing activities declined by million due to the curtailment of capital spending beginning in mid year and because s investing activities included the acquisition of fracmaster 
the capital spending related primarily to maintenance capital and us offshore and international expansion 
the increase in cash used for investing activities of million was due primarily to the acquisition of fracmaster in june for net cash consideration of million 
excluding this acquisition  investing activities in declined by million  primarily due to a curtailment of capital spending caused by the depressed business environment 
the capital spending related primarily to upgrades to the company s us fracturing fleet and expansion of the tomball manufacturing and research and development facility 
the capital spending related primarily to additional fracturing and coiled tubing capacity for the company s international growth initiatives  upgrades to the company s us pumping fleet and upgrades to the company s information systems 
projected capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to increase significantly from and are currently expected to be approximately million 
the capital program is expected to be used primarily for replacement and enhancement of us fracturing equipment and stimulation expansion internationally 
the actual amount of capital expenditures will be primarily dependent on the availability of external manufacturing capacity and is expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities and available credit facilities 
management believes cash flows from operating activities and available lines of credit  if necessary  will be sufficient to fund projected capital expenditures 
cash flows used for financing activities for fiscal was million  compared to cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal of million 
financing activities in fiscal included a private placement of million shares of common stock in october that generated proceeds of million  which was used to pay down outstanding debt 
in connection with the private placement  the company also entered into privately negotiated option agreements pursuant to which it repurchased an equivalent number of shares in april for a total of million 
in april  the company utilized proceeds of million from the exercise of outstanding warrants  combined with borrowings under existing credit facilities  to fund the repurchase 
a total of  warrants  at an exercise price of per share each warrant represented the right to purchase two shares  were exercised before their expiration date of april  the exercise of the warrants resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
in september  the company also repurchased  shares of its common stock at a cost of million under a share repurchase program initially approved by the company s board of directors in december the share repurchase program initially authorized purchases up to million and was subsequently increased to million in may and to million in september subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company has purchased an additional  shares of its common stock at a cost of million 
these financing activities  along with proceeds from the exercise of stock options and cash provided by operating and investing activities  allowed the company to reduce outstanding borrowings by million 
cash flows provided by financing activities in were million  compared to a usage of cash for financing activities in of million 
the proceeds from borrowings were used to fund the fracmaster acquisition and the company s capital spending program 
in  the company used million to purchase its common stock under a stock repurchase program approved by the company s board of directors in december due to reduced profitability and the resulting reduction in cash flows from operating activities  the company did not repurchase any of its common stock during management strives to maintain low cash balances while utilizing available credit facilities to meet the company s capital needs 
any excess cash generated has historically been used to pay down outstanding borrowings or fund the company s stock repurchase program 
the company has a committed  unsecured bank credit facility the bank credit facility which consists of a six year term loan of approximately million currently drawn in canadian dollars under a provision which is renewable annually at the option of the banks  which is repayable in quarterly installments that began in march  and a five year us million revolving facility available through june at september   borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facility totaled million  consisting solely of borrowings under the term loan 
principal reductions of term loans under the bank credit facility are due in aggregate annual installments of million and million in the years ending september  and  respectively 
in addition to the committed facility  the company had million in various unsecured  discretionary lines of credit at september   which expire at various dates in there are no requirements for commitment fees or compensating balances in connection with these lines of credit 
interest on borrowings is based on prevailing market rates 
at september   there was million in outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit 
the company s total interest bearing debt decreased to of its total capitalization at september   compared to at september   due to repayment of borrowings from cash flows from operations  the proceeds received from the equipment transfer  the private placement of common stock  warrant exercises and stock option exercises 
the bank credit facility includes various customary covenants and other provisions including the maintenance of certain profitability and solvency ratios and restrictions on dividend payments under certain circumstances  none of which materially restrict the company s activities 
management believes that the bank credit facility  combined with other discretionary credit facilities and cash flows from operations  provides the company with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage its routine operations  meet debt service obligations and fund projected capital expenditures 
if the discretionary lines of credit are not renewed  or if borrowings under these lines of credit otherwise become unavailable  the company expects to refinance this debt by arranging additional committed bank facilities or through other long term borrowing alternatives 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities
