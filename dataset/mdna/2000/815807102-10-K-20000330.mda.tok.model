we sell our licenses through our direct sales force  telesales  international distributors and business partners 
software revenue increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily the result of increased sales force productivity  resulting in increased unit shipments and greater market penetration into the ebusiness marketplace 
these increased unit shipments were due to continued demand for segue products from existing customers and due to first time buyers  the introduction of new and upgraded products  and increased market acceptance of the families of products including web application testing and load testing products 
international product sales accounted for and of total segue s product sales in and  respectively 
the slightly decreased international sales were primarily due to the shifting of sales strategy from distributor to direct sales 
total e commerce software revenue represented and of total software revenue in and  respectively 
segue client server products  our historical core product line  represented and of the total software revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in e commerce software revenue from year to year was due to our increased focus on the e commerce testing market and the introduction of our new and enhanced silk family products such as silkmonitor  silkobserver and silkpilot 
the rate of continued software revenue growth depends upon our ability to successfully generate and fill current software license orders  attract and retain skilled personnel and deliver timely new products and enhancements 
performance could also be affected by the market acceptance of our new products silkpilot  silkmeter and silkobserver 
services revenue services revenue consists of revenue from maintenance  training and consulting 
services revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in service revenue is a result of the growth in our installed customer base and the increased training and consulting services performed for those customers 
maintenance revenue increased to million in compared to million in training and consulting revenue increased to million in compared to million in the moderate increase in training and consulting revenue is primarily due to fact that we completed more year related projects during as compared to the increase in recognized maintenance revenue was driven largely by incremental additional software licenses sold over the past months 
cost of software cost of software includes documentation  product packaging  product media  employment costs for processing and distribution  amortization of capitalized technology and royalties due to third parties 
these costs decreased to million  or of software revenue  in compared to million  or of software revenue  in the amortization of the completed technology included in cost of software for and was  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of software is partly due to the non recurring charge of  to write off of an nre fee and prepaid royalties 
there were no similar charges in see discussion of compared to below 
in addition  cost of software is lower in as a result of segue s continuing effort to increase sales of non royalty bearing products and eliminate sales of royalty bearing products 
in december  we entered into a five year agreement with a vendor which provides for future royalty payments to the vendor of of net revenues achieved on sales of segue products to the vendor s customer base 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid a guaranteed  non refundable minimum royalty of  in december as of december   other current assets included approximately  and other long term assets included approximately  related to the guaranteed royalties 
future royalty expense will be recognized as cost of software based upon qualified sales of the segue s products 
to the extent that revenue from related products does not support the guaranteed royalties described above  we could be required to accelerate amortization of these prepaid royalties 
the amortization of the prepaid royalties may cause the cost of software to increase as a percentage of revenue in the future 
cost of services cost of services consists principally of salaries and benefits for our customer technical support staff  which provides services under maintenance contracts  and for our training and consulting staff  as well as third party consulting fees and the cost of materials and facilities used in training customers 
cost of services increased to million  or of services revenue  in compared to million  or of services revenue  in the increase in cost of services is primarily due to our utilization of third party consultants to assist in testing solution implementations 
the cost of third party consultants is generally higher than the cost of internal resources 
the increases in amount and as a percentage of service revenue are also the result of start up costs incurred in the first six months of associated with the staffing and training for our northern ireland technical support center  which began operations in july  as well as the operating expenses of this support center during headcount in the training and consulting and technical support groups increased from december  to december  we expect to continue to hire employees in the services group in order to generate and support worldwide services revenue and to provide ongoing quality customer support to our increasing installed base of customers 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions  travel costs and promotional marketing programs 
marketing programs include advertising  direct mail programs  seminars and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of total revenue  in compared to million  or of total revenue  in the principal reasons for the absolute dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses were increased headcount  increases in commissions as a result of higher revenue levels  higher commission rates used in commission plans and increases in related travel costs 
segue expects to continue the growth of its worldwide sales and marketing organization during the continued growth depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and sales personnel 
there can be no assurance that related increased expenditures would result in increased revenue or improvement in the effectiveness of our sales organization 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and facility costs 
to date  all of segue s internal costs for research and development have been charged to operations as incurred since amounts of software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of total revenue  in compared to million  or of total revenue  in the increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses is mainly attributable to the increased headcount 
segue intends to continue to make significant investments in research and development to develop new products and to expand the capabilities of its web application testing products 
during  segue introduced several new products  including silkmonitor  which provides monitoring and reporting of web  application and database servers  silkpilot  a corba based distributed object testing product  and silkobserver which provides object monitoring and diagnostic capabilities for ebusiness applications 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for executive  finance  information technology  human resource and administrative personnel  professional fees  system support costs and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of total revenue  in compared to million  or of total revenue  in the increase in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses is partly attributable to increased headcount and related bonuses  increased facility costs for our new office location in lexington  massachusetts from august and increased consulting  legal and accounting expenses 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in to support our expanding business 
amortization of goodwill goodwill results from segue s acquisition of sqlbench in december and is being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
in  amortization expenses remained the same as in at million  which represents of total revenue in  as compared to in non recurring and other charges during the second quarter of  we restructured our product development operations and delayed the introduction of the eventus product  silkcontrol 
these activities were aimed at reducing our costs associated with the development of that product and enhancing our sales force s ability to focus on other products 
the restructuring resulted in the consolidation of four development labs into three and included the termination of fifteen employees associated with the development of the eventus product 
additionally  during the second quarter of we shifted our sales strategy away from creating and managing a large network of resellers towards building deeper relationships with a few large system integrators 
this revised strategy resulted in the termination of seven employees who focused sales efforts on these channel resellers 
we also terminated the employment of two senior vice presidents during the second quarter of  each of whom has subsequently been replaced 
associated with all the events noted above  segue recorded during the second quarter of non recurring and other charges of approximately million  of which million relates exclusively to severance and other employee related costs associated with a restructuring  and  including a noncash compensation charge of approximately  which relates to severance of two senior vice presidents 
as of december   we had made payments of approximately  related to the restructuring costs  and the related restructuring accrual balance was approximately  during the first quarter of  we executed a restructuring plan to consolidate our marketing  product development and administrative operations in order to achieve cost efficiencies through the elimination of redundant functions 
we realigned our marketing and product development operations to redirect our focus to our strongest product lines and better integrate the efforts of our product development teams 
as a result  segue recognized a non recurring charge of approximately million during the first quarter of this restructuring charge included approximately  for severance and other employee related costs for the termination of ten employees and approximately  for facility related costs  including the accrual of estimated lease obligations associated with the closure of excess office facilities 
as of december   we had made payments of approximately  related to these costs  and the related restructuring accrual balance was approximately  at the time of the restructuring action  we expected to realize a reduction in recurring costs of approximately million annually as a result of the restructuring action 
however  there can be no assurance that these benefits will be realized 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million related to the eventus and b w acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this charge consisted primarily of investment banking  legal  accounting and other professional fees and related costs 
other income expense interest income from cash  cash equivalents and short term investments amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income is related to the decrease in the average amount of invested funds 
interest expense amounted to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provision for income taxes segue recorded a provision for foreign and state income taxes of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there was no tax benefit for losses generated in the us during and due to the uncertainty of realizing such benefits 
management has evaluated the positive and negative evidence impacting the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
based on the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  and accordingly the deferred tax assets have been fully reserved 
management re evaluates the positive and negative evidence on a quarterly basis 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  software revenue software revenue increased to million in compared to million in the increase is primarily the result of increased unit shipments  particularly resulting from the direct domestic sales force 
these increased unit shipments were due to continued demand for products from existing customers and due to first time buyers  the introduction of new and upgraded products  increased market acceptance of the families of products including web application testing and load testing products introduced in and the expansion of our worldwide direct sales force 
international product sales accounted for and of total product sales in and  respectively  and increased for the factors noted above 
our mix of software revenue changed from to total e commerce software revenue represented and of total software revenue in and  respectively 
our client server products  our historical core product line  represented and of total software revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in e commerce software revenue was due to the introduction in may and september  respectively  of silktest and silkperformer  which target the e commerce testing markets 
the silk product family in total represented and of total software revenue in and  respectively 
during  eventus intentionally curtailed selling certain of its royalty bearing products which targeted the e commerce testing market in order to concentrate its efforts on developing and selling new products 
consequently  e commerce software revenue in consisted primarily of the silk product family 
qa performer and silkperformer which target the load testing markets  in total represented and of total software revenue in and  respectively 
the rate of continued software revenue growth depends upon our ability to successfully generate and fill current software license orders  attract and retain skilled personnel and deliver timely new products and enhancements 
performance could also be affected by the efforts to integrate eventus and b w s operations with those of the company  the success of those integration efforts  and market acceptance of the new products silkcontrol  silkpilot and silkrealizer 
services revenue services revenue increased to million in compared to million in the increase in service revenue is a result of the growth in the company s installed customer base and the increased training and consulting services performed for these customers 
maintenance revenue increased to million in compared to million in training and consulting revenue increased to million in compared to million in the increase in training and consulting revenue is also due to the introduction in the second quarter of of livequality scenario testing solutions  which consist of a combination of software product and consulting services 
moreover  one customer accounted for approximately of training and consulting revenue in cost of software cost of software increased to million  or of software revenue  in compared to million  or of software revenue  in the increase in cost of software in is due principally to the amortization and write off of the nre fee and prepaid royalties totaling million discussed below and the amortization of million for completed technology resulting from the december acquisition of sqlbench  offset by lower recurring royalty expenses of million  resulting from the company s intentional reduction in sales of royalty bearing products during  and by the cost of upgrading the installed base with new versions of various products 
in march we entered into an agreement with a vendor whereby the vender licensed to us specific software for purposes of marketing and distribution 
under the terms of this agreement  as amended in october  segue i paid  in which represented a non refundable nre and initial license fee of  and guaranteed royalties of  ii committed to spend  on defined marketing activities during the initial month term and each subsequent one year term of the agreement  and iii agreed to make guaranteed  annual royalty payments beginning october  of  for each one year term of the agreement 
this agreement was terminated in june through december   the nre fee was being amortized into cost of software revenue on a straight line basis over its estimated life of two years and the royalty expense was being recognized as cost of software based on sales of the related products 
for the year ended december   amortization expense and royalty expense related to this agreement were approximately  and  respectively 
as permitted under the agreement  segue management decided in the first quarter of to cease selling the licensed product  due to the fact that the license was generating minimal sales and that management had determined to focus efforts on the ebms products 
consequently  the company wrote off the remaining balances of  for the nre fee and approximately  for the prepaid royalties as cost of software as of december  as of that date additional prepaid royalties of  were also written off 
in december  we entered into a five year agreement with a vendor which provides for future royalty payments to the vendor of of net revenues achieved on sales of segue products to the vendor s customer base 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid a guaranteed  non refundable minimum royalty of  in december as of december   other current assets included approximately  and other long term assets included approximately  related to the guaranteed royalties 
cost of services cost of services increased to million  or of services revenue  in compared to million  or of services revenue  in the increase in cost of services is primarily due to the utilization of third party consultants to assist in livequality scenario testing solutions 
the cost of third party consultants is generally higher than the cost of internal resources 
the increases in amount and as a percentage of service revenue are also the result of increased investment in personnel needed to support the increased demand for training and consulting services 
headcount in the training and consulting and technical support groups increased from december  to december  sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of total revenue  in compared to million  or of total revenue  in the principal reasons for the absolute dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses were increased headcount  increases in commissions as a result of higher revenue levels and increases in related travel costs 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million  or of total revenue  in compared to million  or of total revenue  in the increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses is mainly attributable to the operations of the austria facility  which was only reflected in the company s operating results from the beginning of additionally  the increase is due to increased headcount 
research and development headcount  including that of the austrian facility  increased approximately from december  to december  the decrease in research and development as a percentage of total revenue is primarily due to the increase in total revenue 
during  segue introduced several new products including silkcontrol which is a web content management product and eventus principal product  silkpilot  a corba based distributed object testing product and a b w product  and silkrealizer which is for scenario testing and modeling 
subsequently in may management decided not to continue selling silkcontrol 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of total revenue  in compared to million  or of total revenue  in the increase in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses is attributable to increased headcount and related recruitment fees 
general and administrative headcount increased from december  to december  the decrease as a percentage of total revenue is primarily due to the increase in total revenue 
amortization of goodwill goodwill resulted from segue s acquisition of sqlbench in december and is being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
amortization expense increased to million  or of total revenue  compared to zero in non recurring and other charges in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million related to the eventus and b w acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this charge consisted primarily of investment banking  legal  accounting and other professional fees 
in the fourth quarter of  segue recorded a charge of  related to the write off of purchased research and development in process in conjunction with the sqlbench acquisition 
in process research and development identified at the acquisition date represented development projects in six areas that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the values of the in process research and development projects were determined using a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach reflecting each project s stage of completion at the acquisition date 
in those cash flow projections of in process technologies  we used discount rates ranging from to  as compared to a discount rate of used to value the completed technology acquired in the transaction 
the in process research and development projects were focused on the predictive and design aspects of load testing  which we expected would allow users greater ability to perform load testing early in the development phase instead of waiting until deployment 
the in process technologies were expected to provide improved load testing tools for client server and internet environments 
in addition to the  charge for acquired in process technologies discussed above  we recorded in the fourth quarter of a charge of  consisting of severance and accelerated vesting of options related to the resignation of the company s former president and chief executive officer 
other income expense  net other income  net decreased to million in compared to million in mainly due to interest expense associated with the issuance of notes in december related to the sqlbench acquisition 
in addition  the decrease is partly attributable to lower interest income caused by lower levels of investments 
provision for income taxes the company recorded a provision for foreign and state income taxes of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there was no tax benefit for losses generated in the us during and due to the uncertainty of realizing such benefits 
segue management evaluated the positive and negative evidence impacting the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
based on the weight of the available evidence  it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  and accordingly the deferred tax assets as of december  were fully reserved 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million 
our operating activities utilized cash of million in  compared to million in cash utilized in primarily reflects net loss adjusted for depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of in process research and development in connection with the sqlbench acquisition  as well as the change in accounts receivable as a result of our revenue growth and change in accounts payable  offset by increased accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
our investing activities utilized cash of million in compared to million in we purchased million of property and equipment in compared to million in the large increase consists primarily of a new management information system erp implemented in as well as the infrastructure costs related to the opening of a technical support center in northern ireland during the increase in property and equipment was largely offset by net maturities of short term investment 
additionally in  we made payments of million on acquisition related notes payable 
most of the cash used in investing activities was offset by net maturities of short term investments 
our financing activities provided cash of million and million in and  respectively  primarily due to the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
however  in  the proceeds from stock options were offset by the payment of notes payable 
in august  we moved our corporate headquarters to lexington  massachusetts  under a lease which expires in october the annual rental rate is approximately million 
we have the right to terminate the lease on september  for a fee of approximately million 
we recognized a one time pre tax charge of approximately million during the first quarter of related to a restructuring plan 
the restructuring charge included approximately  for severance and other employee related costs of the terminated staff and approximately  for facility related costs  including the accrual of estimated lease obligations associated with the closure of excess office facilities 
as of december   we have utilized available cash  cash equivalents and investments to make payments of approximately  related to these costs  and the related restructuring accrual balance was approximately  we expect to pay the remaining balance in at the time of the restructuring action  we expected to realize a reduction in recurring costs of approximately million annually as a result of the restructuring action 
however  there can be no assurance that these benefits will be realized 
we recognized non recurring and other charges of approximately million during the second quarter of of which million related to a restructuring plan and  related to the severance of two executive officers 
these restructuring and other charges includes approximately  of noncash charges and million of cash payments for severance and other employee related costs of terminated staff 
as of december   we have utilized available cash  cash equivalents and investments to pay approximately million of this amount  of which  was related to the restructuring 
we currently expect to make future cash payments of the remaining balance of  of which  is related to the restructuring  in at the time of the restructuring action  we expected to realize a reduction in recurring costs of approximately million annually as a result of this restructuring action 
however  there can be no assurance that these benefits will be realized 
during  segue implemented a new management information system erp for the cost of million that consists of approximately  for hardware  software and related maintenance and approximately million for implementation services 
as of december   we had paid approximately million for this project and expect to pay the remaining  in segue opened a technical support center in northern ireland during july we expect to incur total infrastructure costs related to this location of approximately million 
this expenditure will be partially funded by a grant of approximately  awarded by the northern ireland industrial development board idb of which  has been granted and paid by idb as of december  as of december   we had completed and equipped one of the two floors of the rented facility and paid approximately  of these total costs  and we expect to make additional cash payments of  for this project in the remaining  is reserved for future expansion that is still under management s consideration 
in december  we paid approximately million for the repayment of sqlbench notes 
these notes were issued in connection with the acquisition of sqlbench in december we expect to make the final note payment of approximately  in december additional long term cash requirements  other than normal operating expenses  are anticipated for the development of new software products and enhancements of existing products  the potential opening of additional international offices  and the possible acquisition of software products or technologies complementary to our business 
assuming there is no significant change in our business  we believe that the existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as well as cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
year compliance the year presents potential concerns for business and consumer computing 
the consequences of this issue may include systems failures and business process interruption 
it may also include additional business and competitive differentiation 
if we  our significant customers  or our suppliers fail to make necessary modifications and conversions on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
there are two other related issues which could also lead to incorrect calculations or failures i some systems programming assigns special meaning to certain dates  such as  and ii the year is a leap year 
to address these year issues with our internal systems  including information technology it and non it systems  segue implemented a program designed to deal with the most critical systems  packaged software applications  first 
as of september   we had completed our year compliance testing for our internal software systems  including the new mis system 
all of the company s core business hardware and software systems have been tested and are year compliant 
the company s internal desktop hardware systems were tested for year compliance and were found to be compliant 
additionally  the internal desktop software applications were tested and the company determined that these systems needed appropriate patches which were applied to bring these systems into year compliance 
the company completed these upgrades during the fourth quarter of in addition  the company implemented various types of contingency planning to address potential problem areas with internal systems  including a computer disaster recovery module which would allow the company to recover any of its backups in the case of a disaster 
all of our material systems were year compliant 
we also initiated formal communications with our significant vendors  mainly of it packaged applications  to determine the extent to which we would be vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
we received written assurances of year compliance from all significant vendors 
most of the vendors under existing contracts with segue are under no contractual obligation to provide such information to us 
we are taking steps with respect to new vendor agreements to ensure that the vendors products and internal systems are year compliant 
through march   our operations appear to be fully functioning with regard to year matters and we have not experienced any significant issues associated with the year problem discussed above 
costs associated with modifications segue made to make our systems year compliant were immaterial and we do not expect to incur additional material costs related to year issues 
there can be no assurance  however  that a failure by another company s system to be year compliant would not have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
certain factors affecting future operating results statements made or incorporated into this form k include a number of forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements include  without limitation  statements containing the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  future and words of similar import which express management s belief  expectations or intentions regarding our future performance 
segue s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
certain factors that might cause such a difference are discussed below and else where in this form k 
our quarterly results may fluctuate 
segue s quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
our quarterly revenue may fluctuate significantly for several reasons  including the timing of introductions of our new products or product enhancements by those of our competitors  personnel changes  the size and timing of individual orders  software bugs or other product quality problems  competition and pricing  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products or product enhancements  difficulty in predicting the size and timing of customer orders and the demand for segue products generally  changes in operating expenses  whether we are able to successfully expand our sales and marketing program mix of our product and services sold  and general economic conditions 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses are related to personnel  facilities and marketing programs 
the level of spending for such expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is based  in significant part  on expectations of future revenues 
if actual revenue levels are below management s expectations  results of operations are likely to be adversely affected 
in addition  segue does not typically experience order backlog 
furthermore  segue has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of a quarter  with these revenues frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
as a result  product revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in the latter part of that quarter  and revenues for any future quarter are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
for these reasons  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we may not be profitable in the future 
since segue began operations  it has generally experienced losses 
losses have resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  segue had a net loss of million in  which includes a charge of  for purchased research and development in process and  for severance charges  a net loss of million in  which includes a charge of million related to the eventus and b w acquisitions  a charge of  related to the write offs of an nre fee and guaranteed royalties and million for the amortization of goodwill and completed technology related to the sqlbench acquisition  and a net loss of million in which includes million for restructuring costs   for severance of senior executives  and million for the amortization goodwill and completed technology related to the sqlbench acquisition 
while we have experienced revenue growth in recent periods  continued growth at the same rate may not be sustainable and is not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
failure to sustain or increase profitability may adversely affect the market price of common stock 
the development of a market for segue products is uncertain 
the market for automated software testing products is relatively new and undeveloped 
marketing and sales techniques in the automated software testing marketplace  as well as the bases for competition  are not well established 
there can be no assurance as to the extent that a significant market for automated software testing products will develop or the extent to which segue products will be accepted in that market 
although we believe that the current trend toward increased use of automated software testing will continue  a majority of software testing is still carried out manually  and there can be no assurance that the automated software testing market will enjoy continued growth 
the success of segue products focused on e commerce and internet applications will depend on our ability to stay current and continue to enhance our products to work with all of the prevalent technologies driving internet applications 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively adapt our products to the prevalent technologies used on e commerce applications or to successfully compete in the market for internet related products and services 
as is typical for new and rapidly evolving industries  demand for recently introduced products is highly uncertain 
we may have difficulty managing recent changes 
segue has been experiencing a period of rapid growth  including increases in the number of orders and changes in customers and personnel 
this rapid growth has placed  and may continue to place  strains on our management  product offerings  services  operations and systems 
to manage future growth effectively  we must expand  improve and effectively utilize our operational  management  marketing  sales and financial systems as necessitated by changes in our business 
we have completed the implementation of a new management information system and opened a technical support center in northern ireland in  both of which could be disruptive 
additionally  as part in the restructuring plan of the first and second quarter of  we have significantly changed our sales management team and consolidated the position of senior vice president of research and development with the position of senior vice president and general manager of the executive management team 
in conjunction with these management changes  we have also changed the structure of our internal organization by adding product divisions which relate to our ebusiness testing products 
we have also refocused our sales and marketing approach to focus on e commerce applications 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage such changes and such changes are likely to be disruptive 
we may be subject to risks associated with our past acquisitions and future acquisitions 
in the fourth quarter of  segue acquired eventus software  inc and black white software  inc 
in two separate transactions 
our product range and customer base have increased in the recent past due in part to these acquisitions 
these acquisitions provided us with technologies to expand our current line of ebusiness testing products 
there can be no assurance that the integration of all of the acquired technologies will be successful or will not result in unforeseen difficulties  which may absorb significant management attention 
in the future  segue may acquire additional businesses or product lines 
the recently completed acquisitions  or any future acquisition  may not produce the revenue  earnings or business synergies that we had anticipated  and an acquired product  service or technology might not perform as expected 
prior to completing an acquisition  however  it is difficult to determine if such benefits can actually be realized 
the process of integrating acquired companies into our existing business may also result in unforeseen difficulties 
unforeseen operating difficulties may absorb significant management attention  which we might otherwise devote to our existing business 
also  the process may require significant financial resources that we might otherwise allocate to other activities  including the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 
if segue pursues a future acquisition  our management could spend a significant amount of time and effort in identifying and completing the acquisition 
to pay for a future acquisition  we might use capital stock or cash 
alternatively  we might borrow money from a bank or other lender 
if we use capital stock as we did with our past acquisitions  our stockholders would experience dilution of their ownership interests 
if we use cash or debt financing  our financial liquidity will be reduced 
we may not be able to continue expansion of our sales force 
we distribute our product and services primarily through our direct sales force 
our ability to continue to increase revenues in future periods will depend in large part on our ability to expand our direct sales force and provide a high level of technical consulting  training and customer support 
we are in the process of hiring additional sales and support personnel to broaden our direct selling and distribution capabilities 
we can not assure that we can build and train our sales force to satisfactorily meet increased revenue goals 
segue faces significant competition from other software companies 
the market for software quality management tools is new  intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
segue currently encounters competition from a number of public and private companies  including mercury interactive corporation  rational software corporation and compuware corporation 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed customer bases  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do and  therefore  may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
an increase in competition could result in price reductions and loss of market share 
we may not be able to respond quickly enough to competitive product offerings to be able to compete successfully in the future 
such competition and any resulting reduction in profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
segue s business could be adversely affected if its products contain errors 
software products as complex as ours may contain undetected errors or bugs which result in product failures 
the occurrence of errors could result in loss of or delay in revenue  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or damage to our efforts to build brand awareness  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
segue s future success will depend on our ability to respond rapidly and effectively to technological and other changes 
the nature of the automated software testing and ebusiness testing markets in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology  rapidly evolving customer needs and desires  changes in industry standards and practices and frequent releases of new product or enhancements by competitors 
to be competitive  segue must develop and introduce product enhancements and new products that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and potential customers 
failure to develop and introduce new products and enhancements successfully and on a timely basis  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the emerging nature of the automated software testing and e commerce testing markets requires that segue continually improve the performance  features and reliability of its products  particularly in response to competitive offerings and evolving customer needs 
we must also introduce enhancements to existing products as quickly as possible and prior to the introduction of competing products 
the development of technologies that result in new products or enhancements requires significant expenditures and utilization of resources 
we may not be successful in developing such technologies or may not be able to keep pace with technological developments 
we have acquired  and may in the future acquire  technologies to provide us with the tools to introduce new products or to enhance current products 
the success of such acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to effectively integrate the technologies 
certain lawsuits have been filed against segue which  if determined or settled in a manner adverse to segue  could adversely affect segue s financial condition 
on or about april   a putative class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against segue  its chief executive officer and a former chief financial officer of segue  captioned nathan rice v segue software  inc et al 
civil no 
cv irgs 
the class action complaint alleged the defendants violated the federal securities laws by making material misrepresentations and omissions in certain public disclosures during the period beginning on october  through april   inclusive 
the public disclosures relate to  among other things  segue s past and future financial performance and results 
on or about may   another similar putative class action complaint was filed against segue  its chief executive officer and a former chief financial officer of segue in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts  captioned anthony moumouris v segue software  inc  et al  civil no 
cv rgs 
these cases were consolidated under the caption in re segue software inc securities litigation  civil no 
cv rgs and the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on september  alleging a putative class period of july  through april   inclusive 
segue intends to defend the claims vigorously 
on november  each of the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a cause of action 
the plaintiffs have opposed the motions to dismiss on various grounds 
the court heard arguments on the motions on march   but has not yet rendered a decision on the motions 
it is not possible to predict when the court will rule on the motions or whether they will be granted in whole or in part 
segue believes the defense of the claims could involve significant litigation related expenses 
the outcome of these matters is uncertain and  as a result  at this time segue is not able to quantify any related financial exposure 
in the event that any of the claims set forth in the class action complaints are determined or settled in a manner adverse to segue  then such determination or settlements could adversely affect segue s financial position or results of operations in the period in which the litigation is resolved 
various other claims  charges and litigation have been asserted or commenced against the company arising from or related to contractual or employee relations 
while management does not believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company  we cannot assure you that an adverse resolution of one or more of these cases would not have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
segue must hire and retain skilled personnel in a tight labor market 
qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the software industry 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly sales and marketing personnel  software engineers and other senior personnel 
there is intense competition for sales personnel and software engineers in our business  and there can be no assurance that segue will be successful in attracting  integrating  motivating and retaining new sales personnel and software engineers 
the failure to attract and retain the highly skilled personnel that are integral to our direct sales  product development  service and support teams may limit the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have completed the shift in our focus from general software testing to ebusiness testing 
in  we began to develop and acquire technology to provide automated software testing for web enabled software applications  including the acquisition of sqlbench in december these developments allowed us to extend our testing capabilities beyond distributed client server applications with gui front ends 
in the second quarter of  segue introduced livequality  an ebusiness scenario testing solution 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired eventus software  inc and black white software  inc we anticipated that these acquisitions would provide us with other technologies to expand our current line of ebusiness testing products 
segue continued to develop and introduce other ebusiness products in  including our econfidence solution packages called econfidence functionality  econfidence performance and econfidence production 
our shift from a general software testing company to an ebusiness testing company has resulted in significant changes in our i organizational structure  ii management personnel  iii product mix  and iv sales approach 
these changes have required and continue to require significant management attention and have been and may continue to be disruptive 
we are reviewing the changes made in the past year and may make additional changes to affect our shift 
if we fail to effectively manage these changes  or make other changes that may be needed in connection with our shift to an ebusiness testing company  business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we face many risks associated with international business activities 
segue derived approximately of its total product sales from international customers in the international market for software products is highly competitive and we expect to face substantial competition in this market from established and emerging companies 
segue faces many risks associated with international business activities including currency fluctuations  imposition of government controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability  tailoring of products to local requirements  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations 
to the extent we are unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our business operations may be affected by unexpected year problems 
although to date we have not experienced any material problems attributable to the year problem with respect to our software products and internal systems  it is possible that our current products could contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions that may result in material costs or liabilities to us in the future 
moreover  our software directly and indirectly interacts with a large number of third party hardware and software systems  each of which may contain or introduce undetected errors or defects 
we are unable to predict to what extent our business may be affected if our software or the systems that operate in conjunction with our software experience a material year related failure 
any year defect in our products or the software and hardware systems with which our products operate  as well as any year errors caused by older non current products that were not upgraded by our customers  could expose us to litigation that could require us to incur significant costs in defending the litigation or expose us to the risk of significant damages 
the risks of this litigation may be particularly acute due to the mission critical applications for which our products are used 
segue may be subject to risks associated with its business partner program 
although segue has not historically sold significant amounts of its products through indirect channels  we intend to continue to develop system integrator sales as part of our business strategy 
there can be no assurance that our efforts will result in an increase in revenues 
furthermore  we may be subject to certain distinct risks associated with system integrator sales 
our current business partners may not be able to effectively sell or continue to effectively sell our products or new products 
we may not be able recruit additional or replacement business partners if any of our current business partners terminate their relationship with us 
segue licenses its products to business partners at a discount and such partners re license the products to end users 
our agreements with our business partners are non exclusive and provide the business partners with day price protection 
because our business partners generally order products after they have received purchase orders  there is no requirement that we repurchase any product 
we typically do not grant our business partners a contractual right to return software products 
when approved by management  however  we have accepted returns of certain software products and have provided an allowance for the specified products 
segue selects its business partners based on the partner s financial viability  product expertise and market focus 
in order for our strategy to broaden market penetration through our business partner program to be successful  we must increase our unit sales to offset the discount we are providing to our business partners 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed in the development of these programs 
moreover  selling through indirect channels may limit our contact with the end users of our products 
as a result  our ability to accurately forecast sales  evaluate customer satisfaction and recognize emerging customer requirements may be hindered and our ability to develop and maintain customer goodwill may be limited 
furthermore  our existing or future business partners may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies 
in addition  segue will need to resolve potential conflicts among its sales force and business partners 
segue could be subject to product liability claims 
in selling its products  segue relies primarily on shrink wrap licenses that contain  among other things  provisions protecting against the unauthorized use  copying and transfer of the licensed program and limiting segue s exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  these licenses are not signed by the licensees and the provisions of these licenses  including the provisions limiting segue s exposure to product liability claims  may therefore be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
segue products may be used on applications that are critical to the operations of its customers businesses 
any failure in a customer s application could result in a claim against segue for substantial damages  regardless of our responsibility for such failure 
although we maintain general liability insurance  including coverage for errors and omissions  there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
segue s success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
segue s success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from segue s technology without paying us for it 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
although we have taken steps to protect our proprietary technology  these efforts may be inadequate 
we currently rely on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights in our products 
currently  we have two issued patents and one additional application for patent filed with the united states patent and trademark office 
there can be no assurance that these patents would be upheld if challenged 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of risk 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert intellectual property infringement claims against segue 
if we were to discover that any of segue products violated third party proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms to continue offering the product without substantial reengineering or that any effort to undertake such reengineering would be successful 
any claim of infringement could cause segue to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract management resources from our business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our products 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments the company does not invest in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
all of the company s investments are in investment grade securities with high credit ratings of relative short duration that trade in highly liquid markets and approximate fair value on the company s books at december  accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposure the company s primary market risk exposure is in the area of interest rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio of cash equivalents is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
the company faces exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
currently  a majority of the company s business outside the united states is conducted in us dollar denominated transactions  whereas the company s operating expenses in its international subsidiaries are denominated in local currency 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures or for trading 
historically  the company s primary exposures have been related to the operations of its foreign subsidiaries 
to date  the net impact of foreign currency changes have not been material and is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition in the near term 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for most members of the european monetary union has taken place in the company s fiscal year the company has not determined the impact  if any  that the euro will have on foreign currency and business exposure
