item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the financial statements and the notes thereto and selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
historical operating results and percentage relationships among any amounts included in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
overview the company s core business is the manufacture and sale of high quality  precision steel balls and rollers 
in  balls accounted for approximately of the company s ball and roller net sales  while rollers accounted for the remaining 
although all of the company s net sales from through were exclusively to domestic customers  the company s international sales have increased significantly since then and represented approximately of net ball and roller sales in see note of the notes to financial statements 
since the company was formed  growth factors include its displacement of captive ball manufacturing divisions of domestic and international bearing manufacturers as a source of precision balls and increased sales of high precision balls for quiet bearing applications 
sales of high precision balls produced by the company for use in quiet bearing applications has grown to approximately of total net ball sales 
management believes that the company s sales growth since its formation has been due to its ability to capitalize on opportunities in overseas markets and provide precision balls at competitive prices  as well as its emphasis on product quality and customer service 
the sales decline in the last couple of years has been due in large part to economic conditions in asia and south america and a decline in outsourcing by certain captive producers 
further  the company was adversely affected by increased competition from asian based competitors who sought to reduce over capacity 
as a result of changing dynamics in the marketplace  the company has developed an extensive new long term growth strategy 
the development of this strategy entailed the review of the company s core business and strategies for growth as well as an extensive identification of additional growth opportunities beyond the core markets that were consistent with the company s strengths and culture 
one industry that was identified through this process was the plastic injection molding industry 
on july   the company acquired substantially all of the assets of earsley capital corporation  a successor to and formerly known as industrial molding corporation  a texas corporation 
imc provides premier full service design and manufacture of plastic injection molded components to the bearing  automotive  electronic  leisure and consumer markets with an emphasis on value added products that take advantage of its unique capabilities in product development  tool design and tight tolerance molding processes 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected financial data and the percentage of the company s net sales represented by each income statement line item presented 
as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of product sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations interest expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales 
the company s net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in the imc acquisition accounted for million in additional sales for the twelve month period in foreign net sales decreased million or  from million in to million in the decrease in foreign net sales was due primarily to decreased sales volumes with existing customers  largely due to general economic conditions in asia and the impact of the relative strength of the us dollar against world currencies in the first two quarters of the year 
this was partially offset by the addition of  in foreign sales contributed by the imc acquisition 
domestic net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to the imc acquisition which contributed million in domestic sales for this was partially offset by decreased domestic sales primarily to one customer 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or from million in to million in the imc acquisition accounted for million in increased gross profit but was mostly offset by increased costs associated with capacity under utilization in the ball roller division due to decreased levels of volume during as well as the short term impact of the inventory reduction efforts 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or in to million from million in the acquisition of imc accounted for million of the increase offset by decreased spending in the ball roller division 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to in from in depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense increased million  or  to million in from million in the acquisition of imc accounted for million of increased depreciation and amortization expense 
the remainder of the increase was due to purchases of capital equipment at the company s ball and roller facilities 
as a percentage of net sales  depreciation increased to in from in interest expense 
interest expense increased  from  in to  in the increase was due to increased levels outstanding under the company s line of credit in in july of  the company borrowed million under the line of credit for the purchase of selected assets of the earsley capital corporation

net income 
net income increased  or from million in to million in as a percentage of net sales  net income decreased to in from in the decrease in net income as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to excess capacity at the company s ball roller division and a related gross profit margin decrease  increased depreciation expense and interest expense related to the imc acquisition 
offsetting these factors was a slightly lower federal tax rate 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales 
the company s net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in foreign net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in foreign net sales was due primarily to decreased sales volumes to existing customers  largely due to general economic conditions in asia and south america

gross profit 
gross profit decreased by  or from million in to million in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased slightly from in to in the decrease in gross profit is largely due to decreased levels of volume during as compared to and related capacity under utilization issues at the company s manufacturing facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or in to million from million in this increase was due primarily to increased expenses related to the ireland facility  which began production in the fourth quarter of  as well as increases in to implement the company s strategic plan 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in depreciation expense 
depreciation expense increased  or  to million in from million in this increase was due primarily to purchases of capital equipment related to the new ireland facility which began production in the fourth quarter of as a percentage of sales  depreciation expense increased to in from in net income 
net income decreased  or from million in to million in as a percentage of net sales  net income decreased from in to in the decrease in net income as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to excess capacity at the company s manufacturing facilities  increased selling  general and administrative expenses and the increase in depreciation expense discussed above 
slightly offsetting these factors was a lower federal tax rate due to the shifting of sales to the irish facility which benefits from a corporate tax rate 
the lower federal tax rate was in turn offset slightly by a decrease in the level of tax benefit from the company s participation in a shared foreign sales corporation 
liquidity and capital resources in july  the company entered into a loan agreement with first american national bank first american which provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million  expiring on june  in december  the company extended the terms of the loan agreement with first american to expire on july  amounts outstanding under the revolving facility are unsecured and bear interest at a floating rate equal to  at the company s option  either libor plus or the fed funds effective rate plus 
the loan agreement contains customary financial and operating restrictions on the company  including covenants  restricting the company  without first american s consent  from incurring additional indebtedness from  or pledging any of its assets to  other lenders and from disposing of a substantial portion of its assets 
in addition  the company is prohibited from declaring any dividend if a default exists under the revolving credit facility at the time of  or would occur as a result of  such declaration 
the loan agreement also prohibits sales of property outside of the ordinary course of business 
the loan agreement also contains customary financial covenants with respect to the company  including a covenant that the company s earnings will not decrease in any year by more than fifty percent of earnings in the company s immediately preceding fiscal year 
the company  as of march  was in compliance with all such covenants 
the company s arrangements with its domestic customers typically provide that payments are due within days following the date of the company s shipment of goods  while arrangements with foreign customers other than foreign customers that have entered into an inventory management program with the company generally provide that payments are due within either or days following the date of shipment 
under the company s inventory management program  payments typically are due within days after the product is used by the customer 
the company s net sales historically have not been of a seasonal nature 
however  seasonality has become a factor for the foreign ball and roller sales in that many foreign customers cease production during the month of august 
the company also experiences seasonal fluctuation through its imc plastics division which provides several lines of seasonal hardware 
the company bills and receives payment from some of its foreign customers in their local currency 
to date  the company has not been materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations or foreign exchange restrictions 
nonetheless  as a result of these sales  the company s foreign exchange risk has increased 
various strategies to manage this risk are under development and implementation  including a hedging program 
in addition  a strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies could impair the ability of the company to compete with international competitors for foreign as well as domestic sales 
working capital  which consists principally of accounts receivable and inventories  was million at december  as compared to million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased from at december  to at december  cash flow from operations increased to million during from million during this increase was primarily attributed to a decrease of million of inventories during as compared to an increase of million during during  the company plans to spend approximately million on capital expenditures 
the company intends to finance these activities with cash generated from operations and funds available under the credit facility described above 
the company believes that funds generated from operations and borrowings from the credit facility will be sufficient to finance the company s working capital needs and projected capital expenditure requirements through december subsequent events on january   the company entered into a principle agreement to establish a joint venture with general bearing corporation 
this venture subsequently closed on march  the new venture  nn general  llc  will own a majority position in jiangsu general ball roller company  ltd  a chinese precision ball and roller manufacturer located in rugao city  jiangsu providence china 
through nn general  llc  the company will equally share a interest with general bearing company in the chinese company 
the company s investment includes a cash contribution of million and a loan commitment for an additional million 
the remaining of the chinese company is owned by jiangsu steel ball factory 
on march   the company experienced a fire at its erwin  tennessee facility 
the fire  which was contained to approximately of the production area  occurred in the early morning hours when only three employees were in the facility 
these employees were immediately evacuated and no one was injured 
effected production is being shifted to the company s other facilities as possible as well as the use of other suppliers to protect product supply to customers 
the cause of the fire remains under investigation and management is continuing to assess damage to the facility 
insurance coverage is available for the loss 
the euro the treaty on european union provided that an economic and monetary union be established in europe whereby a single european currency  the euro  was introduced to replace the currencies of participating member states 
the euro was introduced on january   at which time the value of participating member state currencies were irrevocably fixed against the euro and the european currency unit 
for the three year transitional period ending december   the national currencies of member states will continue to circulate but be in sub units of the euro 
at the end of the transitional period  euro bank notes and coins will be issued  and the national currencies of the member states will be legal tender no later than june  the company currently has operations in ireland  which is one of the euro participating countries  and sells product to customers in many of the participating countries 
the functional currency of the company s ireland operations was changed effective september  seasonality and fluctuation in quarterly results the company s net sales historically have not been of a seasonal nature 
however  as foreign sales have increased as a percentage of total sales  seasonality has become a factor for the company in that many foreign customers cease production during the month of august 
for information concerning the company s quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and  see note of the notes to financial statements 
inflation and changes in prices while the company s operations have not been affected by inflation during recent years  prices for steel and other raw materials purchased by the company are subject to change 
for example  during  due to an increase in worldwide demand for steel and the decrease in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies  the company experienced an increase in the price of steel and some difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of steel from its existing suppliers 
typically  the company s pricing arrangements with its steel suppliers are subject to adjustment once every six months 
in an effort to limit its exposure to fluctuations in steel prices  the company has generally avoided the use of long term  fixed price contracts with its customers 
instead  the company typically reserves the right to increase product prices periodically in the event of increases in its raw material costs 
the company was able to minimize the impact on its operations resulting from the steel price increases by taking such measures 
cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company wishes to caution readers that this report contains  and future filings by the company  press releases and oral statements made by the company s authorized representatives may contain  forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements due to important factors bearing on the company s business  many of which already have been discussed in this filing and in the company s prior filings 
the following paragraphs discuss the risk factors the company regards as the most significant  although the company wishes to caution that other factors that are currently not considered as significant or that currently cannot be foreseen may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company s results of operations 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
industry risks 
both the precision ball roller and precision plastics industries are cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production 
the company s sales in the past have been negatively affected  and in the future very likely would be negatively affected  by adverse conditions in the industrial production sector of the economy or by adverse global or national economic conditions generally 
competition 
the precision ball roller market and the precision plastics markets are highly competitive  and many of manufacturers in each of the markets are larger and have substantially greater resources than the company 
the company s competitors are continuously exploring and implementing improvements in technology and manufacturing processes in order to improve product quality  and the company s ability to remain competitive will depend  among other things  on whether it is able  in a cost effective manner  to keep pace with such quality improvements 
in addition  the company competes with many of its ball and roller customers that  in addition to producing bearings  also internally produce balls and rollers for sale to third parties 
the company faces a risk that its customers will decide to produce balls and rollers internally rather than outsourcing their needs to the company 
rapid growth 
the company has significantly expanded its ball and roller production facilities and capacity over the last several years  and during the third quarter of purchased an additional manufacturing plant in kilkenny  ireland 
the company s ball roller division currently is not operating at full capacity and faces risks of further under utilization or inefficient utilization of its production facilities in future years 
the company also faces risks associated with start up expenses  inefficiencies  delays and increased depreciation costs associated with its plant expansions 
raw material shortages 
because the balls and rollers manufactured by the company have highly specialized applications  their production requires the use of very particular types of steel 
due to quality constraints  the company obtains the majority of its steel from overseas suppliers 
steel shortages or transportation problems  particularly with respect to steel  could have a detrimental effect on the company s business 
risks associated with international trade 
because the company obtains a majority of its raw materials for the manufacture of balls and rollers from overseas suppliers and sells to a large number of international customers  the company faces risks associated with i adverse foreign currency fluctuations  ii changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations  and other activities of governments  agencies and similar organizations  iii the imposition of trade restrictions or prohibitions  iv the imposition of import or other duties or taxes  and v unstable governments or legal systems in countries in which the company s suppliers and customers are located 
an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies adversely affects the ability of the company to compete with its foreign based competitors for international as well as domestic sales 
dependence on major customers 
during  the company s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of its net sales 
sales to various us and foreign divisions of skf  which is one of the largest bearing manufacturers in the world  accounted for approximately of net sales in  and sales to fag accounted for approximately of net sales 
none of the company s other customers accounted for more than of its net sales in  but sales to three of its customers each represented more than of the company s net sales 
the loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to these customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
acquisitions 
the company s growth strategy includes growth through acquisitions 
in july  the company acquired imc as part of that strategy 
although the company believes that it will be able to integrate the operations of imc and other companies acquired in the future into its operations without substantial cost  delays or other problems  its ability to do so will depend on  among other things  the adequacy of its implementation plans  the ability of its management to effectively oversee and operate the combined operations of the company and the acquired businesses and its ability to achieve desired operating efficiencies and sales goals 
if the company is not able to successfully integrate the operations of acquired companies into its business  its future earnings and profitability could be materially and adversely affected 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and is effective for the company s reporting cycle 
the adoption of this standard by the company is not expected to result in significant adjustments to existing accounting practices as the company does not currently hold any derivative financial instruments or participate in hedging activities 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies 
to mitigate its exposure to these market risks  the company has established policies  procedures and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities  which include a million floating rate revolving credit facility which is used to maintain liquidity and fund its business operations 
at december   the company had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
a one percent increase in the interest rate charged on the company s outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility would result in interest expense increasing by approximately  the nature and amount of the company s borrowings may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the company s operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
beginning in the fourth quarter  upon the commencement of production in its kilkenny  ireland facility  the company began to bill and receive payment from some of its foreign customers in their own currency 
to date  the company has not been materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations of foreign exchange restrictions 
however  as foreign sales approximate of total revenues  management is currently evaluating various strategies to manage this financial market risk  including the implementation of a foreign currency hedging program 
the company did not hold a position in any foreign currency instruments of december
