item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations page of annual shareholder report below management s discussion and analysis overview cryolife  inc was organized in to address market opportunities in the area of biological implantable products and materials  and today is the leader in the cryopreservation of viable human tissue for cardiovascular  vascular  and orthopedic applications 
the company began cryopreserving aortic heart valves in  pulmonary heart valves in  and mitral heart valves in the company has also expanded into the cryopreservation of other human tissue  including vascular tissue and connective tissue of the knee 
the company pays a fee to an organ procurement agency or tissue bank at the time such organization consigns human tissue to the company 
the company generates revenues from cryopreservation services by charging hospitals a fee  which covers the company s services  the associated procurement fee  and applicable shipping expenses 
the company records revenue upon shipping tissue 
costs associated with the procurement  processing  and storage of tissue are accounted for as deferred preservation costs on the company s consolidated balance sheet and are expensed when the tissue is shipped 
the company continually monitors cryopreserved tissue in its possession to determine its viability 
tissue determined not to be suitable for implantation is disposed of and the associated deferred preservation costs are expensed 
as part of an effort to reduce its working capital needs  while simultaneously facilitating the use of cryopreserved tissue  the company consigns liquid nitrogen freezers to a number of hospitals 
the company retains ownership of the liquid nitrogen freezers and  consequently  incurs associated depreciation charges 
the hospitals are responsible for operating expenses related to the use of the liquid nitrogen freezers 
the company has expanded  and intends to continue to expand  its portfolio of products and services 
much of this expansion has been accomplished through acquisitions of intellectual property and businesses 
in  the company purchased for  the exclusive distribution rights for a line of stentless aortic porcine heart valves and in purchased for  a patent for an advanced design stentless pulmonary porcine heart valve  both of which the company currently markets in europe  south america  the middle east  and south africa 
in  the company purchased the patent for bioglue  a surgical adhesive which the company currently markets in north america  europe  south america  asia  south africa  and the middle east 
in  the company also acquired the assets of ucfi  a tissue processor  for  in cash and a million note 
in  the company acquired ideas for medicine  inc ifm and its line of single use medical devices for million in cash  and a million convertible debenture 
on september  the company completed the sale of substantially all of the ifm product line and certain related assets to horizon medical products  inc hmp for million in cash pursuant to an asset purchase agreement 
concurrently  ifm and hmp signed a manufacturing agreement the agreement which provides for the manufacture by ifm of specified minimum dollar amounts of ifm products to be purchased exclusively by hmp over each of the four years following the sale 
thereafter  responsibility for such manufacturing is to be assumed by hmp 
the company recorded a deferred gain at the transaction date totaling million  representing the selling price less the net book value of the assets sold  which included million of goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  and the costs related to the sale 
the gain was deferred because the sale and the manufacturing agreements represent  in the aggregate  a single transaction for which the related income should be recognized over the term of the agreement 
accordingly  the deferred gain is being amortized in cost of goods sold over the four year term of the manufacturing agreement in a manner which is expected to result in approximately equal margins over the four year period on the products manufactured and sold by ifm to hmp 
during and amortization of deferred revenue totaled million and  respectively 
as more fully discussed under nonrecurring charges in the results of operations section  hmp defaulted on the agreement in june of the composition of the company s revenues is expected to change in future years  reflecting  among other things  the anticipated growth in shipments of human vascular tissue and human connective tissue for the knee  and the introduction of bioglue surgical adhesive into domestic and international markets  as well as other expected new products 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in revenues was primarily due to increased acceptance in the medical community of cryopreserved tissues  the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue  price increases for certain cryopreservation services instituted during the third quarter of which continued during  a full year of bioglue international revenue in as compared to nine months in  and revenues attributable to the company s introduction of osteoarticular grafts in january these increases in revenues have been offset by certain decreases in revenues as discussed below 
revenues from human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services decreased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
this decrease in revenues resulted from an decrease in the number of heart allograft shipments primarily resulting from a decrease in the number of pulmonary heart valve shipments due to a decrease in the number of ross procedures being performed and competitive price pressures on pulmonary valves 
in a ross procedure  the patient s pulmonary valve is transplanted into the aortic position and a human pulmonary allograft is transplanted into the patient s pulmonary position 
the company has attempted to promote the positive clinical results of the ross procedure by hosting science forums around the country with its cardiovascular surgeon customers 
although we are currently unable to predict the annual trend in pulmonary heart valve shipments  shipments through march  are up over shipments through march  revenues from human vascular tissue cryopreservation services increased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of vascular allograft shipments attributable to an increased demand for preserved vascular tissue  the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue  and the introduction of the femoral vein program for use as a v shuts in dialysis patients 
the increase in revenues was also due to the company s focus on procuring and distributing long segment veins  which have a higher per unit revenue than the short segment veins 
revenues from human connective tissue of the knee cryopreservation services increased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of allograft shipments due to increased demand  the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue  and the introduction of preserved osteoarticular grafts in january of additional revenue increases resulted from price increases for the cryopreservation of menisci and tendons during the third quarter of revenues from ifm decreased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
the decrease in revenues is due to hmp s failure to meet the minimum purchase requirements set forth in the agreement as more fully discussed below 
revenues from bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices increased to  in from  in  representing of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was due to a increase in the number of bioprosthetic cardiovascular device shipments due to an increase in demand  a full year of international revenues from the cryolife ross pulmonary valve in as compared to three months of revenues in  and price increases in november of that continued throughout revenues from bioglue surgical adhesive increased to million for from  in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
the increase in revenues is due to a increase in the volume of bioglue shipments due to increased product awareness as a result of the introduction of bioglue in international markets in april of  increased surgeon training  and the receipt of the ce mark approval for the use of bioglue for pulmonary indications in europe in march grant revenues increased to  in from  in this increase in grant revenues is primarily attributable to the synergraft research and development programs 
other income decreased to  in from million in other income in relates primarily to proceeds from the sale of the company s port product line 
cost of cryopreservation services and products aggregated million in compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total cryopreservation and product revenues 
the increase of the cost of cryopreservation services and products as a percentage of revenues in results from a smaller percentage of revenues being derived from human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services  which carry a significantly higher gross margin than other cryopreservation services 
an additional reason for the increase in costs in results from the switch in october of to oem manufacturing of single use medical devices  which generates lower gross margins than cryopreservation services and lower gross margins than the ifm products generated prior to the sale of the ifm product line 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total cryopreservation and product revenues in such periods 
the increase in expenditures in resulted from expenses incurred to support the increase in revenues  partially offset by increased absorption of overhead expenses associated with increased production of new products 
research and development expenses decreased to million in  compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total cryopreservation and product revenues for each period 
research and development spending relates principally to the company s focus on its bioadhesives and synergraft technologies 
the company recorded a nonrecurring charge of million in primarily as a result of hmp s default on its manufacturing contract with ifm 
on june  ifm notified hmp that it was in default of certain provisions of the agreement 
specifically  hmp is in violation of the payment provisions contained within the agreement  which calls for inventory purchases to be paid for within days of delivery 
additionally  hmp is in violation due to nonpayment of interest related to such past due accounts receivable 
after notification of the default  hmp indicated to the company that it would not be able to meet and has not met the minimum purchase requirements outlined in the agreement 
the company has been negotiating with hmp in order to reach a mutually agreeable solution to the default  however  due to the significant uncertainties related to the company s ability to realize its investment in ifm  the company determined that it had incurred an impairment loss on its ifm assets 
in calculating the amount of the impairment loss  management used its best estimate to determine the realizable value of its increase in working capital due to the hmp default  and the recoverability of ifm s long lived assets  consisting primarily of leasehold improvements and equipment 
as a result  management recorded a million impairment loss on working capital and a million impairment loss on leasehold improvements 
additionally  the company offset the above charges with million of deferred gain recorded in connection with the sale of the ifm product line to hmp 
the net pretax effect of the above nonrecurring charges is million  and has been included under the caption nonrecurring charges in the accompanying consolidated income statements 
net interest income was million and  in and  respectively 
this increase in interest income is due to recording a full year of interest income on the invested proceeds from the follow on equity offering the offering completed in april  lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of certain indebtedness with the proceeds from the offering  and the conversion of certain convertible debentures into common stock of the company 
the increase in the effective income tax rate to in from in  is the result of the nonrecurrence of income tax benefits realized in from the implementation of certain income tax planning strategies in the fourth quarter  which had a significant one time impact on taxes 
despite the increase in the tax rate between and  the effective tax rate is reflective of the ongoing impact of these tax planning strategies 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in revenues was primarily due to increased acceptance in the medical community of cryopreserved tissues  the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue  price increases for certain cryopreservation services  revenues attributable to the company s line of single use medical devices following the ifm acquisition in march of  and revenues attributable to the company s introduction of bioglue surgical adhesive in international markets in april revenues from human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services increased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of heart allograft shipments due to an increased demand and the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue 
revenues from human vascular tissue cryopreservation services increased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of vascular allograft shipments due to an increased demand and the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue 
revenues from human connective tissue for the knee cryopreservation services increased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of allograft shipments due to increased demand and the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue 
additional revenue increases resulted from a greater proportion of the shipments consisting of cryopreserved menisci  which have a significantly higher per unit revenue than the company s cryopreserved tendons  and price increases for the cryopreservation of menisci and tendons 
revenues from ifm increased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was due to having two additional months of ifm revenue than due to the ifm acquisition closing on march   partially offset by the sale of the ifm product line to hmp pursuant to which the company became an oem manufacturer of such products on october  revenues from bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices increased to  in from  in  representing of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of bioprosthetic cardiovascular device shipments due to increased manufacturing capacity 
revenues in also benefited from the introduction of the cryolife ross pulmonary valve into international markets in october revenues from bioglue were  for the company introduced the product into international markets in april grant revenues increased to  in from  in this increase in grant revenues is primarily attributable to the synergraft research and development programs 
other income increased to  in from  in other income in relates primarily to proceeds from the sale of the company s port product line 
cost of cryopreservation services and products aggregated million in compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total cryopreservation and product revenues 
the increase in of the cost of cryopreservation services and products as a percentage of revenues results from a lesser portion of revenues being derived from human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services  which carry significantly higher gross margins than other cryopreservation services  from increased manufacturing overhead costs associated with the company s new manufacturing facilities  from the switch in october of to oem manufacturing of single use medical devices  which generates lower gross margins than cryopreservation services and lower gross margins than the ifm products generated prior to the sale of the ifm product line  compared with ten months of ifm sales in  and from a one time charge of  associated with the start up of the bioprosthetic cardiovascular device manufacturing facility 
the increase in the cost of cryopreservation services and products as a percentage of revenues was partially offset by a decrease in the ifm products sold in relative to those sold in  which generate lower gross margins than cryopreservation services  and the impact of the fourth quarter amortization of deferred gain resulting from the sale of the ifm product line  which has the impact of reducing cost of goods sold 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total cryopreservation and product revenues in such periods 
the increase in expenditures in resulted from expenses incurred to support the increase in revenues and costs associated with the introduction of bioglue into international markets 
research and development expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  representing of total cryopreservation and product revenues for each period 
research and development spending relates principally to the company s focus on its bioadhesives and synergraft technologies 
net interest income was  in compared to net interest expense of  in this variance is due to the repayment of certain indebtedness with the proceeds from the follow on equity offering completed in april  as well as the conversion of a portion of a convertible debenture into common stock of the company  and the receipt of interest income on the invested proceeds from the offering 
the decline in the effective income tax rate to in from in is due to the implementation of certain income tax planning strategies including the recognition of approximately  of research and development tax credits during the fourth quarter of  during which period studies were completed which quantified the amounts related thereto 
seasonality the demand for the company s human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services is seasonal  with peak demand generally occurring in the second and third quarters 
management believes this trend for human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services is primarily due to the high number of surgeries scheduled during the summer months 
management believes the trends experienced by the company for its human connective tissue of the knee cryopreservation services indicate this business may also be seasonal because it is an elective procedure which may be performed less frequently during the fourth quarter s holiday season 
however  the demand for the company s vascular tissue cryopreservation services  bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices  single use medical devices  and bioglue surgical adhesive does not appear to experience seasonal trends 
liquidity and capital resources at december  net working capital was million  compared to million at december   with a current ratio of to the company s primary capital requirements arise out of general working capital needs  capital expenditures for facilities and equipment  funding of research and development projects  and a common stock repurchase plan approved by the board of directors in october of the company historically has funded these requirements through bank credit facilities  cash generated by operations  and equity offerings 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in this decrease primarily resulted from an increase in the growth of deferred preservation costs due to the inventory build up associated with the introduction of new product lines  and an increase in the amount of accounts payable liquidated in the first quarter of as compared to the first quarter of due to the expansion of the bioglue manufacturing laboratory at corporate headquarters  partially offset by an increase in net income excluding the nonrecurring charge of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses  and an increase in accrued expenses due to an increase in tissue procurement 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  as compared to million in this decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures and in purchases of marketable equity securities during  partially offset by the absence of proceeds from the sale of the ifm product line in  as compared to net cash used in financing activities was million in  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in the net cash inflow was primarily attributable to a follow on equity offering in march of that generated proceeds of million  partially offset by the repayment of borrowings on the company s bank loans  and accrued interest thereon  totaling million 
the company used funds in primarily to increase repurchases of treasury stock 
management is currently seeking to complete a potential private placement of equity or equity oriented securities to form a subsidiary company for the commercial development of its serine proteinase light activation technologies 
this strategy  if successful  will allow an affiliated entity to fund the light activation technology and should expedite the commercial development of its blood clot dissolving and surgical sealant product applications without additional research and development expenditures by the company other than through the affiliated company 
this strategy  if successful  will favorably impact the company s liquidity going forward 
the company has ceased further development of light activation technology pending the identification of a corporate partner to fund future development 
the company began its search for a corporate partner in october and anticipates locating a partner during fiscal as of december   the company classified approximately million of equipment and other assets related to the light activation technologies as being held for sale 
the company anticipates that current cash and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its operating and development needs for at least the next months  including the expansion of the company s corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities 
additionally  the company currently maintains a million unrestricted line of credit that expires on december  however  the company s future liquidity and capital requirements beyond that period will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing of the company s receipt of fda approvals to begin clinical trials for its products currently in development  the resources required to further develop its marketing and sales capabilities if and when those products gain approval  the resources required to expand its corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility  and the extent to which the company s products generate market acceptance and demand 
there can be no assurance the company will not require additional financing or will not seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings  or other sources of capital to meet future requirements 
these additional funds may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk page of annual shareholder report below the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million in municipal obligations as of december   as well as interest paid on its debt 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in us interest rates  the company generally maintains to of its debt as fixed rate in nature 
as a result  the company is subject to a risk that interest rates will decrease and the company may be unable to refinance its debt
