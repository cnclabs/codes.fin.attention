in  the company recognized an additional million loss associated with the writedown of bertolotti s assets to their fair value resulting from the sale 
offsetting the loss was a tax benefit of million resulting from the sale 
management s discussion and analysis continued integration costs the company recognized million and million of integration costs in and  respectively  in connection with the acquisitions of t n  cooper automotive and fel pro 
these expenses included one time items such as brand integration  costs to pack and move productive inventory and fixed assets from one location to another  and costs to change the identity of entities acquired

the company entered into the above transactions to serve as economic hedges for the purchase of t n

liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided from operating activities cash flow provided from operating activities was million in cash flows were generated primarily from net earnings plus depreciation and amortization

cash flow used by investing activities cash flow used by investing activities was million in the company used million to fund business acquisitions  including the piston division of alcan  crane and the final payments of million related to its acquisition of cooper automotive 
capital expenditures of million were to implement process improvements  increase manufacturing capacity  information technology  integration of acquired businesses and new product introductions 
management s discussion and analysis continued cash flow provided from financing activities cash flow provided from financing activities was million in  primarily arising from proceeds of  million from the issuance of long term debt and provided by the investment in accounts receivable securitization

in january  the company issued billion of bonds with maturities ranging from seven to ten years  a weighted average yield of and a weighted average coupon of 
proceeds were used to repay borrowings under the senior credit agreements

litigation and environmental matters t n asbestos litigation in the united states  the company s united kingdom subsidiary  t n ltd  and two former united states subsidiaries of t n  plc 
the t n companies are among many defendants named in numerous court actions alleging personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos or asbestos containing products 
t n is also subject to asbestos disease litigation  to a lesser extent  in the united kingdom and france 
because of the slow onset of asbestos related diseases  management anticipates that similar claims will be made in the future 
it is not known how many such claims may be made nor the expenditures which may arise therefrom 
as of december   the t n companies had approximately  claims pending 
during  approximately  new claims were filed and  claims were settled  dismissed or otherwise resolved 
in addition to the pending cases above  the t n companies have approximately  claims that have been settled but will be paid over time 
there are a number of factors that could impact the settlement costs into the future  including but not limited to changes in legal environment  possible insolvency of co defendants  and the establishment of an acceptable administrative non litigation claims resolution mechanism 
the billion total provision held for the t n companies is comprised of an estimate for known claims pending and settled but not paid and possible future claims ibnr 
as of december   the billion total provision is comprised of approximately million related to known claims and approximately million related to ibnr claims 
in arriving at the ibnr provision for the t n companies  assumptions have been made regarding the total number of claims anticipated to be received in the future  the typical cost of settlement which is sensitive to the industry in which the plaintiff claims exposure  the alleged disease type and the jurisdiction in which the action is being brought  the rate of receipt of claims and the timing of settlement and  in the united kingdom  the level of subrogation claims brought by insurance companies 
t n ltd 
has appointed the center for claims resolution ccr as its exclusive representative in relation to all asbestos related personal injury claims made against it in the united states 
the ccr provides to its management s discussion and analysis continued member companies a litigation defense  claims handling and administration service in respect to united states asbestos related disease claims 
pursuant to the ccr producer agreement  t n ltd 
is entitled to appoint a representative as one of the five voting directors on the ccr s board of directors 
members of the ccr contribute towards indemnity payments in each claim in which the member is named 
contributions to such indemnity payments are calculated on a case by case basis according to sharing agreements among the ccr s members 
effective january   the two united states subsidiaries withdrew from the ccr membership and appointed a law firm specializing in asbestos matters as their claims handling defense and administrative service provider 
indemnity and defense obligations incurred while members of the ccr will continue to be honored 
this change is intended to create greater economic and defense efficiencies for the two companies 
in  t n purchased a pounds million approximately million at the insurance agreement exchange rate of pounds layer of insurance which will be triggered should the aggregate costs of claims filed after june   where the exposure occurred prior to that date  exceed pounds million approximately  million at the pounds exchange rate 
the initial reserve provided for the t n companies for claims filed after june  approximated the trigger point of the insurance 
the company has reviewed the financial viability and legal obligations of the three reinsurance companies involved and has concluded  at this time  that there is little risk of the reinsurers not being able to meet their obligation to pay  should the claims filed after june  exceed the pounds million trigger point 
while management believes that reserves are appropriate for anticipated losses arising from asbestos related claims against the t n companies  given the nature and complexity of the factors affecting the estimated liability  the actual liability may differ 
no absolute assurance can be given that the t n companies will not be subject to material additional liabilities and significant additional litigation relating to asbestos 
in the possible  but unlikely event that such liabilities exceed the reserves recorded by the company and the additional pounds million of insurance coverage  the company s results of operations  business  liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the reserve for the t n companies is re evaluated periodically as additional information becomes available 
during  t n ltd 
was named in a complaint filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas by owens illinois alleging that t n is liable to owens illinois for owens illinois own indemnity and defense costs pertaining to asbestos related personal injury claims 
the company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claim and has successfully defended against similar underlying claims in the past 
cooper automotive asbestos litigation former businesses of cooper automotive  primarily abex and wagner  are involved as defendants in numerous court actions in the united states alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos or asbestos containing products  mainly involving friction products 
in  the company acquired the capital stock of a cooper automotive entity resulting in the assumption by a company subsidiary of contractual liability  under certain circumstances  for all claims pending and to be filed in the future alleging exposure to certain wagner automotive and industrial friction products and for all claims filed after august   alleging exposure to certain abex non railroad and non aircraft friction products 
as of december   abex has approximately  claims pending and wagner has approximately  claims pending 
the company has completed its assessment of the potential liability and related potential insurance recoveries related to the cooper automotive acquisition and has recorded a million insurance recoverable asset and a liability of the subsidiaries involved of approximately million 
this is the company s estimate  after taking into account legal counsel s evaluation related to amounts expected to be paid or reimbursed by insurers 
in arriving at these provisions  certain assumptions have been made regarding the total number of claims which may be received in the future against these two entities and the average costs associated with such claims 
management s discussion and analysis continued abex maintained product liability insurance coverage for most of the time that it manufactured products that contained asbestos 
the subsidiary of the company that may be liable for the post august asbestos claims against abex has the benefit of that insurance 
abex has been in litigation since with the insurance carriers of its primary layer of liability concerning coverage for asbestos claims 
abex also has substantial excess layer liability insurance coverage which  barring unforeseen insolvencies of excess carriers or other adverse events  should provide coverage for asbestos claims against abex 
wagner also maintained product liability insurance coverage for some of the time that it manufactured products that contained asbestos 
the subsidiary of the company that may be liable for asbestos claims against wagner has the benefit of that insurance 
primary layer liability insurance coverage for asbestos claims against wagner is the subject of an agreement with wagner s solvent primary carriers 
the agreement provides for partial reimbursement of indemnity and defense costs for wagner asbestos claims until exhaustion of aggregate limits 
wagner also has substantial excess layer liability insurance coverage which  barring unforeseen insolvencies of excess carriers or other adverse events  should provide coverage for asbestos claims against wagner 
the ultimate exposure of the company s subsidiary with respect to claims against abex and wagner will depend upon the extent to which the insurance described above will be available to cover such claims  the amounts paid for indemnity and defense  changes in the legal environment and other factors 
while the company believes that the liability and receivable recorded for these claims are reasonable and appropriate  given the nature and complexity of factors affecting the estimated liability and potential insurance recovery  the actual liability and insurance recovery may differ 
in the event that the actual liability net of insurance proceeds recovered exceeds the reserve net of insurance receivable recorded by the company  the company s results of operations  business  liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the asbestos reserves for the businesses acquired as part of the cooper automotive acquisition will be re evaluated periodically as additional information becomes available 
federal mogul and fel pro asbestos litigation the company also is sued in its own name as one of a large number of defendants in a number of lawsuits brought by claimants alleging injury due to exposure to asbestos 
the company s fel pro subsidiary has been named as a defendant in a number of product liability cases involving asbestos  primarily involving gasket or packing products 
the company is defending all such claims vigorously and believes that it and fel pro have substantial defenses to liability and adequate insurance coverage for defense and indemnity 
while the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes that asbestos claims pending against the company and fel pro as of december   will not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
aggregate of asbestos liability as of december   the company has provided a total reserve for all of its subsidiaries and businesses with potential asbestos liability of approximately billion as its best estimate for future costs related to resolving asbestos claims 
the company estimates claims will be filed and paid in excess of the next years 
this estimate is based in part on recent and historical claims experience  medical information and the current legal environment 
the company has a corresponding receivable from certain insurance carriers of approximately million 
environmental matters the company is a defendant in lawsuits filed in various jurisdictions pursuant to the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of cercla or other similar federal or state management s discussion and analysis continued environmental laws which require responsible parties to pay for cleaning up contamination resulting from hazardous wastes which were discharged into the environment by them or by others to which they sent such wastes for disposition 
in addition  the company has been notified by the united states environmental protection agency and various state agencies that it may be a potentially responsible party prp under such law for the cost of cleaning up certain other hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities pursuant to cercla and other federal and state environmental laws 
prp designation requires the funding of site investigations and subsequent remedial activities 
at most of the sites that are likely to be costliest to clean up  which are often current or former commercial waste disposal facilities to which numerous companies sent waste  the company s exposure is expected to be limited 
despite the joint and several liability which might be imposed on the company under cercla and some of the other laws pertaining to these sites  the company s share of the total waste is usually quite small  the other companies which also sent wastes  often numbering in the hundreds or more  generally include large  solvent publicly owned companies  and in most such situations the government agencies and courts have imposed liability in some reasonable relationship to contribution of waste 
in addition  the company has identified certain present and former properties at which it may be responsible for cleaning up environmental contamination 
the company is actively seeking to resolve these matters 
although difficult to quantify based on the complexity of the issues  the company has accrued the estimated cost associated with such matters based upon current available information from site investigations and consultants 
the environmental reserve was approximately million at december   and million at december  the increase results from a number of factors  including retaining liabilities from the divestiture of the t n bearings business 
management believes that such accruals will be adequate to cover the company s estimated liability for its exposure in respect of such matters 
market risk in the normal course of business  the company is subject to market exposure from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and raw material prices 
to manage a portion of these inherent risks  the company purchases various derivative financial instruments and commodity futures contracts 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk a substantial portion of the company s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
the company manufactures and sells its products in north america  europe  south america  africa and asia 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
the company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the united states dollar and european currencies 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operation of the company s international businesses into united states dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
the company does not generally hedge operating translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
as of december  and  the company s net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk were million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in net assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million and million respectively 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
management s discussion and analysis continued the company manages certain aspects of its foreign currency activities and larger transactions through the use of foreign currency options or forwards 
the company generally tries to utilize natural hedges within its foreign currency activities  including the matching of revenues and costs 
as of december   the company had entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the british pound against the united states dollar and the euro against the united states dollar in the amount of million and million  respectively  with an average contract rate of pounds and euro 
the company had also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the british pound against the euro  french franc and italian lira in the amounts of million  million and million with average contract rates of euro pounds  franc pounds   lira pounds  respectively 
at december   the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts were not material 
as of december   the company had also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency debt exposures from the british pound to the australian dollar  belgium franc  czech koruna  dutch guilder  danish krone  german mark  irish punt  japanese yen  south african rand and spanish peseta whose notional amounts and related unrealized gains or losses were not material 
as of december   the company had entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the british pound against the united states dollar in the amount of million with an average contract rate of pounds and an unrealized loss of million at december  the company had also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the british pound against the south african rand in the amount of million with an average contract rate of rand pounds and an unrealized loss of million at december  as of december  the company had also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency debt exposures from the british pound to the australian dollar  swiss franc  german mark  danish krone  spanish peseta  french franc  hong kong dollar  italian lira  japanese yen and swedish krona whose notional amounts and related unrealized gains or losses were not material 
all foreign currency forward contracts purchased will expire within the next twelve months 
interest rate risk the company s variable interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates 
most of the company s interest expense is fixed through long term borrowings to mitigate the impact of such potential exposure 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates

as of december   the company had net unrealized gains for commodity contracts of million 
as of december   the company had net unrealized losses for commodity contracts of million 
other matters impact of year in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year compliant 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
as of december   the company incurred and expensed approximately million and capitalized million 
year program costs incurred during are not expected to be material and will be funded from operations 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
euro conversion on january   certain member countries of the european union irrevocably fixed the conversion rates between their national currencies and a common currency  the euro  which became their legal currency on that date 
the participating countries former national currencies continue to exist as denominations of the euro until january  the company has established a steering committee that is monitoring the business implications of conversion to the euro  including the need to adapt internal systems to accommodate euro denominated transactions 
the acquisition of t n has provided the company with a strong knowledge base in which to assist with the conversion 
while the company is still in various stages of assessment and implementation  the company does not expect the conversion to the euro to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis continued status of lighting  wiper and fuel businesses during the third quarter of  the company announced plans to sell its lighting  wiper blade and fuel systems businesses 
accordingly  the company accounted for these businesses as held for sale in its press release on february   and did not include pretax depreciation and amortization totaling million related to these businesses in its operating results at such time 
subsequent to the company s february  press release relative to fourth quarter and total year financial results  the company  in recognition of the market price available for the businesses held for sale and the continued profitability of these businesses  decided to retain its lighting  wiper blade and fuel systems businesses 
as a result  the million of depreciation and amortization is reflected in the fourth quarter and total year financial results 
restructuring program on february   the board of directors of the company approved a restructuring plan to reduce costs in the company s aftermarket and oe businesses 
under the restructuring plan  the company expects to incur restructuring charges of approximately million which it expects to incur over the next two years  the majority of which will be recognized in when specific actions are finalized 
the company will also incur an additional million in incremental expenses and capital expenditures associated with this plan that will be expensed or capitalized as incurred 
the majority of these expenses will occur in with the remainder over the subsequent two years 
as a result of this restructuring plan  the company may also take a non cash asset writedown of approximately million to adjust certain assets to their fair value 
the company anticipates recognizing the first of these charges in the first quarter of it is possible the company may identify additional areas of potential improvements requiring further restructuring plans
