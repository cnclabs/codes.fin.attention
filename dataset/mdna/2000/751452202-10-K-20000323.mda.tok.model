as of december  the company was in compliance with the covenant terms 
it is the company s intention to extend the credit facility  at rates that are commercially reasonable 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to repay or refinance its indebtedness on commercially reasonable or any other terms 
during august  the company executed an interest rate swap agreement to limit the company s exposure to increases in interest rates on its floating rate debt 
the notional amount of the agreement was  based on rates currently in effect under the company s credit facility  the agreement provides for a fixed rate of through october the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other parties to the interest rate swap agreement  however  the company does not anticipate non performance by the counter party 
after taking into account the impact of converting the variable rate debt into fixed rate debt by use of the rate protection agreement  the company s variable rate debt accounted for  of outstanding debt with a weighted average interest rate of 
variable rate debt accounted for approximately of the company s total debt and of its total capitalization 
based on the debt and the market value of equity  the company s debt to total market capitalization debt plus market value equity ratio was at december  the properties in which the operating partnership owns an interest and are accounted for on the equity method of accounting are subject to non recourse mortgage indebtedness

the company s current capital structure includes property specific mortgages  two construction loans  the unsecured term loan  the credit facility  series a preferred shares  common shares and a minority interest in the operating partnership 
currently  the minority interest in the operating partnership represents the ownership in the operating partnership which may  under certain conditions  be exchanged for  common shares 
as of december   op units issued are exchangeable for common shares of the company on a one for one basis 
the company  as sole general partner of the operating partnership  has the option to exchange op units for cash based on the current trading price of the company s common shares 
assuming the exchange of all limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and the exchange of series a preferred shares for  shares of common stock  there would be outstanding  common shares with a market value of approximately  at december  based on the closing price of per share on december  
the principal uses of the company s liquidity and capital resources are for acquisitions  development  including expansion and renovation programs  debt repayment and repurchase of its common stock 
to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  the company is required to distribute to its shareholders at least of its real estate investment trust taxable income as defined in the code 
the company anticipates that the combination of the availability under the credit facility  construction loans  the sale of existing properties  and potential new debt and equity offerings will provide the necessary capital to achieve continued growth 
the company anticipates adequate liquidity for the foreseeable future to fund future acquisitions  developments  expansions  repositionings  and to continue its currently planned capital programs  to repurchase up to million of the company s common stock and to make distributions to its shareholders in accordance with the code s requirements applicable to reits 
although the company believes that the combination of factors discussed above will provide sufficient liquidity  no such assurance can be given 
economic conditions substantially all of the leases at the company s properties provide for tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance and real estate taxes  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
many of the tenants leases contain provisions designed to lessen the impact of inflation 
such provisions include the ability to receive percentage rentals based on a tenant s gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years  which may enable the operating partnership to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base and or percentage rentals if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
the retail industry has experienced some financial difficulties during the past few years and certain local  regional and national retailers have filed for protection under bankruptcy laws 
if this trend should continue  the company s future earnings performance could be negatively impacted 
sensitivity analysis the company has exposure to interest rate risk on its debt obligations 
based on the company s interest in debt and interest rates in effect at december   a one percent increase in interest rates would decrease earnings and cash flows by approximately a one percent decrease in interest rates would increase earnings and cash flows by approximately  year prior to december   the company successfully completed its year assessment of all critical and non critical information systems 
the year issue did not adversely affect normal business operations and there was no material failure of the company s business operations subsequent to december  the costs associated with year testing and remediation have not had a material impact on the results of operations for the year ended december  funds from operations management generally considers funds from operations ffo to be one measure of financial performance of an equity reit 
it has been presented to assist investors in analyzing the performance of the company and to provide a relevant basis for comparison to other reits 
the company has adopted the most recent national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo  which was effective on january  under the nareit definition  ffo represents income loss before minority interest computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
therefore  ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of the ability to pay distributions 
furthermore  while net income and cash generated from operating  investing and financing activities determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consider capital expenditures which have been and will be incurred in the future  the calculation of ffo does not 
for periods beginning after december   nareit has clarified its definition that ffo should include both recurring and non recurring operating results  except for those items defined as extraordinary items under generally accepted accounting principles 
this clarification is not expected to have a material impact on the company s ffo the following table illustrates the calculation of ffo for the years ended december  and actual net income   less gain on sale of property  add depreciation and amortization   add minority interest in partnership   funds from operations diluted   less preferred share dividends   funds from operations basic   weighted average equivalent shares outstanding basic   diluted   supplemental disclosure straight line rental income   amortization of management contracts and covenants not to compete includes gain on sale of property of an unconsolidated entity

for diluted  represents the weighted average total shares outstanding  assuming the redemption of all operating partnership units for common shares  the series a preferred shares converted to common shares and the common shares issuable under the treasury stock method upon exercise of stock options 
capital expenditures during  the company spent approximately  on revenue generating capital expenditures including tenant allowances  leasing commissions paid to third party brokers  legal costs relative to lease documents  and capitalized leasing and construction costs 
these types of costs generate a return through rents from tenants over the term of their leases 
revenue enhancing capital expenditures  including expansions  renovations or repositionings were approximately  revenue neutral capital expenditures  such as roof and parking lot repairs  which are anticipated to be recovered from tenants  amounted to approximately  impact of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company will adopt sfas no 
as required for its first quarterly filing of fiscal year on december   the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which among other topics  establishes standards for when the lessor can recognize contingent rental income that is based on future specified targets within the lessor s fiscal year 
the sab concluded that contingent revenue should be recorded in the period in which the specified target that results in contingent rental income is achieved 
the company s policy has been to recognize percentage rents throughout the year based on rent estimated to be due from the tenant 
the company will adopt this change in the method of accounting as of january  and report the change of  of contingent rent receivables as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
