general overview the company was incorporated in to commercialize an automated credit processing system developed by james r 
defrancesco  the company s co founder  and scott l 
freiman  the company s president  chief executive officer and co founder  while they were employed by american financial corporation afc  an automobile finance servicing company owned by mr 
defrancesco 
afc was acquired in october by perpetual savings bank  fsb 
mr 
defrancesco and mr 
freiman retained ownership of afc s credit processing software which formed the basis for creditrevue 
creditrevue was initially released in since its initial release  the company has continually enhanced creditrevue in response to the needs of its customers 
creditconnection  the company s online credit information and processing service  became commercially available in july the dun bradstreet onescore product was commercially released in october  creditrevue service bureau was introduced in january  dun bradstreet portfolio monitoring was introduced in june and the creditonline network  was announced in february  in march  the company announced creditrevue maestro  an automated analysis engine for evaluating and decisioning consumer and small business credit applications 
during  the creditrevue maestro product was renamed evaluate 
the company currently expects evaluate to be released in q fees from licenses of creditrevue and related maintenance fees and resales of third party computer hardware and software associated with installations of creditrevue accounted for the majority of the company s revenue through december  see business risk factors dependence on creditrevue product line 
license fees for creditrevue are recognized based on a percentage of completion method  measured generally on a cost incurred basis 
the company typically charges a nonrefundable fee of of the preliminary estimate of the total license fee to develop an analysis of the customer s credit operations and a plan for the configuration and implementation of creditrevue according to the customer s requirements 
at the completion of this initial contract phase  clients decide to proceed with a software license and system implementation or they may opt to terminate the project 
historically  there have been very few projects terminated at the completion of the commencement phase of the project 
costs consist primarily of direct labor and temporary contract labor 
contracts in progress are reviewed periodically  and revenues and earnings are adjusted based on revisions in contract value and estimated costs to completion 
for a description of certain risks associated with the lengthy implementation time associated with installations of creditrevue  see business risk factors lengthy sales and implementation cycle 
the company recognizes revenue for maintenance fees pro rata over the term of the related agreement  which is generally one year 
maintenance fees received in advance of revenue recognition are included in deferred revenue 
in addition  as a convenience to its customers  the company offers third party computer hardware through various reseller arrangements 
however  neither third party hardware nor third party software sales are a focus of the company s overall marketing strategy 
for the year ended december   revenues from third party hardware and software sales accounted for and of total revenues  respectively 
revenues from resales of third party computer hardware and software are recognized at the time of shipment and installation  respectively 
certain of the company s products and services  including the creditconnection service  creditrevue service bureau and dun bradstreet s onescore  and the creditonline network are charged on a per transaction basis 
as a result  the company anticipates that transaction based revenue will represent an increasing proportion of the company s revenue 
the company s sales and marketing efforts will no longer be exclusively targeted at generating license based revenue but will be increasingly focused on generating transaction based revenue from prospective customers 
the company s anticipated future growth is based  in large part  on the success of these products and services and the transition to a transaction based revenue stream 
accordingly  the failure by the company to generate demand for the creditconnection service  dun bradstreet s onescore  dun bradstreet portfolio monitoring  creditonline network  evaluate  the occurrence of any significant technological problems  such as a system failure incurred prior to the implementation of a fully functioning back up computer system  any inadequacy of the company s business interruption insurance to cover costs associated with system failure or business interruptions  or the failure of the company to successfully manage the transition to a transaction based revenue stream would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business risk factors market acceptance of creditconnection  transition to transaction based revenue and system interruption and security risks  potential liability  possible lack of adequate insurance  and system inadequacy 
since  the company has continually invested in the development and introduction of new products  services and enhancements to its software 
research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred 
certain software development costs are capitalized subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
based on the company s current research and development process  technological feasibility is established upon completion of a detailed design 
the company intends to continue to expend substantial resources on developing new products and services and enhancements to its software to incorporate technological developments and satisfy evolving customer needs 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated subtotals not adjusted for rounding year ended december  percentages of total revenues revenues license and software development fees maintenance fees computer hardware sales service bureau fees costs and expenses cost of license and software development fees cost of maintenance fees cost of computer hardware sales cost of service bureau fees selling  general and administrative expenses research and development costs 
loss from operations other income interest income  net amortization of excess of assigned value of identifiable assets over the cost of an acquired interest 
net loss total revenues total revenues decreased from million in to million in and increased from million in to million from in the company s revenues are derived from four sources license and software development fees  maintenance fees  computer hardware sales  and service bureau fees 
the company s largest customers accounted for and of total revenues in and  respectively 
none of the company s customers accounted for or more of total revenues in or a large number of new license contracts late in along with growth in the company s professional consulting and service bureau revenues contributed to the significant year to year growth in total revenues from to license and software development fees creditrevue accounted for virtually all of the company s license and software development fee revenue through december  license and software development fees decreased from million in to million in  and increased from million in to million in the decrease in was the result of longer than expected sales cycles for the creditrevue product and certain contract disputes 
by late  sales performance improved as a result of signing new contracts for creditrevue with an aggregate contract value of approximately million 
work on these new contracts began in late and early with the completion of many of these projects running into late the year to year growth in license and software development fees was the result of increases from license related work of approximately and increases in professional consulting services of approximately million 
maintenance fees maintenance fees include fees from software maintenance agreements 
maintenance fees increased from million in to million in  and from million in to million in the growth in these revenues during the periods presented was the result of increased maintenance fees associated with the increased number of licenses of creditrevue outstanding during such periods 
enhancements to previously installed creditrevue systems performed by the company s professional consulting staff are also subject to maintenance and contribute to growth in maintenance revenues 
computer hardware sales computer hardware sales revenue decreased from million in to million in  and increased from million in to million in computer hardware sales revenue consists of revenues received from resales of third party hardware in connection with the license and installation of the company s software 
the fluctuation in such revenues during these periods is the result of customer purchase preferences for computer hardware systems 
in certain instances  creditrevue customers have volume discount arrangements with hardware resellers making them eligible for discounts greater than those offered by the company 
service bureau fees service bureau revenues originate from the creditconnection service transaction and interface fees  from dun bradstreet onescore and portfolio monitoring transaction fees and creditrevue service bureau fees 
creditconnection service related revenues increased from million in to million in and increased from million in to million in revenue increases are the result of increases in the number of dealers and lenders enrolled in the creditconnection service and the resulting growth in transaction volume 
at december there were approximately dealer s enrolled in the service compared to approximately dealers at december and approximately dealers at december as of december there were approximately lenders connected to the creditconnection service compared to at december and at december dun bradstreet related revenues increased to thousand in up from the thousand reported in which was up from thousand in the dun bradstreet onescore service was commercially released in the fourth quarter of and the portfolio monitoring service was released in june of the creditrevue service bureau was released in january  through a strategic alliance with anytime access  but did not go into full production until january accordingly  only nominal revenues were recorded in from creditrevue service bureau related services 
during creditrevue service bureau was implemented at m i data services which contributed to the growth in creditrevue service bureau revenues to thousand 
cost of license and software development fees cost of license and software development fees consist primarily of salaries and benefits for in house programmers and the cost of temporary contract labor 
cost of license and software development fees decreased from million in to million in  and decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of license and software development fees  cost of license and software development fees were  and in  and  respectively 
the cost of license and software fees as a percentage of license and software development fees over these periods is related to the fluctuation in the company s quarterly revenues and hourly labor costs associated with temporary contractors during periods in which the company experienced increased demand for its products 
with respect to temporary contractors  the company s costs on a full time equivalent basis for these contractors is generally twice the amount incurred by the company for its in house technical personnel 
in  the company increased internal staffing levels commensurate with the expected growth in revenues 
these increased staffing levels were expected to reduce the dependency on temporary contractors resulting in a corresponding increase in the margins related to these revenues 
however  while license related revenues increased in  the costs of increased staffing and temporary contractors exceeded revenue growth 
in efforts at staff reduction were curtailed by certain contract disputes and prolonged sales cycles 
the increase in contract sales in late created demand for the internal resources and enabled the company to better manage staff utilization resulting in lower implementation costs per revenue dollar 
the sales cycle for license software is often difficult to predict accurately 
the skills and knowledge required to perform the licensed software implementation requires the company to maintain certain levels of specialized staffing occasionally creating production capacity in excess of sales demand which can result in higher costs and lower margins 
costs of maintenance fees cost of maintenance fees consists primarily of personnel and related costs for customer maintenance and support 
cost of maintenance fees increased from million in to million in  and decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of maintenance fee revenue  cost of maintenance fees was  and in  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in the percentage of cost of maintenance fees to maintenance fee revenues in  and results from incremental increases in staffing for maintenance personnel as maintenance revenues have increased and improvements in staff utilization 
staffing utilization efficiencies will vary based on the timing and training of additions to maintenance staff personnel 
cost of computer hardware sales cost of computer hardware sales consists of i the company s cost of computer hardware resold to the company s customers that are licensing creditrevue and ii salaries and benefits for systems integration employees 
cost of computer hardware sales decreased from million in to million in  and increased from million in to million in as a percentage of computer hardware sales revenue  cost of computer hardware sales was  and in  and  respectively 
the dollar fluctuation in the cost of computer hardware sales reflects the fluctuation in computer hardware sales during the periods presented 
the company s margin on computer hardware sales fluctuates based on changes in product sales mix  volume discounts to significant customers and negotiated mark ups with customers 
in many instances  hardware revenues may not be large enough to offset both the direct cost and the hardware being sold as well as certain fixed costs associated with the salaries and benefits for systems integration employees thereby resulting in negative margins 
cost of service bureau revenues cost of service bureau fees consist primarily of personnel costs associated with the operation and support of the service bureau 
other costs of service bureau revenues include equipment rental expenses  communications network costs from third parties and hardware and software pass through expenses 
service bureau costs increased from million in to million in and decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of service bureau revenue  cost of service bureau sales was  and in  and  respectively 
of the three primary sources of service bureau revenues  the creditconnection service  dun bradstreet related services and creditrevue service bureau  only the creditconnection service was operational for all of  dun bradstreet came on line in as did the creditrevue service bureau 
the increases in service bureau costs in are related to increased staffing required for operations and support for these services and increased communication expenses associated with the expanding creditconnection service 
the decreases in service bureau costs in are related to improved staffing utilization and efficiencies related to the new data center operations which commenced production early in following the company s relocation to annapolis junction from columbia  maryland 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  and decreased from million in to million in the million increase during relates to one time expenses and reserves associated with the company s relocation to annapolis junction and increases in payroll costs  communications expenses  depreciation and other general sales and administrative expenses 
of the total increase  approximately million relate to facilities and equipment expenses 
in addition  due to the company s relocation in  a liability of approximately million was recorded to recognize future minimum lease payments due under leases for the company s former offices 
other one time charges include the write off of certain leasehold improvements of approximately million and certain lease termination fees and moving expenses of approximately million 
additionally  increases in communication and depreciation expenses represent approximately million of the increase 
payroll related expenses increased approximately million and the balance of the increase was in the area of general  selling and administrative expenses including advertising  travel  legal and accounting fees 
increases in payroll relate primarily to increases in sales and marketing staffing 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in was the of result of reductions to office expense approximately million  the non recurrence of one time expenses related to the company s relocation in approximately million and the year end write off of certain impaired assets approximately million 
the reduction in office expense relates to subleasing the company s former offices which resulted in the recovery of approximately million of the reserve recorded in research and development costs research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits of in house programmers 
these costs increased million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   due primarily to the addition of four programmers in the increased staffing was required to address a number of strategic development efforts underway during  including on going efforts for creditconnection  dun bradstreet portfolio monitoring  creditrevue service bureau and the evaluate projects 
during  all development activities were expensed 
during  approximately million of costs associated with the development of evaluate expenses were capitalized 
the capitalized expenses include the direct payroll costs of certain programmers and certain third party development expenses 
during approximately million of evaluate expenses were capitalized up from the million capitalized in resulting in lower year to year research and development expenses being recorded 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest income expense interest expense was million in and interest income was million in and decreased to million in 
the interest expense reported in and relates to borrowings under the company s line of credit and obligations under capital lease 
the interest income reported in and results from invested proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
income tax expense from its inception in until its reincorporation in delaware in november  the company had been treated for income tax purposes as a corporation subject to federal and state taxation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and comparable state laws 
as a result  for federal and state income tax purposes  the company s earnings had been taxed directly to the company s shareholders 
upon termination of the company s subchapter s status in november  the company determined the differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of its assets and liabilities  and recorded at that date the resulting deferred tax liability and income tax expense 
income tax amounts and balances are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million which will begin to expire in see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the company s income tax status 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its working capital needs and investments in property and equipment from operating cash flows and approximately million of net proceeds from the company s initial public offering completed in december during  and  the company s operations consumed cash of million  million and million  respectively 
this cash flow deficiency during and is primarily caused by operating losses and an increase in accounts receivable 
in  operating losses  and reductions in accounts payable are the elements having the greatest impact on net cash used in operations 
the company s cash used for investing activities consists principally of investments in property and equipment and capitalized software development costs 
during the years ended december   and  the company invested a total of million  million and million  respectively  in property and equipment and capitalized software development costs 
these investments were directly attributable to the company s growth in operations 
the company did not have any material commitments for the purchase of property and equipment at december  the company has relied principally on its bank line of credit and proceeds from its initial public offering completed in december for its financing needs 
the company received million of net proceeds from its initial public offering 
the company maintains a secured bank line of credit in the amount of million 
at december  there was an outstanding balance of approximately million on the line of credit 
the bank line of credit requires the bank s written consent prior to  among other things  i the payment of cash dividends  ii the company s engagement in a substantially different business activity  or iii the purchase by the company of any interest in another enterprise or entity 
the company currently anticipates that its available cash resources  expected cash flows from operations and its bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet its presently anticipated working capital  capital expenditure and debt repayment requirements through the company will be exploring alternatives for additional capital to further investments in expanding the creditonline network in the business to business market 
year compliance year issue the year issue is a result of computer programs which store or process date related information using only two digits to represent the year 
these programs may not be able to properly distinguish between a year in the s and a year in the s 
failure of these programs to distinguish between the two centuries could cause the programs to yield erroneous results or even to fail 
state of readiness the company recognizes the significance of the year issue and has implemented a formal year program to minimize the impact of the year on the company and its customers year program 
the year program addresses both information technology it and non it systems  for systems used by the company as well as those provided by the company to its customers 
non it systems are primarily used by the company in the operation of its facilities 
the year program is implemented by a year team which includes members from all levels of management and all functional areas of the company  as follows executive sponsor the executive sponsor works with the senior technology executive on budgeting and resources management and other major year issues  and reports on year program status to the executive management of the company as well as the board of directors 
senior technology executive the senior technology executive manages the project managers company wide 
issues relating to budgeting and resources are escalated to the senior technology executive 
the senior technology executive also has the authority to prioritize year tasks over other project tasks 
project managers company wide the project managers company wide share responsibility for determining the year tasks that need to be completed  and monitoring the completion of the tasks on schedule 
the project managers company wide are responsible for collecting  coordinating and disseminating information within the company about the year program and its status 
system project managers a project manager is assigned to each of the primary areas of the company 
each system project manager is responsible for ensuring that the year tasks relating to his her area are completed on schedule 
product project managers a project manager is assigned to each specific product 
each product project manager is responsible for ensuring that the year tasks relating to that specific product are completed on schedule 
system analysts system analysts review individual products to identify year issues 
developers developers perform coding modifications to address year issues 
testers testing is performed under the guidance of the quality services department to ensure that any year issues have been properly addressed 
individual members of the year team communicate frequently with respect to year issues 
during  the year team met as a group and reported status bi weekly 
during the year and beyond  the year team and subgroups of the year team will meet as needed to address specific issues 
the company has used employees of the company to identify and address year issues 
through the end of  the year program involved six basic stages inventory of all potentially affected software products and software related services  analysis of such products and services to identify any areas that require change or replacement  change or replacement of the identified areas  testing  implementation of the changes or replacements  and contingency plans 
because the company is not only a user of software products and software related services  but also provides software products and software related services to its customers  the company s year program addresses both software products and software related services used by the company and those provided by the company to its customers 
the company has established written year coding standards which have been distributed to the company s system analysts  developers and testers 
the company has also conducted training for its system analysts  developers and testers to ensure that they are familiar with the company s year coding standards 
for purposes of the year program  the company has classified into the following three major categories the software products and software related services provided by the company to its customers credit decisioning systems existing systems and new systems  e commerce systems  and service bureau systems 
credit decisioning systems existing 
for existing credit decisioning systems ie  systems which customers were using in production at the time the year program was applied to the system  the company performed the following activities the customer s credit decisioning system was analyzed to identify any year issues and to determine whether any modifications to the code were required 
the analysis was conducted in accordance with detailed procedures which were developed internally by the company for year analysis of its credit decisioning systems 
the year modifications were made 
the modifications were tested 
the customer also had an opportunity to test the modifications 
following the testing  the modifications were installed in the customer s system 
any enhancements to the customer s credit decisioning system since the completion of the procedures described in items above were developed and implemented by the company under its year coding standards 
as an extra safeguard  however  the company conducted a follow up year analysis of these enhancements 
credit decisioning systems new 
for new credit decisioning systems ie  systems which were not used by customers until after the year program was applied to the system  the company performed the following activities each new credit decisioning system started with a base system 
the base system was analyzed for year issues 
enhancements were made to the base system based on the functional specifications agreed to between the company and the customer  and the enhanced system was delivered to the customer for user acceptance testing 
before or concurrent with the user acceptance testing  the company reviewed the code enhancements for compliance with the company s year coding standards 
the company implemented required modifications on the test system at the company s site  and tested the modifications 
upon completion of testing of the changes by the company  the software changes were reported to the customer and installed in the customer s system for further testing by the customer 
with respect to any enhancements to the credit decisioning system after acceptance by the customer of the system  the company performed the enhancements in a test environment 
the enhancements were then analyzed and tested for year issues following the above approach 
e commerce systems 
for e commerce systems  the company performed the following activities the company analyzed the software programs supporting the e commerce system to identify any year issues and determine whether any modifications were required 
the company also coordinated with the vendor of any hardware and other equipment supporting the e commerce system to request year information regarding the applicable product and to determine whether any patches  upgrades or replacements were necessary 
the company also tested the third party product where necessary  appropriate and feasible 
any necessary modifications were made to the software programs supporting the e commerce system 
in addition  any necessary patches or upgrades to  or replacements of  third party products were installed 
the company analyzed and tested the modifications  patches  upgrades and replacements 
the company made the year version of the software programs supporting the e commerce system available to its customers in a year environment for testing of the modifications 
the customer scheduled the testing with the company 
the modifications  patches  upgrades and replacements were placed into production 
with respect to any subsequent enhancements to the e commerce system  the enhancements were performed in a test environment 
the enhancements were then analyzed and tested for year issues following the above approach prior to being placed into production 
service bureau systems 
for service bureau systems  the company performed the following activities the base service bureau system was analyzed for compliance with the company s year coding standards 
the year modifications were made 
the modifications were tested 
for any subsequent releases  the company analyzed the changes for compliance with the company s year coding standards 
the company made any required modifications to the code 
the company tested the modifications 
following the testing  the release was ready to be delivered to the customer 
infrastructure 
for products and systems used by the company internally  the company performed one or more of the following activities the company contacted the provider of the product or system in writing to request information regarding the year readiness of its product or system  and evaluated the response for reasonableness and acceptability  based on cmsi s knowledge of the product or system 
the company obtained year compliance information from the third party s web site and evaluated the response for reasonableness and acceptability based on the company s knowledge of the product or system 
the company tested the product or system where appropriate and possible 
for any third party products or systems that required modifications  the company worked with the vendor to ensure that the modifications were completed in an acceptable time frame 
as the company does not have any control over the third party providers of products and systems  the company cannot guarantee that such third party products and systems will not suffer any adverse effects due to the year in most cases  the software products and software related services provided by the company interface to third party systems 
in cases where a third party provided year interface specifications  the company developed  tested and implemented new interface code to comply with those specifications 
the year activities described above relating to credit decisioning systems  e commerce systems  service bureau systems and third party products and systems represent the standard procedures applied to the applicable system 
in certain circumstances  the company may have made changes to or deviated from these procedures 
as of december   the analysis  remediation  testing and implementation had been substantially completed for i the company s customers credit decisions systems  ii the software and systems comprising the company s e commerce systems  iii the company s service bureau customers systems  and iv the company s internal products and systems 
the company has not experienced any material disruption to its business associated with the year issue 
to the company s knowledge  none of the company s customers has experienced any material disruption to its business which has been associated with the year issue in connection with the company s products 
for the year and beyond  the company continues to code according to its year coding standards 
in addition  because system clocks are now in the year  all testing necessarily includes testing of dates in the year costs as of december   substantially all expenses were associated with the opportunity cost of time spent by employees of the company on the year program  particularly on the analysis  development  testing and implementation relating to software products and software related services provided to customers 
the company estimates that the opportunity cost incurred as of december  is approximately million 
this cost can be allocated as follows  to credit decisioning systems   to e commerce systems   to service bureau systems   to internal products and systems  and  to year program management  project oversight  and client and vendor communications 
the company s projected costs of the entire year program was million 
the company may continue to incur costs in the year and beyond to address specific year issues that may arise 
the company does not believe that any such costs shall be material 
risks if a product or service provided by the company is found to cause damage or injury to a customer of the company due to a failure of such product or service to operate without any adverse effect due to date related processing associated with the year  the company could be liable to such customer for a breach of warranty  depending on the specific contractual arrangement between the company and such customer 
although the company s contractual arrangement with each of its customers generally limits the company s liability to such customer  the company cannot accurately predict whether or to what extent any legal claims will be brought against the company  or whether the company will otherwise be adversely affected by such claims 
in addition  a failure by the company to make its products year compliant could result in a decrease in sales of the company s products  delays in the development of other of the company s products  an increase in the costs associated with year remediation  and an increase in litigation costs 
the year issue may also have an indirect effect on the company s business and operations to the extent that potential customers of the company may be using significant resources to address year issues  and therefore may have fewer resources to evaluate and purchase other products and services such as the products and services offered by the company 
if a material third party product or system which the company uses or interfaces to fails to operate properly due to the year  such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
contingency plans during the end of and the beginning of  the company s contingency plans consisted primarily of a dedicated year support staff with detailed escalation procedures to address year issues which could affect the company or its customers 
the company has implemented continuing procedures to ensure that in the event a problem is reported by a customer which may be year related  the problem will be escalated appropriately and reported to members of the year team to determine whether any other clients or systems may be affected by the same error and to take appropriate action 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the company invests its excess cash balances in cash equivalents and municipal  commercial and government agency obligations which are interest rate sensitive 
however  the maturities of these obligations is less than one year  mitigating their sensitivity to interest rates 
the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows is not material
