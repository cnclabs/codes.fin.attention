direct cost of revenues 
direct cost of revenues consists primarily of billable employee compensation and related payroll benefits  the cost of contractors assigned to revenue generating activities and other related expenses billable to clients 
direct cost of revenues as a percent of revenues was in  in and in the improvement in resulted from a mix of price increases and improved productivity 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits paid to office and corporate staff  as well as rent  marketing  and corporate overhead expenses 
as a percent of revenues  these expenses were in  in and in amortization of goodwill 
annual amortization of goodwill has increased from  in to million in as the company has completed additional acquisitions  and is further expected to substantially increase in as a result of the acquisition of policano manzo described above and in future assessment of recoverability and impairment of goodwill which follows below 
other income and expenses 
interest expense consists primarily of interest associated with the purchased businesses referred to above 
interest expense is also expected to increase substantially in as a result of the acquisition of policano manzo and the associated refinancing described above 
income taxes 
in and  principally as a result of some of the goodwill amortization not being deductible for income tax purposes  the company s effective tax rate increased to and  respectively  compared to in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rates during each of these years  and a summary of the components of the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities 
future assessment of recoverability and impairment of goodwill in connection with its various acquisitions  the company recorded goodwill  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over periods of to years  its estimated periods that the company will be benefited by such goodwill 
at december   the unamortized goodwill was million which represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
further  in connection with the acquisition of policano manzo described above  approximately million of goodwill was recorded which is being amortized over its estimated useful life of years 
on a pro forma basis at december   the approximately million of goodwill will represent nearly of total assets 
goodwill arises when an acquirer pays more for a business than the fair value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets 
for financial reporting purposes  goodwill and all other intangible assets are amortized over the estimated period benefited 
the company has determined the life for amortizing goodwill based upon several factors  the most significant of which are the relative size  historical financial viability and growth trends of the acquired companies and the relative lengths of time such companies have been in existence 
management of the company periodically reviews the company s carrying value and recoverability of unamortized goodwill 
if the facts and circumstances suggest that the goodwill may be impaired  the carrying value of such goodwill will be adjusted which will result in an immediate charge against income during the period of the adjustment and or the length of the remaining amortization period may be shortened  which will result in an increase in the amount of goodwill amortization during the period of adjustment and each period thereafter until fully amortized 
once adjusted  there can be no assurance that there will not be further adjustments for impairment and recoverability in future periods 
of the various factors to be considered by management of the company in determining whether goodwill is impaired  the most significant will be i losses from operations  ii loss of customers  and iii industry developments  including the company s inability to maintain its market share  development of competitive products or services  and imposition of additional regulatory requirements 
liquidity and capital resources the company in generated million of cash flow from operations  an improvement of million as compared to this increase is attributable to an increase in net income excluding non cash charges principally depreciation and amortization of million  and the favorable net cash effects of changes in working capital balances 
the company expects that cash flows from operations will increase in  in part as a result of additional operating cash provided from businesses acquired in late and the acquisition of policano manzo described above 
to finance the p m transaction  the company entered into a senior credit facility  consisting of a million amortizing term loan maturing through january   initially bearing interest at libor plus specified margins ranging from to which margins may decline based on the company s leverage ratio a million revolving credit facility not initially drawn down bearing interest at prime plus which may also decline based on the company s leverage ratio  and a million subordinated debt facility with a group of lenders maturing january   bearing cash interest of and payable in kind pik 
the credit facilities are secured by all assets of the company 
the company is also required to comply with certain specified financial covenants related to operating performance and liquidity at the end of each quarter  and is further required to obtain interest rate protection on a minimum of of the million term loan 
the company believes that it will be in compliance with all covenants throughout proceeds of the facilities  together with approximately million of the company s existing cash  were used for the purchase and to refinance the company s existing debt of approximately million described below 
additionally the company issued  shares of its common stock to retire approximately million of notes outstanding to certain members of the senior management team whose businesses were acquired by the company in prior transactions 
in connection with the issuance of the subordinated debt  the holders were issued warrants to purchase approximately  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants expire ten years from the date of closing 
in addition  the company cancelled warrants for  shares of common stock issued in march in connection with its existing subordinated debt of million which was repaid as part of this refinancing 
in the company had borrowed million under its million long term credit facility with a bank to provide the million of cash needed to acquire klick  kent allen  inc  kahn consulting  inc  and sea  inc 
this credit facility was renegotiated in march  and was repaid on february  the company in march issued million of subordinated debentures which were also repaid on february  in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses in and  the company was obligated under certain seller notes totaling million at december  of the million outstanding at december   million was repaid during the refinancing on february  and approximately million was exchanged for common stock 
the company believes that cash generated from operations will allow it to meet its obligations that mature in and thereafter under its credit facility  and further provide for the necessary cash resources required in the near term to fund its expanding operations 
the company will also explore appropriate opportunities to raise equity capital to repay such obligations in whole or part prior to maturity 
during the company expended million for additions to property and equipment 
this amount included expenditures for internal information systems that allow the company to better manage its expanding operations 
at december   the company had no material commitments for the acquisition of property and equipment 
year compliance during  the company implemented a four stage process to assure year compliance of all hardware  software  and ancillary equipment that are date dependent 
the company completed all four phases and believes that the year issue did not and will not cause us any significant operational problems

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   million of the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates

assuming the current level of borrowings and assuming a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates under the company s long term bank credit facility for one year  the company s interest expense would increase by approximately  and net income would decrease by approximately  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure

further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
