item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a health care services company focused on acquiring and operating hospitals in attractive non urban markets in the united states 
as of december   we owned and operated general acute care hospitals in eight states with a total of  licensed beds  and managed hospitals in states  plus puerto rico  with a total of  licensed beds 
in addition  in february  we entered into a long term lease agreement for the city of ennis hospital  a bed acute care facility located in ennis  texas 
our company was founded in february by golder  thoma  cressey  rauner fund iv  lp and martin s 
rash to acquire and operate hospitals in attractive non urban markets 
we acquired our first hospital  memorial mother frances hospital in palestine  texas  in july in december  we acquired brim  inc in a transaction accounted for as a reverse acquisition 
therefore  the assets and liabilities of brim were recorded at fair value as required by the purchase method of accounting  and the operations of brim were reflected in the operations of the combined enterprise from the date of acquisition 
because we had been in existence for less than a year at december   and because brim had been in existence for several years  we are considered the successor to brim s operations 
impact of acquisitions and divestitures an integral part of our strategy is to acquire non urban acute care hospitals 
because of the financial impact of our recent acquisitions  it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between our financial statements for the fiscal periods presented 
in addition  due to the relatively small number of owned and leased hospitals  each hospital acquisition can materially affect our overall operating performance 
upon the acquisition of a hospital  we typically take a number of steps to lower operating costs 
the impact of such actions may be offset by cost increases to expand services  strengthen medical staff and improve market position 
the benefits of these investments and of other activities to improve operating margins generally do not occur immediately 
consequently  the financial performance of a newly acquired hospital may adversely affect overall operating margins in the near term 
as we make additional hospital acquisitions  we expect that this effect will be mitigated by the expanded financial base of existing hospitals and the allocation of corporate overhead among a larger number of hospitals 
we may also divest certain hospitals in the future if we determine a hospital no longer fits within our strategy 
acquisition in august  we acquired colorado river medical center in needles  california by purchasing certain assets and assuming certain liabilities and entering into a fifteen year lease agreement  with three five year renewal options  for a purchase price of approximately million 
the results of operations include five months of operations for colorado river medical center 
acquisitions in may  we acquired lake havasu regional medical center in lake havasu city  arizona  for approximately million 
in june  we acquired elko general hospital in elko  nevada for a purchase price of approximately million 
to finance these acquisitions  we borrowed million and million  respectively  under our revolving credit facility 
the results of operations include twelve months of operations for the acquisition in  plus eight months of operations for lake havasu regional medical center and six and one half months of operations for elko general hospital 
acquisitions in february  we entered into a special services agreement for the lease of eunice community medical center in eunice  louisiana by purchasing certain assets totaling million and assuming certain liabilities and entering into a ten year lease agreement  with a five year renewal option  totalling million 
in april  we acquired the assets of glades general hospital in belle glade  florida totaling million and assumed liabilities totaling million 
to finance this acquisition  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility 
in june  we acquired the assets totaling million and assumed liabilities totaling million of doctors hospital of opelousas in opelousas  louisiana 
to finance this acquisition  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility 
in october  we acquired the assets totaling million and assumed liabilities totaling million of trinity valley medical center in palestine  texas and minden medical center in minden  louisiana 
to finance the acquisition  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility 
following the acquisition  we merged trinity valley medical center into memorial mother frances hospital  a hospital that we already owned in palestine  texas  and changed the name of the hospital to palestine regional medical center 
the results include twelve months of operations for the acquisitions in and  ten months and six days of operations for eunice community medical center  eight and one half months of operations for glades general hospital  seven months of operations for doctors hospital of opelousas  and three months of operations for trinity valley medical center and minden medical center 
all the acquisitions described above were accounted for as purchase business combinations  and the results of operations of the hospitals have been included in our results of operations from the purchase dates forward 
recent acquisitions in february  we entered into a long term lease agreement for the city of ennis hospital in ennis  texas by entering into a year lease agreement 
the aggregate rental payments required under the long term lease total million 
general the federal medicare program accounted for approximately  and of hospital patient days in  and  respectively 
the state medicaid programs accounted for approximately  and of hospital patient days in  and  respectively 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are prospective  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
the medicare payment rate increases historically have been less than actual inflation 
both federal and state legislators are continuing to scrutinize the health care industry for the purpose of reducing health care costs 
while we are unable to predict what  if any  future health reform legislation may be enacted at the federal or state level  we expect continuing pressure to limit expenditures by governmental health care programs 
the balanced budget act of imposed certain limitations on increases in the inpatient medicare rates paid to acute care hospitals 
payments for medicare outpatient services provided at acute care hospitals and home health services historically have been paid based on costs  subject to certain limits 
the balanced budget act of requires that the payment for those services be converted to a prospective payment system  which will be phased in over time 
the balanced budget act of also includes a managed care option that could direct medicare patients to managed care organizations 
further changes in the medicare or medicaid programs and other proposals to limit health care spending could have a material adverse impact upon the health care industry and our company 
some of our acute care hospitals  like most acute care hospitals in the united states  have significant unused capacity 
the result is substantial competition for patients and physicians 
inpatient utilization continues to be affected negatively by payor required pre admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
we expect increased competition and admission constraints to continue in the future 
the ability to respond successfully to these trends  as well as spending reductions in governmental health care programs  will play a significant role in determining the ability of our hospitals to maintain their current rate of net revenue growth and operating margins 
we expect the industry trend in increased outpatient services to continue because of the increased focus on managed care and advances in technology 
outpatient revenue of our owned or leased hospitals was approximately  and of gross patient service revenue in  and  respectively 
the billing and collection of accounts receivable by hospitals are complicated by the complexity of the medicare and medicaid regulations  increases in managed care  hospital personnel turnover  the dependence of hospitals on physician documentation of medical records  and the subjective judgment involved 
there can be no assurance that this complexity will not negatively impact our future cash flows or results of operations 
the federal government and a number of states are rapidly increasing the resources devoted to investigating allegations of fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs 
at the same time  regulatory and law enforcement authorities are taking an increasingly strict view of the requirements imposed on providers by the social security act and medicare and medicaid regulations 
although we believe that we are in material compliance with such laws  a determination that we have violated such laws  or even the public announcement that we were being investigated concerning possible violations  could have a material adverse effect on our company 
our historical financial trend has been impacted favorably by our success in acquiring acute care hospitals 
while we believe that trends in the health care industry described above may create possible future acquisition opportunities  there can be no assurances that we can continue to maintain our current growth rate through hospital acquisitions and successfully integrate the hospitals into our system 
our owned and leased hospitals accounted for  and of our net operating revenue in  and  respectively 
we currently own four hospitals in california  which accounted for  and of net operating revenue in  and  respectively 
this concentration of results of operations in this market increases the risk that adverse developments at these facilities  or in the economic  regulatory or industry environment in california  could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
resolution of matters  for example  final settlements with third party payors  may result in changes from those estimates 
the timing and amount of such changes in estimates may cause fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  information expressed as a percentage of net operating revenue 
such information has been derived from our consolidated statements of income included elsewhere in this report 
the results of operations for the periods presented include hospitals from their acquisition dates  as previously discussed 
year ended december  net operating revenue operating expenses ebitda depreciation and amortization interest minority interest income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income operating expenses represent expenses before interest  minority interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda represents the sum of income before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization  minority interest  and loss gain on sale of assets 
we understand that industry analysts generally consider ebitda to be one measure of the financial performance of a company that is presented to assist investors in analyzing the operating performance of a company and its ability to service debt 
we believe that an increase in ebitda level is an indicator of our improved ability to service existing debt  to sustain potential future increases in debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
ebitda  however  is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing  or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
given that ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
hospital revenues are received primarily from medicare  medicaid and commercial insurance 
the percentage of revenues received from the medicare program is expected to increase due to the general aging of the population 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are based on a prospective payment system  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
while these rates are indexed for inflation annually  the increases have historically been less than actual inflation 
in addition  states  insurance companies and employers are actively negotiating the amounts paid to hospitals as opposed to their standard rates 
the trend toward managed care  including health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and various other forms of managed care  may affect the hospitals ability to maintain their current rate of net revenue growth 
net operating revenue is comprised of net patient service revenue from our owned and leased hospitals  management and professional services revenue  and other revenue 
net patient service revenue is reported net of contractual adjustments and policy discounts 
the adjustments principally result from differences between the hospitals customary charges and payment rates under the medicare  medicaid and other third party payor programs 
customary charges generally have increased at a faster rate than the rate of increase for medicare and medicaid payments 
operating expenses of the hospitals primarily consist of salaries and benefits  purchased services  supplies  provision for doubtful accounts and other operating expenses  principally consisting of utilities  insurance  property taxes  travel  freight  postage  telephone  advertising  repairs and maintenance 
management and professional services revenue is comprised of fees from management and professional consulting services provided to third party hospitals pursuant to management contracts and consulting arrangements 
management and professional services revenue plus reimbursable expenses totals less than of consolidated net operating revenue 
operating expenses for the management and professional services business primarily consist of salaries and benefits and reimbursable expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenue increased from in to in  an increase of million or 
net patient service revenue generated by hospitals owned during both periods  including palestine regional medical center  increased million  or  resulting from inpatient and outpatient volume increases  new services and price increases 
cost report settlements and the filing of cost reports resulted in positive revenue adjustments of million  or of net operating revenue  in  and million  on of net revenues in the remaining increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of additional hospitals in and operating expenses increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in to million  or of net operating revenue in the increase in operating expenses of hospitals owned during both periods resulted primarily from new services  volume increases  change in case mix and increased recruiting expenses  offset by a decrease in provision for doubtful accounts 
the majority of the increase in operating expenses was attributable to the acquisition of additional hospitals in and ebitda increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in to million  or of net operating revenue  in depreciation and amortization expense increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in  to million  or of net operating revenue in the increase in depreciation and amortization resulted primarily from the acquisitions in and a full year of expense for acquisitions made in interest expense as a percent of net operating revenue decreased from in to in income before provision for income taxes was million in  compared to million in  an increase of million or

net income was million  or of net operating revenue  in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
net patient service revenue generated by hospitals owned during both periods increased million  or in  primarily as a result of higher volumes and price increases  partially offset by increased managed care and charity care discounts and the effects of the balanced budget act of cost report settlements and the filing of cost reports during the year resulted in positive revenue adjustments of million  or of net patient service revenue  in and million  or of net patient service revenue  in the remaining increase of million was primarily attributable to the acquisition of additional hospitals in and operating expenses increased from million in  to million in  an increase of million or 
operating expenses were of net operating revenue in  compared to in the increase in operating expenses of hospitals owned during both periods resulted from volume increases  increased services and change in case mix  offset by decreased expenses in home health as a result of the balanced budget act of  and decreased expenses from the closing of two geriatric psychiatric units 
the majority of the increase in operating expenses was attributable to the acquisition of additional hospitals in and ebitda was million  or of net operating revenue in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue in the increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of additional hospitals in and depreciation and amortization expense was million  or of net operating revenue in compared to million  or of net operating revenue  in the increase in depreciation and amortization resulted from the acquisition of additional hospitals in and and increased capital expenditures 
interest expense as a percent of net operating revenue decreased from in to in income before income taxes was million in  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of additional hospitals in our provision for income taxes was million in  compared to million in these provisions reflect effective income tax rates of in  compared to in see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding differences between effective tax rates and statutory rates 
net income was million  or of net operating revenue in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of million 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december   and to at december  total long term obligations increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase resulted primarily from the borrowings to finance the acquisition of additional hospitals in on september   we increased the size of our credit facility to million  including a million revolving line of credit and a million end loaded lease facility 
at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving line of credit and million available  which includes availability under the end loaded lease facility that can be converted to revolver availability at our option 
our credit facility contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness including contingent obligations  sell material assets  retire  redeem or otherwise reacquire our capital stock  acquire the capital stock or assets of another business  and pay dividends 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain a specified net worth and meet or exceed certain coverage  leverage  and indebtedness ratios 
indebtedness under our credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
we are required under our credit facility to pay certain commitment fees  based upon amounts borrowed and available for borrowing  during the term of our agreement 
interest rate swap agreements are used to manage our interest rate exposure under our credit facility 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converted for a five year period million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converted for a five year period million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
we secured a fixed interest rate on the swap agreement  and a fixed interest rate on the swap agreement 
cash used in operations was million in and million in  and cash provided by operations was million in cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in  relating primarily to acquisitions and capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  relating primarily to net proceeds from long term debt and issuance of preferred stock 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  relating primarily to our initial public offering and our follow on equity offering and the application of the proceeds  and net borrowings to finance acquisitions 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  relating primarily to net borrowings to finance acquisitions 
we intend to acquire additional acute care facilities  and are actively seeking out such acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that we will not require additional debt or equity financing for any particular acquisition 
also  we continually review our capital needs and financing opportunities and may seek additional equity or debt financing for our acquisition program or other needs 
capital expenditures in and  were million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for the owned hospitals may vary from year to year depending on facility improvements and service enhancements undertaken by the hospitals 
we expect to make total capital expenditures in of approximately million  exclusive of any acquisitions of businesses or construction projects 
planned capital expenditures for consist principally of capital improvements to owned and leased hospitals 
we expect to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
with respect to construction projects  we have started construction of a replacement facility for elko general hospital  currently expected to cost approximately million  and if pre determined operating levels are achieved  we have agreed to build replacement facilities for eunice community medical center  currently expected to cost approximately million  and glades general hospital  currently expected to cost approximately million 
we cannot estimate whether and when each hospital will achieve its individual pre determined operating levels  but we believe it will take approximately thirty six months to complete construction from such date 
we have started construction on an ancillary expansion at lake havasu regional medical center  which is expected to cost approximately million 
in addition  in connection with certain acquisitions we have made  we have committed and may commit in the future to spend specified amounts for capital expenditures 
impact of year issues in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we expensed approximately million during in connection with remediating our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our services  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued  and was required to be adopted in years beginning after june  in june  sfas no 
was issued  deferring the effective date of sfas no 
for one year 
this statement requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
this results in the offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of both the hedge and the hedged item being recognized in earnings in the same period 
changes in fair value of derivatives not meeting the statement s hedge criteria are included in income 
we expect to adopt the new statement january   and do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
inflation the health care industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase  especially during periods of inflation and labor shortages 
in addition  suppliers pass along to us rising costs in the form of higher prices 
we generally have been able to offset increases in operating costs by increasing charges for services  expanding services  and implementing cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
in light of cost containment measures imposed by government agencies and private insurance companies  we are unable to predict our ability to offset or control future cost increases  or our ability to pass on the increased costs associated with providing health care services to patients with government or managed care payors  unless such payors correspondingly increase reimbursement rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk involves interest rate risk 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of u 
s 
interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in u 
s 
interest rates  we generally expect to maintain a substantial percent of its debt as fixed rate in nature by entering into interest rate swap transactions 
the million of aggregate interest rate swap agreements  entered into in and  are contracts to exchange periodically fixed and floating interest rate payments over the lives of the agreements 
the floating rate payments are based on libor and fixed rate payments are dependent upon market levels at the time the swap agreement was consummated 
the interest rate swap agreements do not constitute positions independent of the underlying exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage features 
the swap agreements allow the counterparty a one time option at the end of the initial term to cancel the agreement or extend the swaps for an incremental time period 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instruments 
the counterparties are creditworthy financial institutions  and we expect our counterparties to fully satisfy their contract obligations 
we received a weighted average rate of  and  and paid a weighted average rate of  and on our interest rate swap agreements  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the carrying amount of our total debt of million and million at december  and  respectively  approximated fair value 
we had million and million of variable rate debt outstanding at december  and  respectively  with interest rate swaps in place to offset the variability of million of this balance in and at this borrowing level  a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates  considering the effect of the interest rate hedge agreements  would have an unfavorable impact on our net income and cash flows of approximately million in and million in a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates on the fixed rate debt would not have a material impact on the fair value of such debt
