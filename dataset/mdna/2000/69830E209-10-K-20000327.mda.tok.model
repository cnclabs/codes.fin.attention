the company will not be required to pay interest on the notes until august   which management believes will assist the company in implementing its strategy 
panavision currently anticipates that in order to pay the principal amount at maturity of the notes or upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the notes  to redeem the notes or to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined in the notes  panavision will be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as seeking capital contributions or loans from its affiliates  refinancing its indebtedness or selling its equity securities 
none of the affiliates of the company will be required to make any capital contributions or other payments to the company with respect to the company s obligations on the notes  and the obligations of the company with respect to the notes will not be guaranteed by any affiliate of the company or any other person 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing actions could be effected on satisfactory terms  that they would be sufficient to enable the company to make any payments in respect of the notes when required or that any of such actions would be permitted by the terms of the indenture or the debt instruments of panavision then in effect 
panavision is a holding company whose only material asset is the capital stock of and partnership interests in its subsidiaries 
panavision s principal business operations are conducted by its subsidiaries  and panavision has no operations of its own 
accordingly  panavision s only source of cash to pay its obligations is expected to be distributions with respect to its ownership interests in its subsidiaries 
there can be no assurance that panavision s subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay dividends or distribute funds to panavision or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions  including negative covenants contained in the debt instruments of such subsidiaries  will permit such dividends or distributions 
seasonality the company s revenue and net income are subject to seasonal fluctuations experienced primarily in the first and second calendar quarters

in north america  episodic television programs cease filming in the second quarter for several months  and typically resume production in august 
impact of inflation the company s results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to measure accurately the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required  the company believes that the effects of inflation  if any  on its results of operations and financial condition have been minor 
market risk panavision is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  which could impact its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
as of december  and  panavision s primary net foreign currency market exposures include the euro  british pound  french franc  canadian dollar  australian dollar and the new zealand dollar 
at the present time  the company does not generally hedge against foreign currency fluctuation 
management does not foresee nor expect any significant changes in foreign currency exposure in the near future 
as of december  and  a appreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the prevailing market rates would increase the related net unrealized gain by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a depreciation in these currencies from the prevailing market rates would decrease the related net unrealized gain by million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rates applicable to and would have resulted in an increase to interest expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
conversely  a hypothetical decrease in the interest rates applicable to and would have decreased interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   the company believes that the carrying value of its amounts payable under the credit agreement approximate fair value based upon current yields for debt issues of similar quality and terms 
the fair value of panavision s fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
based upon a hypothetical increase in the interest rate and assuming all other conditions affecting market risk remain constant  the market value of the company s fixed rate debt would be impacted by a decrease of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
conversely  a hypothetical decrease in the interest rate and assuming all other conditions affecting market risk remain constant  would result in an increase in market value of approximately million and million over the same period 
management does not foresee nor expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how such exposure is managed in the future 
panavision manages its fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
to manage this mix in a cost effective manner  the company  from time to time  enters into interest rate swap agreements  in which it agrees to exchange various combinations of fixed and or variable interest rates based upon agreed upon notional amounts 
panavision had no interest rate swap agreements in effect at december  management does not foresee nor expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how such exposure is managed

the company has incurred approximately  of costs associated with upgrading its systems to be year compliant  of which approximately  has been capitalized 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting form year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties
