since actual results for only reflect the operations of mci after september   and eleven months of compuserve network services and ans  the pro forma results are more indicative of internal growth for the combined company 
the pro forma revenues  excluding embratel  for the years ended december  and  reflect the following changes by category dollars in millions actual pro forma percent change revenues voice   data   internet   international   communication services   messaging other  total revenues   the following discusses the revenue increases for the year ended december   as compared to pro forma results for the comparable prior year period 
the pro forma revenues assume that the mci merger  compuserve merger and the aol transaction occurred at the beginning of these pro forma revenues do not include embratel or the imci business that was sold 
changes in actual results of operations are shown in the consolidated statements of operations and the foregoing tables and  as noted above  primarily reflect the mci merger  embratel acquisition and internal growth of the company 
voice revenues include both long distance and local domestic switched revenues 
voice revenues for experienced a increase over the prior year pro forma amount  driven by a gain of in traffic as a result of customers purchasing all distance voice services from the company 
aggressive pricing in both consumer and business markets also contributed to this favorable performance  as traffic volume gains more than offset pricing declines 
these volume and revenue gains were offset partially by anticipated year over year declines in carrier wholesale traffic as well as federally mandated access charge reductions that were passed through to the consumer 
voice revenues include both long distance and local domestic switched revenues 
data revenues for increased over the same pro forma period of the prior year 
data includes both long distance and local dedicated bandwidth sales 
the revenue growth for data services continued to be driven by significant commercial end user demand for high speed data and by internet related growth on both a local and long haul basis 
this growth was not only fueled by connectivity demands  but also by applications that have become more strategic  far reaching and complex  additionally  bandwidth consumption drove an acceleration in growth for higher capacity circuits 
as of december   the company had approximately million domestic local voice grade equivalents and over  buildings in the united states connected over its high capacity circuits 
domestic local route miles of connected fiber exceeded  and domestic long distance route miles exceeded  as of december  internet revenues for increased over the prior year pro forma amount 
growth was driven by both dial up and dedicated connectivity to the internet as more and more business customers migrated their data networks and applications to internet based technologies 
the company has increased the capacity of its global internet network to oc in response to the increasing backbone transport requirements of both its commercial and wholesale accounts 
the company s dial access network has grown over to million modems  compared with the same period in the prior year 
mci s internet revenues for have been excluded from the above table  due to the divestiture of the imci business 
international revenues those revenues originating outside of the united states  excluding embratel for were billion  an increase of as compared with billion for the same pro forma period of the prior year 
the company has continued to extend the reach of its end to end networks which now provides mci worldcom the capability to connect approximately  buildings in europe all over its own high capacity circuits 
messaging revenues coming from skytel increased to million in compared with million for the prior year period 
other revenues  which primarily consist of the operations of shl  for were million  a decrease of versus billion for the pro forma period of the prior year 
in april  the company completed the sale of shl to eds for billion 
the following discusses the actual results of operations for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  line costs 
line costs as a percentage of revenues for were as compared to reported for the same period in the prior year 
overall decreases are attributable to changes in the product mix and synergies and economies of scale resulting from network efficiencies achieved from the continued assimilation of mci  compuserve network services and ans into the company s operations 
additionally  access charge reductions that occurred in january and july reduced total line cost expense by approximately million for while access charge reductions were primarily passed through to customers  line costs as a percentage of revenues were positively affected by over half a percentage point for the principal components of line costs are access charges and transport charges 
regulators have historically permitted access charges to be set at levels that are well above ilecs costs 
as a result  access charges have been a source of universal service subsidies that enable local exchange rates to be set at levels that are affordable 
mci worldcom has actively participated in a variety of state and federal regulatory proceedings with the goal of bringing access charges to cost based levels and to fund universal service using explicit subsidies funded in a competitively neutral manner 
mci worldcom cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or whether or not the result s will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  the company s goal is to manage transport costs through effective utilization of its network  favorable contracts with carriers and network efficiencies made possible as a result of expansion of the company s customer base by acquisitions and internal growth 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were billion or of revenues as compared to billion or of revenues for the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for reflects the assimilation of mci into the company s strategy of cost control 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased to billion or of revenues from billion or of revenues for this increase reflects increased amortization and depreciation associated with the mci merger  compuserve merger and aol transaction as well as additional depreciation related to capital expenditures 
as a percentage of revenues  these costs decreased due to the higher revenue base 
in process research and development and other charges 
in  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in connection with the bfp merger  the mci merger and certain asset write downs and loss contingencies 
such charges included million for employee severance  million for bfp direct merger costs  million for conformance of bfp accounting policies  million for exit costs under long term commitments  million for write down of a permanently impaired investment and million related to certain asset write downs and loss contingencies 
the million related to long term commitments includes million of minimum commitments between and for leased facilities that the company has or will abandon  million related to certain minimum contractual network lease commitments that expire between and  for which the company will receive no future benefit due to the migration of traffic to owned facilities  and million of other commitments 
because of organizational and operational changes that occurred  management concluded in that certain leased properties would not be abandoned according to the original plan that was approved by management 
therefore  in a reversal of a million charge to in process research and development ipr d and other charges was recorded in connection with this plan amendment 
additionally  the million related to certain asset write downs and loss contingencies includes million for the decommission of certain information systems that have no alternative future use  million for the write down to fair value of certain assets held for sale that were disposed of in and million related to legal costs and other items related to bfp 
as of december  and  the company s remaining unpaid liability related to the above charges was million and million  respectively 
in connection with certain business combinations  the company made allocations of the purchase price to acquired ipr d totaling million in the first quarter of related to the compuserve merger and aol transaction and billion in the third quarter of related to the mci merger 
these allocations represent the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted future cash flows related to the incomplete projects 
at the date of the respective business combinations  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the r d in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the respective acquisition dates 
the value of the ipr d projects reflected the r d s stage of completion as of the acquisition date  the complexity of the work completed to date  the difficulty of completing the remaining development  costs already incurred and the projected cost to complete the projects 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the contribution of the purchased in process technology to developing commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the expected product sales of such products  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
a description of the acquired in process technology and the estimates made by the company at the time each business combination was completed is set forth below 

mci 
the in process technology acquired in the mci merger consisted of seventy significant r d projects grouped into six categories 
the aggregate value assigned to mci ipr d was billion 
these projects were all targeted at developing and deploying an all optical network  new architecture of the telephone system using internet protocol ip and developing the systems and tools necessary to manage the voice and data traffic  creating new products and services  and developing certain information systems that may enhance the management of mci worldcom s products and service offerings 
as of the allocation date  total mci stand alone revenues were projected to exceed billion within five years 
this level of revenue implied a compound annual growth rate cagr of approximately 
estimated total revenues from the acquired in process technology peaked in the year and steadily declined in through as other new product and service technologies were expected to be introduced by the combined company 
as of the mci merger date approximately million had been spent on developing the ipr d 
estimated costs to complete were approximately million  as follows during the last quarter of  during the four quarters in  during the four quarters in  and during the four quarters in the allocation of purchase price for the mci merger included an allocation to developed technology  which is being depreciated over years on a straight line basis 
the remaining purchase price  which includes allocations to goodwill and tradename  is being amortized over years on a straight line basis 

compuserve and ans 
the in process technology acquired in the compuserve merger and the aol transaction consisted of three main r d efforts underway at compuserve network services and two main r d efforts underway at ans 
the aggregate value assigned to compuserve and ans in process technology was million 
these projects included next generation network technologies and new value added networking applications  such as applications hosting  multimedia technologies and virtual private data networks 
at the time of the allocation  total ans and compuserve network services stand alone revenues were projected to exceed billion within five years 
this level of revenues implied a cagr of approximately 
estimated total revenues from the acquired in process technology related to compuserve network services peaked in the year and steadily declined through as other new product and service technologies were expected to be introduced by the company 
estimated total revenues from the acquired in process technology related to ans peaked in the year and steadily declined through based on the cost incurred at the acquisition dates and the milestones achieved by ans and compuserve network services  in aggregate  ans projects were estimated to be approximately complete  while compuserve network services projects were estimated to be approximately complete 
estimated costs to complete were approximately million  as follows during the last three quarters of  and during the four quarters in the allocation of purchase price for the compuserve merger and the aol transaction included allocations to developed technologies  assembled work force  customer relationships and tradenames which are being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
at december  significant progress had been made on the development of the ipr d that was acquired from mci  ans  and compuserve 
in general  the company believes that each acquired company s r d efforts are on track with management s plans at the time the transactions occurred 
the company is continuing to invest in the development of the technologies that were under development at the consummation of the transactions 
related to mci  approximately million of the planned total cost to complete of million has been incurred as of december  related to ans and compuserve  the r d projects that were underway at the time of the transaction have been carried out in accordance with company plans 
as such  cost incurred to complete the ans and compuserve projects did not differ materially from the original estimate of million 
through this date  no significant adjustments have been made to the economic assumptions or expectations that underlie the company s acquisition decisions and related purchase accounting 
the preceding paragraphs include statements that constituted forward looking statements  and were not made with a view to public disclosure and were based on a variety of estimates and judgements 
actual results may vary materially due to a number of significant risks  including  without limitation  uncertainties regarding future business  economic  competitive  regulatory and financial market conditions and future business decisions  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the company s control 
no assurance can be given that such projections or other statements will be realized 
the company does not intend to update or supplement these projections or other statements in the future 
interest expense 
interest expense for was million or of revenues  as compared to million or of revenues reported for the increase in interest expense is attributable to higher debt levels as a result of the mci merger  higher capital expenditures and the fixed rate debt financings  offset by lower interest rates as a result of certain tender offers for outstanding debt in the first and fourth quarters of and slightly lower rates in effect on the company s variable rate debt 
interest expense for was favorably impacted as a result of the shl sale proceeds  investment sales proceeds and proceeds from the increase in the company s receivables purchase program being utilized to repay indebtedness under the company s credit facilities and commercial paper program 
for and  weighted average annual interest rates on the company s long term debt were and respectively  while weighted average annual levels of borrowings were billion and billion  respectively 
miscellaneous income and expense 
miscellaneous income for was million or of revenues as compared to million or of revenues reported for miscellaneous income includes investment income  interest income  equity in income and losses of affiliated companies  the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates for transactions denominated in foreign currencies  gains and losses on the sale of assets and other nonoperating items 
miscellaneous income and expense for includes million of gains on securities sold  offset by million of foreign currency translation losses related to the impact of the local currency devaluation in brazil and its effect on embratel s holdings of us dollar and other foreign currency denominated debt 
also included was a million charge related to the redemption of certain outstanding senior notes of the company 
provision for income taxes 
the effective income tax rate for was of income before taxes 
the rate is greater than the expected federal statutory rate of primarily due to the fact that amortization of the goodwill related to the mci merger is not deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the nondeductible amortization of goodwill  the company s effective income tax rate would have been 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
in  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
this accounting standard required all companies to expense  on or before march   all start up costs previously capitalized  and thereafter to expense all costs of start up activities as incurred 
this accounting standard broadly defines start up activities as one time activities related to the opening of a new facility  the introduction of a new product or service  the commencement of business in a new territory  the establishment of business with a new class of customer  the initiation of a new process in an existing facility or the commencement of a new operation 
the company adopted this standard as of january  the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle resulted in a one time  non cash expense of million  net of income tax benefit of million 
this expense represented start up costs incurred primarily in conjunction with the development and construction of skytel s advanced messaging network 
extraordinary items 
in the first quarter of  the company recorded an extraordinary item totaling million  net of income tax benefit of million 
the charge was recorded in connection with the tender offers and certain related refinancings of the company s outstanding debt from the bfp merger 
net income loss applicable to common shareholders 
for  the company reported net income applicable to common shareholders of billion as compared to a net loss of billion reported for diluted income per common share was compared to a loss per share of for the comparable period 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  revenues for increased to billion as compared to billion for the increase in total revenues is attributable to the mci merger  the compuserve merger and the aol transaction as well as internal growth 
results for include mci and embratel operations from september  excluding embratel  the company s revenues increased to billion in actual reported revenues by category and associated revenue increases for the year ended december  and reflect the following changes by category dollars in millions actual actual percent change revenues voice   data   internet  international  communications services   messaging other total revenues before embratel   embratel  n a total reported revenues   the following table provides supplemental pro forma detail for mci worldcom revenues 
since actual results for only reflect days of operations for mci and eleven months of compuserve network services and ans  the pro forma results are more indicative of internal growth for the combined company 
the pro forma revenues  excluding embratel  for the year ended december  and reflect the following changes by category dollars in millions pro pro forma forma percent change revenues voice   data   internet   international  communications services   messaging other   total revenues   pro forma results for the prior periods reflect a classification change for inbound international settlements which are now being treated as an offset to line costs instead of revenues 
previously  both mci and worldcom classified foreign post telephone and telegraph administration settlements on a gross basis with the outbound settlement reflected as line cost expense and the inbound settlement reflected as revenues 
this change better reflects the way in which the business is operated because the company actually settles in cash through a formal net settlement process that is inherent in the operating agreements with foreign carriers 
the following discusses the pro forma revenue increases for the year ended december  as compared to pro forma revenues for the comparable prior year period 
the pro forma revenues assume that the mci merger  compuserve merger and the aol transaction occurred at the beginning of these pro forma revenues do not include embratel or the imci business that was sold 
changes in actual results of operations are shown in the consolidated statements of operations and the foregoing tables and  as noted above  primarily reflect the mci merger  compuserve merger  aol transaction and the internal growth of the company 
pro forma voice revenues for experienced a year over year increase driven by a gain of in traffic 
voice revenues include both long distance and local domestic switched revenues 
strong long distance volume gains in domestic commercial sales channels  combined with an increasing mix of local services  were the primary contributors to this increase 
pro forma local voice revenues grew in versus the same period of the prior year  but remained a relatively small component of total company revenues for pro forma data revenues for increased year over year 
data includes both long distance and local dedicated bandwidth sales 
the revenue growth for data services continues to be driven by significant commercial end user demand for high speed data and by internet related growth on both a local and long haul basis 
this growth was not only being fueled by connectivity demands  but also by applications that have become more strategic  far reaching and complex  additionally  bandwidth consumption drove an acceleration in growth for higher capacity circuits 
rapidly growing demand for higher bandwidth services has contributed to a pro forma year over year local data revenue growth for as of december   the company had approximately million domestic local voice grade equivalents and approximately  buildings in the us  connected over its high capacity circuits 
domestic local route miles of connected fiber exceeded  and domestic long distance route miles exceeded  at december  pro forma internet revenues for increased over the pro forma amount 
growth was driven by both dial up and dedicated connectivity to the internet as more and more business customers migrated their data networks and applications to internet based technologies 
mci s internet revenues have been excluded from the above table  due to the divestiture of the imci business 
pro forma international revenues those revenues originating outside of the united states  excluding embratel for were billion  an increase of as compared with million for the same pro forma period of the prior year 
significant percentage gains in international revenues were achieved in continental europe in response to the company s rapidly expanding networks and sales effort 
in july  the pan european network was commissioned for service and as of december  provided mci worldcom the capability to connect from end to end over  buildings in europe all over its own high capacity circuits 
in europe  the company had over route miles of local fiber and over  long distance route miles at december  the pan european networks and national networks in the uk  france  germany and belgium drove higher growth of enhanced data sales internationally 
the resulting revenue mix shift contributed to improved margins in spite of the competitive pricing environment 
pro forma messaging revenues for were million  up compared with the increase is primarily attributable to the growth in revenues from advanced messaging services 
pro forma other revenues for were billion  down as compared with other revenues  which consists primarily of the operations of shl  include equipment deployment  consulting and systems integration and outsourcing services 
the year over year decline reflects the negative impact of eliminating certain lines of operation and the canadian currency translation effects 
the following discusses the actual results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  line costs 
line costs as a percentage of revenues for were as compared to reported for the same period of the prior year 
overall decreases are attributable to changes in the product mix and synergies and economies of scale resulting from network efficiencies achieved from the assimilation of mci  compuserve network services and ans into the company s operations and were offset in part by universal service fund costs recorded for the year 
additionally  access charge reductions beginning in july reduced total line cost expense by approximately million in while access charge reductions were primarily passed through to the customer  line costs as a percentage of revenues were positively affected by more than half a percentage point for the company anticipates that line costs as a percentage of revenues will continue to decline as a result of further synergies and economies of scale resulting from network efficiencies achieved from the assimilation of the former mci and worldcom networks 
additionally  local revenues have increased rapidly and line costs related to local are primarily fixed in nature leading to lower line costs as a percentage of revenues 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were billion or of revenues as compared to billion or of revenues for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december   which includes mci for days  reflects the company s expanding operations  primarily through the mci merger 
the company s goal is to achieve additional selling  general and administrative synergies in connection with the mci merger through the assimilation of mci into the company s strategy of cost control 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased to billion or of revenues from billion or of revenues for the increase reflects increased amortization associated with the mci merger  compuserve merger and aol transaction and additional depreciation related to capital expenditures 
as a percentage of revenues  these costs decreased due to the higher revenue base 
in process research and development and other charges 
in  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in connection with the bfp merger  the mci merger  and certain asset write downs and loss contingencies 
such charges included million for employee severance  million for bfp direct merger costs  million for conformance of bfp accounting policies  million for exit costs under long term commitments  million for write down of a permanently impaired investment  and million related to certain asset write downs and loss contingencies 
the million related to long term commitments includes million of minimum commitments between and for leased facilities that the company has or will abandon  million related to certain minimum contractual network lease commitments that expire between and  for which the company will receive no future benefit due to the migration of traffic to owned facilities  and million of other commitments 
additionally  the million related to certain asset write downs and loss contingencies includes million for the decommission of certain information systems that have no alternative future use  million for the write down to fair value of certain assets held for sale that were disposed of in and million related to legal costs and other items related to bfp 
in connection with certain business combinations  the company made allocations of the purchase price to acquired ipr d totaling million in the first quarter of related to the compuserve merger and aol transaction and billion in the third quarter of related to the mci merger 
these allocations represent the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted future cash flows related to the incomplete projects 
at the date of the respective business combinations  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the r d in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the respective acquisition dates 
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value was based on the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the respective business enterprises were comprised of various types of assets  each possessing different degrees of investment risk contributing to the company s overall wacc 
intangible assets were assessed higher risk factors due to their lack of liquidity and poor versatility for redeployment elsewhere in the business 
in the mci  compuserve network services and ans analyses the implied wacc was  and respectively  based on the purchase price paid  assumed liabilities  projected cash flows  and each company s asset mix 
returns on monetary and fixed assets were estimated based on then prevailing interest rates 
the process for quantifying intangible asset investment risk involved consideration of the uncertainty associated with realizing discernible cash flows over the life of the asset 
a discount range of to was used for valuing the ipr d 
these discount ranges were higher than the wacc due to the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the purchased ipr d  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and the uncertainty of technological advances that were unknown at that time 
the value of the ipr d projects was adjusted to reflect the relative value and contribution of the acquired r d 
in doing so  consideration was given to the r d s stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed to date  the difficulty of completing the remaining development  costs already incurred and the projected cost to complete the projects 
the company believes that the assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the respective business combination 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from the projected results 
management expects to continue supporting these r d efforts and believes the company has a reasonable chance of successfully completing the r d programs 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the r d projects and the company cannot give any assurance that any will meet with either technological or commercial success 
if none of these r d projects are successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
the failure of any particular individual project in process would not materially impact the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or the attractiveness of the overall investment of mci  compuserve network services or ans 
operating results are subject to uncertain market events and risks which are beyond the company s control  such as trends in technology  government regulations  market size and growth  and product introduction or other actions by competitors 
a description of the acquired in process technology and the estimates made by the company at the time each business combination was completed is set forth below 
mci 
the in process technology acquired in the mci merger consisted of seventy significant r d projects grouped into six categories

as of december   the company recorded the change in value of the note as a reduction of the note payable with the offset through foreign currency translation adjustment in shareholders investment 
as of december   embratel had million of long term debt outstanding  of which approximately million was denominated in us dollars and million denominated in other currencies including the french franc  deutsche mark  japanese yen and brazilian real 
the effective cost to embratel of borrowing in foreign currencies  such as the us dollar  depends principally on the exchange rate between the brazilian real and the currencies in which its borrowings are denominated 
as of december   the brazilian real had devalued over against the us dollar since december  as a result  the company recorded a million foreign currency loss to miscellaneous expense during the year ended december  after the elimination of minority interests  this charge totaled approximately million on a pretax basis 
if this devaluation is sustained  or worsens  embratel would record a similar charge to its future earnings equal to the increase in the us dollar liability resulting from such devaluation 
the net effect to the company s operations would be approximately of such charge after elimination of minority interests 
for the year ended december   the company s cash flow from operations increased billion to billion from the comparable period for the increase in cash flow from operations was primarily attributable to the mci merger  internal growth and synergies and economies of scale resulting from network efficiencies and selling  general and administrative cost savings achieved from the assimilation of recent acquisitions into the company s operations

primary capital expenditures include purchases of switching  transmission  communications and other equipment 
the company anticipates that approximately billion will be spent during for transmission and communications equipment  construction and other capital expenditures without regard to embratel 
acquisitions and related costs includes the costs associated with the mci merger  compuserve merger  aol transaction and smaller acquisitions completed during under the sprint merger agreement  each outstanding share of sprint s fon common stock will be exchanged for of mci worldcom common stock  subject to a collar 
in addition  each share of sprint s pcs common stock will be exchanged for one share of a new mci worldcom pcs tracking stock and shares of mci worldcom common stock 
the terms of the mci worldcom pcs tracking stock will be virtually identical to the terms of sprint s pcs common stock and will be designed to track the performance of the pcs business of the surviving company in the sprint merger 
holders of the shares of the other classes or series of sprint capital stock will receive one share of a class or series of the company s capital stock with virtually identical terms  which will be established in connection with the sprint merger  for each share of sprint capital stock that they own 
sprint will redeem for cash each outstanding share of the sprint first and second series preferred stock before completion of the sprint merger 
the sprint merger  valued at approximately billion  will be accounted for as a purchase and will be tax free to sprint stockholders 
the actual number of shares of mci worldcom common stock to be exchanged for each share of sprint s fon common stock will be determined based on the average trading prices of mci worldcom common stock prior to the closing  but will not be less than shares if mci worldcom s average stock price equals or exceeds or more than shares if mci worldcom s average stock price equals or is less than 
consummation of the sprint merger is subject to various conditions set forth in the sprint merger agreement  including the adoption of the sprint merger agreement by stockholders of sprint  the approval of the sprint merger by shareholders of the mci worldcom  the approval of the issuance of mci worldcom capital stock in the sprint merger by shareholders of mci worldcom  certain us and foreign regulatory approvals and other customary conditions 
special meetings of the shareholders of mci worldcom and sprint have been called for april  to vote on the merger proposals 
it is anticipated that the sprint merger will close in the second half of additionally  if the sprint merger is consummated  the integration and consolidation of sprint will require substantive management and financial resources and involve a number of significant risks  including potential difficulties in assimilating technologies and services of sprint and in achieving anticipated synergies and cost reductions 
increases in interest rates on mci worldcom s variable rate debt would have an adverse effect upon mci worldcom s reported net income and cash flow 
the company believes that it will generate sufficient cash flow to service mci worldcom s debt and capital requirements  however  economic downturns  increased interest rates and other adverse developments  including factors beyond mci worldcom s control  could impair its ability to service its indebtedness 
in addition  the cash flow required to service mci worldcom s debt may reduce its ability to fund internal growth  additional acquisitions and capital improvements 
the development of the businesses of mci worldcom and the installation and expansion of its domestic and international networks will continue to require significant capital expenditures 
failure to have access to sufficient funds for capital expenditures on acceptable terms or the failure to achieve capital expenditure synergies may require mci worldcom to delay or abandon some of its plans  which could have a material adverse effect on the success of mci worldcom 
the company has historically utilized a combination of cash flow from operations and debt to finance capital expenditures and a mixture of cash flow  debt and stock to finance acquisitions 
additionally  the company expects to experience increased capital intensity due to network expansion and merger related expenses as noted above and believes that funding needs in excess of internally generated cash flow and the credit facilities and commercial paper program will be met by accessing the debt markets 
the company believes that  if consummated  the sprint merger will create substantial opportunities for cost savings and operating efficiencies 
these savings are anticipated to result primarily from economies of scale and procurement efficiencies 
there can  however  be no assurance that any specific level of cost savings or other operating efficiencies will be achieved 
additionally  the company expects that  after the proposed sprint merger  the mci worldcom pcs group will continue to build its network and expand its customer base  causing it to continue to incur significant operating losses and to generate significant negative cash flow from operating activities for the next to months  which could adversely affect the results and financial condition of the combined company as a whole 
there can be no assurance that the mci worldcom pcs group will achieve or sustain operating profitability or positive cash flow from operating activities in the future 
absent significant capital requirements for other acquisitions  the company believes that cash flow from operations and available liquidity  including the company s credit facilities and commercial paper program and available cash will be sufficient to meet the company s capital needs for the next twelve months 
however  the company continues to diversify its funding sources and believes that funding needs in excess of internally generated cash flow and availability under the company s credit facilities and commercial paper program could be met by accessing debt markets 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities

year readiness disclosure mci worldcom is pleased to report that the company s network  application systems  and internet services made a successful transition into the year and continue to function normally 
while the initial year rollover period is now over  the company will continue proactive system testing and monitoring procedures 
during the first quarter of  the company has focused on closing down the work teams  storage of data collected over the three year effort and getting back to business as usual 
the year costs incurred by mci and worldcom through december   were approximately million 
this level of expenditures is consistent with the planned expenditures for the related periods 
the company expects to incur approximately million in costs during calendar year to support final completion of its year compliance initiatives 
euro conversion on january   certain member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency euro 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro will be between january  to july  all of the final rules and regulations have not yet been identified by the european commission with regard to the euro 
the company is currently evaluating methods to address the many issues involved with the introduction of the euro  including the conversion of information technology systems  recalculating currency risk  recalibrating derivatives and other financial instruments  strategies concerning continuity of contracts  and impacts on the processes for preparing taxation and accounting records 
at this time  the company has not yet determined the cost related to addressing this issue and there can be no assurance as to the effect of the euro on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in market values of its investments 
the company s policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
currently  the company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk 
the company has minimal cash flow exposure due to general interest rate changes for its fixed rate  long term debt obligations 
the company does not believe a hypothetical adverse rate change in the company s variable rate debt obligations would be material to the company s results of operations 
the tables below provide information about the company s risk exposure associated with changing interest rates on long term debt obligations that impact the fair value of these obligations as of december  and long term debt in millions of dollars as of december  average average foreign average fixed interest variable interest currency interest expected maturity rate rate rate rate denominated rate thereafter  total    fair value  december     long term debt in millions of dollars as of december  average average foreign average fixed interest variable interest currency interest expected maturity rate rate rate rate denominated rate thereafter  total    fair value  december     the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate risk primarily due to embratel s holding of approximately million in us dollar denominated debt  and approximately million of indebtedness indexed in other foreign currencies including french franc  deutsche mark  japanese yen and brazilian real as of december  the potential immediate loss to the company that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates based on this position would be approximately million after elimination of minority interests 
in addition  if such change were to be sustained  the company s cost of financing would increase in proportion to the change 
during january  the brazilian government allowed its currency to trade freely against other currencies resulting in an immediate devaluation of the brazilian real 
as of december   the brazilian real had devalued over against the us dollar since december  as a result  the company recorded a million foreign currency loss to miscellaneous expense during the year ended december  after the elimination of minority interests  this charge totaled approximately million on a pretax basis 
if this devaluation is sustained  or worsens  the net impact to the company s results of operations could be significant 
the company is also subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for its international operations which use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
additionally  the company has designated the note payable in local currency installments  resulting from the embratel investment  as a hedge of its investment in embratel 
as of december   the company recorded the change in value of the note as a reduction to the note payable with the offset through foreign currency translation adjustment in shareholders investment 
the company believes its market risk exposure with regard to its marketable equity securities is limited to changes in quoted market prices for such securities 
based upon the composition of the company s marketable equity securities at december   the company does not believe a hypothetical adverse change in quoted market prices would be material to net income
