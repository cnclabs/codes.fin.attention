revenues from one customer and its manufacturing subcontractor represented  and of the company s net revenues for fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
revenues from another customer and its manufacturing subcontractors represented and of the company s net revenues for fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
in august  hifn completed its acquisition of apptitude  a provider of embedded internet traffic analysis solutions 
the transaction was achieved through a merger of apptitude with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of hifn 
in connection with the acquisition  hifn issued an aggregate  shares of common stock to the shareholders of apptitude 
hifn assumed all outstanding options of apptitude and provided for the issuance of  shares of hifn common stock upon exercise of such options 
hifn further provided for the issuance of  additional hifn shares relating to stock options granted to apptitude employees for retention purposes 
the acquisition resulted in a million write off of in process research and development in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition to the tangible assets and liabilities assumed with the acquisition of apptitude  hifn also acquired the following intangible assets developed and core technology 
developed and core technology was comprised of all technology used in the existing products of apptitude at the time of the acquisition and which had reached technological feasibility 
this includes apptitude s meterflow and meterworks products 
in process research and development 
apptitude was in the process of developing its meterflow asic product and  as this product was not developed at the time of the acquisition  was determined to be in process technology 
workforce 
apptitude s workforce consisted primarily of highly skilled engineers with specialized experience in flow classification and traffic analysis 
this workforce has been valued as an intangible assets of the acquisition as it would be difficult and expensive to recreate 
patents 
as of the acquisition date  apptitude had pending patent applications for its existing products 
value was allocated to such patents as it was determined that the patents were for the developed and core technologies of apptitude for which future revenue streams are expected 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect net sales  gross margins and operating income 
these factors include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of proprietary and second source products sold  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  competitive pricing pressures  the company s ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  cyclical semiconductor industry conditions  the company s access to advanced process technologies and the timing and extent of process development costs 
historically in the semiconductor industry  average selling prices of products have decreased over time 
if the company is unable to introduce new products with higher margins  maintain its product mix between proprietary and second source products  or reduce manufacturing cost to offset decreases in the prices of its existing products  then the company s operating results will be adversely affected 
the company s business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer 
since most of the company s backlog is cancelable without penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand 
customer demand remains highly unpredictable and variances to the forecast can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  because of high fixed costs on the semiconductor industry  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  the company has experienced and may in the future experience material adverse fluctuations in its operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which have in the past and would in the future materially affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
prior to december   hifn was a majority owned subsidiary of stac  inc stac 
on december   stac distributed all of hifn s outstanding shares held by stac to stac stockholders 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated year ended september  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles and goodwill purchased in process research development total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended september   and net revenues 
revenue from sales of semiconductors and licenses of software libraries increased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  revenue increased compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenue in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to increasing sales of hifn s data compression and encryption processors to network equipment manufacturers 
the increase in revenue in fiscal compared to the prior year was due primarily to increased sales of hifn s data compression processors to original equipment manufacturer oem providers of storage devices and manufacturers of networking equipment 
semiconductor sales to quantum  an oem producer of high performance tape storage devices  through its manufacturing subcontractor  comprised  and of revenue in each of fiscal years  and  respectively 
semiconductor sales to lucent  an oem producer of networking equipment  through its manufacturing subcontractors  comprised and of revenue in fiscal years and  respectively 
gross margin 
gross margin was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in gross margin in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a shift in the mix of the company s revenues with a higher percentage of networking products as compared to the prior year coupled with a decrease in product costs in most of the company s product lines 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal from that of fiscal was due primarily to the higher percentage of products that combine compression and encryption 
the combined compression and encryption products tend to command higher gross margins than the products which only offer the compression function 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal  million  or of revenues  in fiscal and million  or of revenues  in fiscal research and development expenses increased in fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal the increase in research and development costs in each successive period was due to increases in labor  benefits  office administration and depreciation costs related to the addition of personnel  including engineers acquired from apptitude in fiscal  and retention of outside contractors used to develop new products which combine data compression and data encryption for the network security markets and to develop additional products for the storage market 
in addition  amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the acquisition of apptitude also contributed to the increase in research and development expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal hifn expects its investments in research and development to increase in coming periods on an absolute basis as it continues to develop products targeted at meeting market needs 
however  there can be no assurance that product development programs invested in by hifn will be successful or timely  or that products resulting from such programs will achieve market acceptance 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal  million  or of revenues  in fiscal and million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to increased costs related to increased headcount  commissions and outside services to support marketing efforts 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal over those of fiscal resulted from the addition of sales and marketing personnel and program costs intended to increase customer awareness of hifn s products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million  or of revenues  in fiscal  million  or of revenues  in fiscal and million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal is mainly due to higher salaries and benefits costs as well as office administration and depreciation costs as a result of increased headcount 
additionally  increased legal and accounting costs and amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the apptitude acquisition contributed to the increase 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal over those of fiscal primarily as a result of the addition of executive management personnel and increased legal and accounting costs 
legal and accounting costs for the fiscal years ended  and were   and  respectively 
amortization of intangibles and goodwill 
amortization of intangibles and goodwill in fiscal of million  or of revenues  was a result of the acquisition of apptitude and other intellectual property 
amortization of intangibles of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  related to the acquired technology from cylan 
purchased in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development ipr d related to the acquisition of apptitude was million or of revenues 
purchased ipr d relates to the value assigned to apptitude s meterflow asic product which had not reached technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net for fiscal were million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase was primarily a result of interest income earned on the net proceeds of million raised in an equity offering of  shares of common stock in march and april income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax provision of million in fiscal at an effective rate of 
in fiscal  the company recorded an income tax provision of million at an effective rate of compared to million in fiscal at an effective rate of 
the increase in the effective rate for fiscal was due to the non deductibility of certain acquisition related costs incurred during fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the non deductibility of certain spin off related costs incurred during fiscal for the period up to december  and for fiscal  deferred income taxes and related tax expense have been allocated to hifn by applying the asset and liability approach as if hifn were a separate taxpayer 
under this approach  a deferred income tax liability or asset  net of valuation allowance  is established for the expected future consequences resulting from the differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and from net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax expense or benefit represents the net change during the year in the deferred income tax liability or asset 
income taxes currently payable are deemed to have been remitted by stac on behalf of hifn in the period that the liability arose 
income taxes currently receivable are deemed to have been received by stac in the period that a refund could have been recognized by hifn  had hifn been a separate taxpayer 
amounts due to or from hifn and stac for income tax payments and refunds are included in the related party receivable and payable components of the balance sheet 
liquidity and capital resources from inception until the spin off from stac in december  hifn depended upon stac for financing its operations and capital requirements 
in november  hifn and stac entered into an assignment  assumption and license agreement the assignment agreement which provided for the transfer of stac s semiconductor business to hifn in exchange for  shares of series a preferred stock and shares of common stock of hifn 
concurrent with the transfer of the semiconductor business  hifn and stac also entered into a cross license agreement under which hifn granted stac a limited  worldwide  perpetual  non exclusive  non transferable  royalty free license to the patents transferred by stac to hifn under the assignment agreement 
operating activities 
in fiscal  the company generated cash from operating activities of approximately million comprised of net income as adjusted for non cash items including purchased in process research and development of million  amortization of intangibles and deferred stock compensation of million  deferred income taxes of million  depreciation and amortization costs of million and tax benefit from employee stock plans of million as well as a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
these adjustments were offset mainly by decreases in income taxes payable of million and in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million 
in fiscal  the company generated cash from operating activities of approximately million  principally attributable to net income from operations  increases in taxes payable of million and accrued and other liabilities of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million 
financing activities 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million  primarily for the acquisition of apptitude and the purchase of intellectual property aggregating million  the purchase of short term investments of million and the acquisition of million in property and equipment 
during fiscal  the company generated million from the sale of marketable securities and invested million in the acquisition of property and equipment 
hifn expects capital expenditures in the foreseeable future to remain at approximately the same levels 
investing activities 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million reflects proceeds from the issuance of common stock for stock option exercises and stock purchase plan of million slightly offset by payments on debt obligations 
on september   stac paid million to hifn  representing payment in full for all amounts due to hifn from stac as of september  stac also loaned million to hifn under a short term loan that became due and payable on september   but which could be prepaid in whole or part without penalty 
the loan accrued interest at the prime rate set by silicon valley bank plus per annum  payable quarterly  and was secured by a first priority security interest in all of hifn s assets  including hifn s intellectual property 
in march  the entire million loan was repaid 
also in march  the company issued million shares of common stock at a price of per share in an equity offering  which raised approximately million  net of offering expenses 
in april  the company s underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional  shares of the company s common stock  which yielded an additional million in proceeds to the company 
in fiscal  the company received million in proceeds from the repayment of a loan to a related party and paid a total of million in transfers to the company s former parent  stac 
hifn uses a number of independent suppliers to manufacture substantially all of its products 
as a result  hifn relies on these suppliers to allocate to hifn a sufficient portion of foundry capacity to meet hifn s needs and deliver sufficient quantities of hifn s products on a timely basis 
these arrangements allow hifn to avoid utilizing its capital resources for manufacturing facilities and work in process inventory and to focus substantially all of its resources on the design  development and marketing of its products 
hifn requires substantial working capital to fund its business  particularly to finance accounts receivable and inventory  and for investments in property and equipment 
hifn s need to raise capital in the future will depend on many factors including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of hifn s existing and new products  the amount and timing of research and development expenditures  the timing and size of acquisitions of businesses or technologies  the timing of the introduction of new products and the expansion of sales and marketing efforts 
in august  hifn completed its acquisition of apptitude 
the purchase price of the acquisition of million  which included  in estimated acquisition related costs  was used to acquire the net assets of apptitude 
the allocation of the purchase price was as follows property and equipment current and other assets  deferred tax asset  liabilities assumed  goodwill  purchased in process research and development  acquired developed and core technology  workforce and patents  the goodwill  acquired developed and core technology  workforce and patents are recorded on the balance sheet as intangibles and other assets and will be amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from two to five years 
the purchased in process research and development was expensed at the time of the acquisition as a one time charge 
trends and uncertainties in future periods  hifn s business  financial condition and results of operations may be affected by many factors  including but not limited to the following we have a limited operating history as an independent company 
on august   we were incorporated by stac  inc stac which transferred its semiconductor business to us in exchange for shares of our preferred stock and common stock 
because we are a relatively new company with a limited operating history  we may experience financial and other difficulties as we attempt to grow our business 
for example  to expand our business we are increasing our research and development and other operating expenses 
this increase in expenses will negatively affect our financial performance unless we are able to sustain and grow revenues 
if we are not able to evolve and expand our business  we may not remain profitable and therefore may not be able to sustain a viable business 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
this fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors including the following general business conditions in our markets as well as global economic uncertainty  increases or reductions in demand for our customers products  the timing and volume of orders we receive from our customers  cancellations or delays of customer product orders  any new product introductions by us or our competitors  our suppliers increasing costs or changing the delivery of products to us  increased competition or reductions in the prices that we are able to charge  the variety of the products that we sell as well as seasonal demand for our products  and the availability of manufacturing capacity necessary to make our products 
we depend upon a small number of customers 
quantum corporation quantum  through its manufacturing subcontractor  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues in fiscal  and lucent  through its manufacturing subcontractors  accounted for approximately and of our revenues during fiscal and  respectively 
neither quantum nor lucent are under any binding obligation to order from us 
if our sales to quantum or lucent decline  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
we expect that our most significant customers in the future could be different from our largest customers today for a number of reasons  including customers deployment schedules and budget considerations 
as a result  we believe we may experience significant fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and an annual basis 
limited numbers of network and storage equipment vendors account for a majority of packet processor purchases in their respective markets 
in particular  the market for network equipment that would include packet processors  such as routers  remote access concentrators and firewalls  is dominated by a few large vendors  including cisco systems  inc  lucent technologies inc  nortel networks  inc 
and com corporation 
as a result  our future success will depend upon our ability to establish and maintain relationships with these companies 
if these network equipment vendors do not incorporate our packet processors into their products  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our business depends upon the development of the packet processor market 
our prospects are dependent upon the acceptance of packet processors as an alternative to other technology traditionally utilized by network and storage equipment vendors 
many of our current and potential customers have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources and currently develop internally the application specific integrated circuit components and program the general purpose microprocessors utilized in their products as an alternative to our packet processors 
these customers may in the future continue to rely on these solutions or may determine to develop or acquire components  technologies or packet processors that are similar to  or that may be substituted for  our products 
in order to be successful  we must anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of such network and storage equipment vendors and must successfully develop and manufacture products that meet their requirements 
in addition  we must make products available to these large customers on a timely basis and at competitive prices 
if orders from customers are cancelled  decreased or delayed  or if we fail to obtain significant orders from new customers  or any significant customer delays or fails to pay  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our business depends upon the continued growth and our penetration of the virtual private network market 
we want to be a leading supplier of packet processors that implement the network security protocols necessary to support the deployment of virtual private networks 
this market  which is still emerging  may not grow and if it does continue to grow  our products may not successfully serve this market 
our ability to generate significant revenue in the virtual private network market will depend upon  among other things  the following our ability to demonstrate the benefits of our technology to distributors  original equipment manufacturers and end users  and the increased use of the internet by businesses as replacements for  or enhancements to  their private networks 
if we are unable to penetrate the virtual private network market  or if that market fails to develop  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
we face risks associated with evolving industry standards and rapid technological change 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards 
our performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to do the following properly identify emerging target markets and related technological trends  develop and maintain competitive products  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of competitors  bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices  and respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
our past success has been dependent in part upon our ability to develop products that have been selected for design into new products of leading equipment manufacturers 
however  the development of our packet processors is complex and  from time to time  we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
we may not be able to adhere to our new product design and introduction schedules and our products may not be accepted in the market at favorable prices  if at all 
in evaluating new product decisions  we must anticipate future demand for product features and performance characteristics  as well as available supporting technologies  manufacturing capacity  competitive product offerings and industry standards 
we must also continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to enhance the performance and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and customer demands for improved performance  features and functionality 
the technical innovations required for the company to remain competitive are complicated and require a significant amount of time and money 
we may experience substantial difficulty in introducing new products and we may be unable to offer enhancements to existing products on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all 
for instance  the performance of our encryption compression and public key processors depends upon the integrity of our security technology 
if any significant advances in overcoming cryptographic systems are made  then the security of our encryption compression and public key processors will be reduced or eliminated unless we are able to develop further technical innovations that adequately enhance the security of these products 
our inability to develop and introduce new products or enhancements directed at new industry standards could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our markets are highly competitive 
we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and are expected to become more competitive as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter the market 
the markets that we compete in are subject to frequent product introductions with improved price performance characteristics  rapid technological change  and the continued emergence of new industry standards 
our products compete with offerings from companies such as analog devices  inc  safenet  inc  international business machines corporation ibm  broadcom corporation  motorola  inc and philips corporation 
in  stac entered into two license agreements with ibm in which stac granted ibm the right to use  but not sublicense  our patented compression technology in ibm hardware and software products 
stac also entered into a license agreement with microsoft corporation microsoft in whereby stac granted microsoft the right to use  but not sublicense  our compression technology in their software products 
we expect significant future competition from major domestic and international semiconductor suppliers 
several established electronics and semiconductor suppliers have recently entered  or expressed an interest to enter  the network equipment market 
we also may face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
furthermore  many of our existing and potential customers internally develop solutions which attempt to perform all or a portion of the functions performed by our products 
a key element of our packet processor architecture is our encryption technology 
until recently  in order to export our encryption related products  the us department of commerce required us to obtain a license 
foreign competitors that were not subject to similar requirements have an advantage over us in their ability to establish existing markets for their products and rapidly respond to the requests of customers in the global market 
although the export restriction has been liberalized  the company may not be successful in entering or competing the foreign encryption markets 
see our products are subject to export restrictions 
many of our current and prospective competitors offer broader product lines and have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than us 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to promote the sale of their products 
in particular  companies such as intel corporation  lucent technologies inc  motorola  inc  national semiconductor corporation  and texas instruments incorporated have a significant advantage over us given their relationships with many of our customers  their extensive marketing power and name recognition and their much greater financial resources 
in addition  current and potential competitors may decide to consolidate  lower the prices of their products or to bundle their products with other products 
any of the above would significantly and negatively impact our ability to compete and obtain or maintain market share 
if we are unable to successfully compete against our competitors  our business  results of operations and financial condition will suffer 
we believe that the important competitive factors in our markets are the following performance  price  the time that is required to develop a new product or enhancements to existing products  the ability to achieve product acceptance with major network and storage equipment vendors  the support that exists for new network and storage standards  features and functionality  adaptability of products to specific applications  reliability  and technical service and support as well as effective intellectual property protection 
if we are unable to successfully develop and market products that compete with those of other suppliers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  we must compete for the services of qualified distributors and sales representatives 
to the extent that our competitors offer distributors or sales representatives more favorable terms  these distributors and sales representatives may decline to carry  or discontinue carrying  our products 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any failure to maintain and expand our distribution network 
our business depends upon the growth of the network equipment and storage equipment markets 
our success is largely dependent upon continued growth in the market for network security equipment  such as routers  remote access concentrators  switches  broadband access equipment  security gateways  firewalls and network interface cards 
in addition  our success depends upon storage equipment vendors incorporating our packet processors into their systems 
the network security equipment market has in the past and may in the future fluctuate significantly based upon numerous factors  including the lack of industry standards  adoption of alternative technologies  capital spending levels and general economic conditions 
we are unable to determine the rate or extent to which these markets will grow  if at all 
any decrease in the growth of the network or storage equipment market or a decline in demand for our products could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends upon protecting our intellectual property 
our proprietary technology is critical to our future success 
we rely in part on patent  trade  trademark  maskwork and copyright law to protect our intellectual property 
we own united states patents and four foreign patents 
we also have pending patent applications in japan 
our issued patents and patent applications primarily cover various aspects of our compression technology and have expiration dates ranging from to in addition to compression  we have six pending patent applications in the united states  four in europe and asia japan covering our flow classification technology 
there are pending patent applications in the united states covering our bandwidth management and rate shaping technology 
patents may not be issued under our current or future patent applications  and the patents issued under such patent applications could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  third parties could make infringement claims against us in the future 
such infringement claims could result in costly litigation 
we may not prevail in any such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
regardless of the outcome  an infringement claim would likely result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources 
any infringement claim or other litigation against us or by us could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the patents issued to us may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights  to deter misappropriation or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying our technology  designing around the patents we own or otherwise obtaining and using our products  designs or other information 
in addition  others could develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
we also claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers  employees and consultants  and through other security measures 
however  our efforts may not be successful 
furthermore  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property 
the length of time it takes to develop our products and make a sale to our customers may impair our operating results 
our customers typically take a long time to evaluate our products 
in fact  it usually takes our customers to months or more to test our products with an additional to months or more before they commence significant production of equipment incorporating our products 
as a result of this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience a delay between increasing expenses for research and development and sales and marketing efforts on the one hand  and the generation of higher revenues  if any  on the other hand 
in addition  the delays inherent in such a lengthy sales cycle raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product plans  which could result in the loss of anticipated sales 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer if customers reduce or delay orders or choose not to release products using our technology 
we depend upon independent manufacturers and limited sources of supply 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture  assemble and test our packet processors 
we currently subcontract our semiconductor manufacturing to atmel corporation  toshiba corporation and motorola  inc since we depend upon independent manufacturers  we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality 
none of our products are manufactured by more than one supplier 
since the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  foundry capacity has been very limited at times in the past and may become limited in the future 
we depend on our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of finished product to us in a timely manner 
since we place orders on a purchase order basis and do not have long term volume purchase agreements with any of our suppliers  our suppliers may allocate production capacity to other products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice 
for example  in june  one of our suppliers delayed the delivery of one of our products 
as a result  we switched production of the product to a new manufacturer 
this caused a month delay in shipments to customers 
we also experienced yield and test anomalies on a different product manufactured by another subcontractor that could have interrupted our customer shipments 
in this case  the manufacturer was able to correct the problem in a timely manner and customer shipments were not affected 
the delay and expense associated with qualifying a new supplier or foundry and commencing volume production can result in lost revenue  reduced operating margins and possible harm to customer relationships 
the steps required for a new manufacturer to begin production of a semiconductor product include adapting our product design  if necessary  to the new manufacturer s process  creating a new mask set to manufacture the product  having the new manufacturer prepare sample products so we can verify the product specification  and providing sample products to customers for qualification 
in general  it takes from to months for a new manufacturer to begin full scale production of one of our products 
we could have similar or more protracted problems in the future with existing or new suppliers 
both toshiba corporation and motorola  inc manufacture products for us in plants located in asia 
to date  the financial and stock market dislocations that have occurred in the asian financial markets have not harmed our business 
however  present or future dislocations or other international business risks  such as currency exchange fluctuations or recessions  could force us to seek new suppliers 
we must place orders approximately to weeks in advance of expected delivery 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products  and could cause us to have an excess or a shortage of inventory of a particular product 
in addition  if global semiconductor manufacturing capacity fails to increase in line with demand  foundries could allocate available capacity to larger customers or customers with long term supply contracts 
if we cannot obtain adequate foundry capacity at acceptable prices  or our supply is interrupted or delayed  our product revenues could decrease or our cost of revenues could increase 
this could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we regularly consider using smaller semiconductor dimensions for each of our products in order to reduce costs 
we have begun to decrease the dimensions in our new product designs  and believe that we must do so to remain competitive 
we may have difficulty decreasing the dimensions of our products 
in the future  we may change our supply arrangements to assume more product manufacturing responsibilities 
we may subcontract for wafer manufacturing  assembly and test rather than purchase finished products 
however  there are additional risks associated with manufacturing  including variances in production yields  the ability to obtain adequate test and assembly capacity at reasonable cost and other general risks associated with the manufacture of semiconductors 
we may also enter into volume purchase agreements that would require us to commit to minimum levels of purchases and which may require up front investments 
if we fail to effectively assume greater manufacturing responsibilities or manage volume purchase arrangements  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
network and storage equipment prices typically decrease 
average selling prices in the networking  storage and semiconductor industries have rapidly declined due to many factors  including rapidly changing technologies  price performance enhancements  and product obsolescence 
the decline in the average selling prices of our products may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future due to product introductions by our competitors  price pressures from significant customers and other factors 
therefore  we must continue to develop and introduce new products that incorporate features which we can sell at higher prices 
if we fail to do so  our revenues and gross margins could decline  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face product return  product liability and product defect risks 
complex products such as ours frequently contain errors  defects and bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have discovered such errors  defects and bugs in the past 
delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could hinder market acceptance of our products 
this could damage our reputation and harm our ability to attract and retain customers 
errors  defects or bugs could also cause interruptions  delays or a cessation of sales to our customers 
we would have to expend significant capital and resources to remedy these problems 
errors  defects or bugs could be discovered in our new products after we begin commercial production of them  despite testing by us and our suppliers and customers 
this could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  claims by our customers or others against us or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
any such event would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face order and shipment uncertainties 
we generally make our sales under individual purchase orders that may be canceled or deferred by customers on short notice without significant penalty  if any 
cancellation or deferral of product orders could cause us to hold excess inventory  which could harm our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to our customers  net of an allowance for estimated returns 
an unanticipated level of returns could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon key personnel 
our success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our key management and other personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with any of our key personnel  nor do we maintain any key man life insurance on any of our personnel 
several members of our management team have joined us in the last months 
it may be difficult for us to integrate new members of our management team 
we must also attract and retain experienced and highly skilled engineering  sales and marketing and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense in the geographic areas and market segments in which we compete  and we may not be successful in hiring and retaining such people 
if we lose the services of any key personnel  or cannot attract or retain qualified personnel  particularly engineers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
in addition  companies in technology industries whose employees accept positions with competitors have in the past claimed that their competitors have engaged in unfair competition or hiring practices 
we could receive such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel 
these claims could result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending against any such claims  regardless of their merits 
our rapid growth may strain our operations 
we have experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion which has placed  and continues to place  a significant strain on our resources 
to accommodate this growth  in fiscal  we implemented a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  including the improvement of the retained accounting and other internal management systems which were provided by stac 
this required and may continue to require substantial management effort  and our efforts to do so may not continue to be successful 
in addition  we have had to hire additional employees to accommodate this growth and our product development activities 
this has resulted in increased responsibilities for our management 
our systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our operations 
if we fail to improve our operational  financial and management information systems  or to hire  train  motivate or manage our employees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our products are subject to export restrictions 
the encryption algorithms embedded in our products are a key element of our packet processor architecture 
these products are subject to us department of commerce export control restrictions 
our network equipment customers may only export products incorporating encryption technology if they obtain a one time technical review 
these us export laws also prohibit the export of encryption products to a number of countries deemed by the us to be hostile 
many foreign countries also restrict exports to many of these countries deemed to be terrorist supporting states by the us government 
because the restrictions on exports of encryption products have been liberalized  hifn and its network equipment customers have an opportunity to effectively compete with its foreign competitors 
the existence of these restrictions until recently may have enabled foreign competitors facing less stringent controls on their products to become more established and  therefore  more competitive in the global market than our network equipment customers 
in addition  the list of products and countries for which export approval is required  and the regulatory policies with respect thereto  could be revised  and laws limiting the domestic use of encryption could be enacted 
while the us government now allows us companies to assume that exports to non government end users will be approved within days of official registration with the department of commerce  the sale of our packet processors could be harmed by the failure of our network equipment customers to obtain the required approvals or by the costs of compliance 
we face risks associated with our international business activities 
we sell most of our products to customers in the united states 
if our international sales increase  particularly in light of decreased export restrictions  we may encounter risks inherent in international operations 
all of our international sales to date are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  if the value of the us dollar increases relative to foreign currencies  our products could become less competitive in international markets 
we also obtain some of our manufacturing  assembly and test services from suppliers located outside the united states 
international business activities could be limited or disrupted by any of the following the imposition of governmental controls  export license technical review requirements  restrictions on the export of technology  currency exchange fluctuations  political instability  financial and stock market dislocations  trade restrictions  and changes in tariffs 
demand for our products also could be harmed by seasonality of international sales and economic conditions in our primary overseas markets 
these international factors could harm future sales of our products to international customers and our business  financial condition and results of operations in general 
we face risks associated with acquisitions 
we continually evaluate strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies that would complement our product offerings or enhance our market coverage or technological capabilities 
while we are not currently negotiating any acquisitions  we may make additional acquisitions in the future 
future acquisitions could be effected without stockholder approval  and could cause us to dilute shareholder equity  incur debt and contingent liabilities and amortize acquisition expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could harm our operating results and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  technologies and products  in particular  if we fail to successfully integrate the acquisition of apptitude  the anticipated benefits of this transaction will not occur  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  and loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
we may not be able to successfully integrate businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we acquire 
if we fail to do so  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
in addition  if we are a party to a transaction or series of transactions that result in or more of our outstanding stock being transferred to one or more persons  the irs may claim that our spin off from stac was a taxable event to stac and its stockholders 
under the tax allocation and indemnity agreement that we entered into with stac  we may be obligated to pay the taxes of stac if we caused the spin off to be a taxable event 
our cash flows  business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer if we became liable for any such tax liability 
see we face certain risks as a result of our spin off from stac 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry may harm our business 
the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
the industry has also experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions 
this has caused significant variances in product demand  production capacity and rapid erosion of average selling prices 
industry wide fluctuations in the future could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face certain risks as a result of our spin off from stac 
on december   stac received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs stating  among other things  that the distribution of our common stock held by stac on december  to stac stockholders would not result in recognition of taxable income or gain to stac or its stockholders under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended code except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares 
a tax ruling  while generally binding upon the irs  is subject to certain factual representations and assumptions 
if the factual representations and assumptions made by stac were incorrect in a material respect  the rights of taxpayers to rely on a tax ruling or stac s ability to rely on the tax opinion would be jeopardized 
if the distribution were not to constitute a tax free spin off  then stac would be treated as recognizing a taxable gain equal to the difference between i the fair market value of our common stock that was distributed to stac stockholders on december  and ii stac s adjusted basis of such common stock 
in addition  under the consolidated tax return rules of the code  each member of stac s consolidated group including hifn would be severally liable for such tax liability 
furthermore  in connection with the spin off we entered into a tax allocation and indemnity agreement with stac whereby each of us agreed that if either party took actions after the spin off that caused section e of the code to apply to hifn s common stock  then whichever party first caused section e of the code to apply to hifn s common stock would be obligated to bear all taxes of stac resulting from such action 
under recently enacted section e of the code  if the spin off was considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions a plan in which  after the spin off  a or greater interest in hifn or stac were acquired by one or more persons  the irs would claim that the spin off was taxable at the corporate level 
although neither we nor stac believes the spin off is part of a plan to effect a change in ownership of either hifn or stac  the irs has issued no guidance on the definition of a plan and for the first two years following the spin off  any cumulative change of ownership within the two year period will be rebuttably presumed to be the result of a plan 
our cash flows  business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer if we became liable for any such tax liability 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of technology related companies including networking  storage and semiconductor companies have been especially volatile 
such fluctuations can result from quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of new products by us or our competitors  the gain or loss of significant customers  changes in analysts estimates  short selling of our common stock  and events affecting other companies that investors deem to be comparable to us 
we are currently engaged in several securities class action lawsuits 
in october and november  six purported class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against the company and certain of its officers and directors 
these complaints were consolidated into in re hi fn sec 
litig  no 
si 
the consolidated complaint was filed on behalf of a class of purchasers of the company s stock during the period july  through october  the class period 
the complaint seeks unspecified money damages and allege that the company and certain of its officers and directors violated federal securities laws in connection with various public statements made by the company and certain of its officers and directors during the class period 
in august  the court dismissed the complaint as to all defendants  other than raymond j 
farnham and the company 
mr 
farnham and the company answered the complaint in september discovery has commenced 
no trial date has been scheduled 
the company believes that the allegations contained in the complaint are without merit and intends to defend the action vigorously 
due to the nature of the allegations  management cannot estimate the possible loss  if any  or range of loss that may ultimately be incurred in connection with the allegations 
however  based on the facts currently known  management does not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio is generally comprised of commercial paper and municipal bonds 
the company places investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of the company s investment portfolio  the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio 
a move in interest rates as of september  would have an immaterial effect on the company s pre tax earnings and the carrying value of its investments over the next fiscal year 
foreign currency exchange rate risk all of the company s sales  cost of manufacturing and marketing are transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  the company s results of operations are not subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
gains and losses from such fluctuations have not been incurred by the company to date
