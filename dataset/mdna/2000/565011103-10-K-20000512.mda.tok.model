our technology initiatives will continue to focus on the changing needs of clients and evolving market dynamics in order to meet this demand 
during fiscal and the first half of fiscal  we experienced operational difficulties caused by  among other factors  problems with direct sales force execution  new and stronger competitive forces and other external factors 
our poor financial performance in fiscal led to our decision to restructure our business 
by the end of fiscal  we completed our operational turnaround  including the hiring of a new executive management team  delivery of enhanced supply chain and ebusiness solutions and an improved market image  which we believe has positioned us well for the future 
although we reported a loss for fiscal  in the third and fourth quarter of the year we generated sequential quarterly license fee revenue growth through operational improvements  including improvements in sales force execution 
results of operations revenues our revenues consist of software license fees  consulting revenues and solution support revenues 
software license revenues are recognized upon execution of a software license agreement  provided that the software product has been shipped  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the license fees are fixed and determinable  collection is considered probable and no significant production  modification or customization of the software is required  in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  for fiscal periods subsequent to december  fees are allocated to the various elements of software license agreements based on our historical fair value experience 
consulting revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
solution support revenues are recognized ratably over the support period defined in the software license agreement 
for the fiscal year ended february   software license revenues were recognized upon the execution of a software license agreement and shipment of the software provided that the license fee was fixed  collection was considered probable and no significant vendor obligations remained outstanding  in accordance with the aicpa s sop  software revenue recognition

our license fees consist primarily of software license revenues from direct sales 
we also earn license fees through indirect channels  primarily through complementary software vendors  consulting firms  distributors and systems integrators 
license fees decreased for the year ended february  compared to the year ended february  primarily because we fielded a smaller direct sales organization during fiscal which resulted in a decrease in the number of licenses sold to customers and a decrease in the average deal size in the first half of fiscal when compared to fiscal license fees decreased for the year ended february  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to sales execution issues and other external factors described below 
our direct sales force execution suffered from delays in new sales employees becoming productive  the major sales territory re alignment that resulted from the rapid sales force expansion and changing to a vertical market organization of the sales force  and certain difficulties involving the integration of the products and operations of promira software  inc promira and tyecin systems  inc tyecin 
see factors that may affect future results 
external factors compounded our sales execution problems and affected our ability to generate license fee revenues  including new and stronger competitive forces  issues impacting clients and prospects such as the year problem and concerns with global economic conditions 
these factors lengthened or deferred sales cycles as clients diverted budgets and other resources to accommodate testing and preparation for the year problem and postponed licensing decisions 
in addition  our operating results during fiscal raised concerns with clients and prospects about our financial viability  which tended to lengthen sales cycles 
we believe that these concerns adversely affected our ability to generate license fee revenues 
although there has been variation in license fees as a percentage of total revenues over the past several quarters  we anticipate that license fees are likely to represent approximately of total revenues for fiscal see forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results 
consulting  solution support and other services 
consulting  solution support and other services services revenues decreased for the year ended february  compared to the year ended february  primarily due to a decrease in implementation services provided  resulting from a lower number of software licenses closed during the year 
services revenue increased for the year ended february  compared to the prior year primarily due to the continuation of customer implementations from license revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal  in addition to an increase in the number of clients being actively supported under solution support agreements 
solution support revenues increased following the increase in the number of clients that have licensed our software products and entered into annual solution support contracts 
solution support revenues tend to track software license fee transactions in prior periods 
in the past three fiscal years  approximately of customers with solution support contracts have renewed these contracts 
operating expenses general 
in the second half of fiscal  we executed company wide restructuring activities that included overall cost containment initiatives as we pursued our business strategies of returning to profitability  expanding product innovation to enable companies to take advantage of e commerce and include interface and integration technology and expanding our indirect distribution channels through alliances with complementary software vendors and consulting and implementation organizations 
due to our cost containment actions  such as headcount and occupancy reductions  total operating expenses decreased for the fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal years ended february  and february the following table sets forth operating expenses for the three fiscal years ended february  and february  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal year ended february or operating expenses change change cost of license fees    percentage of total revenues cost of consulting  solution support and other services    percentage of total revenues sales and marketing    percentage of total revenues product development    percentage of total revenues general and administrative    percentage of total revenues restructuring costs   percentage of total revenues n m acquisition related expenses  percentage of total revenues n m n m purchased research and development  percentage of total revenues n m n m total operating expenses    percentage of total revenues cost of license fees

cost of consulting  solution support and other services consist primarily of personnel costs 
cost of consulting  solution support and other services decreased for the fiscal year ending february   compared to the fiscal year ending february  primarily due to the reduction of expenses in connection with the company wide restructuring activities  which included reducing headcount  in the second half of fiscal cost of services increased for the fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended february  primarily due to hiring additional consultants during the first part of fiscal and increasing product support and training personnel in both domestic and foreign locations 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  commissions  promotional events and advertising 
sales and marketing expenses decreased for the fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal years ending february  and primarily due to the reduction of sales and marketing headcount implemented under the company wide restructuring activities during the second half of fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased for the fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended february  primarily because we added new personnel in both our domestic and foreign locations throughout the first half of fiscal in fiscal  we also incurred promotional costs to establish new offices and enhance our presence in foreign locations 
product development 
we record product development costs net of capitalized software development costs for products that have reached technological feasibility in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

software development costs are amortized at the greater of the amount computed using either a the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product  commencing with the date the product is first available for general release or b the ratio that current gross revenues bears to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel  infrastructure expenses and the fees and expenses associated with legal  accounting and other functions 
general and administrative expenses decreased for the fiscal year ended february  compared to the fiscal years ended february  and  primarily due to the reduction of headcount implemented under our restructuring plan during the second half of fiscal and increased controls on discretionary spending 
acquisition related expenses 
we acquired tyecin in june we accounted for the acquisition as a pooling of interests and recorded a non recurring charge during the second quarter of fiscal of approximately million for certain expenses related to this transaction  including  among other items  accounting  legal and severance expenses 
restructuring costs 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we announced and implemented a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and returning us to profitability 
the restructuring plan was necessitated due to our poor financial performance throughout fiscal  which resulted from various factors including but not limited to poor sales execution  new and stronger competitive factors  lengthening of sales cycles and prospects concerns about the year and global economic conditions 
we reorganized to focus on our core business of providing supply chain solutions to companies with dynamic supply chains  specifically those in the customer driven industries 
we also planned on expanding product innovation to support transforming the supply chain to an e chain and include interface and integration technologies in addition to expanding our distribution channels 
as a result of the restructuring  we recorded charges of  and million in the third and fourth quarters  respectively  in fiscal the components of the charge included in thousands severance and related benefits  lease obligations and terminations  write down of property  equipment and leasehold improvements  write down capitalized software development costs  write down goodwill  other total restructuring charge  due to the redirection of the core business strategy  we eliminated positions  across all divisions  primarily located throughout our us operations of which were terminated prior to year end 
we have paid approximately million and million in severance related costs for the years ending february  and february   respectively  with the remaining to be paid out during fiscal the provision for lease obligations and terminations related primarily to future lease commitments on office facilities that were closed as part of the restructuring 
the charge represented future lease obligations  net of projected sublease income  on such leases past the dates the offices were closed by us 
at the time of the restructuring  some of these subleases were in negotiation but had not been finalized and therefore the charge included management s estimates of the likely outcome of these negotiations 
sublessors were located during fiscal for many of the locations and the original estimates were adjusted  as necessary 
cash payments on the leases and lease terminations will occur over the remaining lease terms  the majority of which expire prior to the million write down of operating assets and million write down of capitalized software development costs relates to a charge to reduce the carrying amount of certain equipment  furniture and fixtures  leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs to their estimated net realizable value  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of 
we also recorded a charge of million to write down goodwill  which was deemed to have a carrying value in excess of the estimated net realizable value 
the net realizable value of these assets was determined based on management estimates  which considered such factors as the nature and age of the assets to be disposed of  the timing of the write down and the method and potential costs of the disposal 
such estimates will be monitored each quarter and adjusted if necessary 
the following table depicts the restructuring activity through february  in thousands fy balance utilization of accrual balance initial february  adjustment february  charge activity to charge cash non cash severance costs      lease obligation costs       impairment of long lived assets     other total        during the year ended february   we reduced our previously recorded restructuring charge by approximately million 
these adjustments related primarily to the sub lease of property that management had believed  at the time of the restructuring  would not be sublet  which were offset by increases in the accrual for severance costs due to the finalization of several executive employee terminations previously identified by management 
purchased research and development 
in february  we acquired all the outstanding shares of promira in exchange for approximately million of consideration composed of cash  shares of manugistics  inc common stock and options to purchase shares of manugistics common stock 
this acquisition was consistent with our strategy of rapidly expanding into new markets 
promira competed in industries and market segments that we had targeted for entry and it had developed complementary product capabilities 
we intended this acquisition to accelerate our delivery of a solution in these new industries and market segments 
the technology acquired in the promira acquisition consisted of existing and in process technologies 
these projects were intended to address specific supply chain planning needs of certain industry and market segments  ie  high tech  industrial and discrete manufacturers 
we utilized an independent appraiser of recognized standing to value the assets of promira  identify the existing technology and the in process research and development r d  and allocate the purchase price among the assets 
the in process r d had not reached technological feasibility  had no future alternative use and successful development of the projects was uncertain 
we accounted for the acquisition as a purchase and  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  charged the value of acquired in process r d of million to expense in the fiscal quarter and year ended february  promira s existing technology was a commercially viable product offering that assists users in developing optimized manufacturing and supply chain plans and enables rapid  intelligent responses to changes in demand  supply  product design or other business objectives 
during the first three quarters of fiscal  this product generated total revenues consistent with management s expectations 
the in process technology consisted of two projects 
the first project consisted of three releases planned for commercial availability in fiscal and fiscal these releases represented major r d efforts  including a general re architecture of the offering to enable integration to the manugistics solution architecture  incorporation of a new architecture to enable robust simultaneous constraint of materials and capacity  a port to the unix platform  incorporation of four digit import  display and export functionality to achieve year compliance and a re write of the entire promira solution to utilize a single industry standard relational database and a consolidated object model to enable a persistent store 
we estimated that it would incur million to million in r d costs over the two years following the acquisition to develop this project on a successful and timely basis 
the second in process project entailed developing a completely new configuration product that was aimed at the intelligent creation of complex bills of material and planned for introduction by the end of fiscal this technology would also help meet the needs of the high tech  industrial and discrete manufacturers in the markets that we were entering 
we estimated that it would incur million to million in costs  over a two year period following the transaction  to develop this project on a successful and timely basis 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions in financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions were used in the determination of the value of the acquired promira assets 
in addition  we employed an independent appraiser to determine the allocation of the purchase price to the acquired intangible assets 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the contribution the purchased in process technology will make to developing commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from revenues of the successfully developed products and discounting the net cash flows to their present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
total revenues resulting from the promira acquisition were projected to exceed million within five years  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d stage products 
estimated revenue from promira s existing technologies was expected to nearly double in fiscal  grow approximately in fiscal  then rapidly decline as the in process r d projects were completed and existing technology rapidly approached obsolescence as a result of new product innovations developed by us 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were expected to peak in fiscal and then decline as other new products and technologies were expected to enter the market 
these revenue levels reflected the benefits expected from the continued rapid growth of the supply chain planning market as forecast by industry and market analysts  access to new markets and industries  leveraging of our anticipated growth of sales and marketing resources and our anticipated global expansion 
cost of sales and operating expenses were estimated based upon industry levels and management s expectations  in conjunction with our then normal operating history 
we expected that the promira products would generate net profit margins of to by fiscal this margin improvement was expected to derive from the improved attractiveness of promira s planned products as well as economies of scale derived from our sales force and markets 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value are based on cost of capital calculations 
we adjusted the discount rates to address the risks inherent in developing the acquired technologies 
accordingly  we used the following ranges of discount rates to address the various levels of risk percent for the existing products and technology and to percent for the in process technologies 
these risk adjusted discount rates are based upon the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the stage of completion of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology and the uncertainty of technological advances 
as we experienced execution and performance problems during the course of fiscal  management decided to bypass the second planned release of the first in process technology project and incorporate these planned capabilities directly into the subsequent third planned release of the first in process technology project 
this decision was made in the second quarter of fiscal we believed that this strategy would enable us to accelerate the delivery of this release of the in process technology incorporating the simultaneous constraint based capabilities and would yield greater net economic benefits to us 
because the second planned release of the first in process technology project was bypassed  it generated no revenues or expenses 
the third planned release of the first in process project was originally planned and  subsequently released in fiscal we also decided in january not to further develop the new configuration product originally scheduled for release at the end of fiscal 
this project generated no revenues and it incurred approximately  in costs during fiscal although we believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts are reasonable  no assurance can be given that actual results will reflect the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  the events associated with such projects or used to value the in process technologies 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from the projected results 
other income net fiscal year ended february or change change other income    percentage of total revenues other income includes interest income from short term investments  interest expense from short term borrowings  foreign currency exchange gains or losses and other gains or losses 
other income decreased for the fiscal year ended february  compared with the fiscal year ended february  and february  primarily because we sold investments in the current year to assist in funding operations and the restructuring  thereby decreasing interest income from investments 
provision for income taxes as a result of the loss in fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance against a portion of the net deferred tax asset 
the net deferred tax asset relates to certain domestic net operating losses 
although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred tax assets  management believes it is more likely than not that they will be realized through future taxable earnings 
in fiscal  we recorded a loss as a result of the write off of purchased research and development associated with the acquisition of promira 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal year ended february or change change working capital    we have historically financed our growth through funds generated from operations  proceeds from offerings of capital stock and to a lesser extent  short term borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
the increase in working capital for fiscal as compared to fiscal  resulted principally from an increase in cash and cash equivalents and decreases in accounts payable and restructuring accruals  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
the decrease in working capital for fiscal as compared to fiscal  resulted principally from decreases in cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and accounts receivable and increases in accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
our operating activities provided net cash of million for the fiscal year ended february  primarily because the non cash operating expenses and the changes in assets and liabilities exceeded the net loss for the period 
our investing activities used cash of approximately million for the fiscal year ended february   primarily because of the capitalization of software development costs and the purchase of fixed assets and software licenses  which were partially offset by the sale of marketable securities 
financing activities provided net cash of approximately million for fiscal year ended february   consisting primarily of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases of stock through our employee stock purchase plan which were partially offset by a reduction in short term borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
we have an unsecured revolving credit facility with a commercial bank 
under the terms of the facility  we may request cash advances  letters of credit or both in the aggregate amount of up to million 
we may make borrowings under the facility for short term working capital purposes or for acquisitions acquisition related borrowings are limited to million per acquisition 
the facility contains certain financial covenants that we believe are generally typical for a facility of this nature and amount 
this facility will expire in september  unless renewed 
as of february   million was outstanding on the revolving credit facility  including letters of credit 
subsequent to year end  we repaid the million outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
for the fiscal year ended february   we incurred a loss of approximately million 
as noted above  we restructured certain of our business operations during the second half of fiscal to reduce operating expenses  continue our efforts to improve execution and efficiencies  better align expenses with revenues and enhance our sales and marketing activities to meet the challenges of the marketplace 
we believe that our existing cash balances and marketable securities  anticipated funds generated from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility and other possible sources of funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity and working capital requirements in the near term 
we anticipate that  in light of our operating results for fiscal  the cost of any additional funds which we might obtain  might be greater than funds available to us under our existing revolving credit facility or otherwise 
in the event that we require additional financing and are unable to obtain it on terms satisfactory to us  our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
we believe that inflation did not have a material effect on our results of operations in fiscal litigation we are involved from time to time in disputes and litigation in the ordinary course of business 
we do not believe that the outcome of any pending disputes or litigation will have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
however  an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we have established accruals related to such matters that are probable and reasonably estimable 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating us and our business 
our operating results have varied in the past and might vary significantly in the future because of factors such as domestic and international business conditions or the general economy  the timely availability and acceptance of our products  technological change  the effect of competitive products and pricing  the effects of marketing announcements by competitors or potential competitors  changes in our strategy  the mix of direct and indirect sales  changes in operating expenses  personnel changes and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
furthermore  clients may defer or cancel their purchases of our products if they experience a downturn in their business or if there is a downturn in the general economy 
potential for significant fluctuations in quarterly results  seasonality we typically ship software products shortly after license agreements are signed and  therefore  we do not maintain any material contract backlog 
furthermore  we have typically recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of a quarter 
as a result  license fee revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and we cannot predict license fee revenues for any future quarter with any significant degree of certainty 
we have experienced and might continue to experience from time to time very large  individual license sales that can cause significant variations in quarterly license revenues 
our license fee revenues are also difficult to forecast because the market for business application software products is evolving rapidly and our sales cycles vary substantially from client to client 
the sales cycles depend  in part  on the nature of the transactions  including the breadth of the solution to be licensed and the organizational and geographic scope of the licenses 
because the licensing of our products generally involves a significant capital expenditure by the client  our sales process is subject to the delays and lengthy approval processes that are typically involved in such expenditures 
in addition  we expect that sales derived through indirect channels will be harder to predict in timing and size than for direct sales because there is less direct contact and influence with the prospective client 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle associated with the licensing of our products varies substantially from client to client and typically lasts between six and twelve months  during which time we might devote significant time and resources to a prospective client  including costs associated with multiple site visits  product demonstrations and feasibility studies and might experience a number of significant delays over which we have no control 
we base our expense levels upon anticipated future revenues 
a substantial portion of our revenues in any quarter is typically derived from a limited number of large contracts 
therefore  if revenues in a period are below expectations  operating results are likely to be adversely affected  which occurred throughout fiscal and fiscal net income might be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenues because a proportionately smaller amount of our expenses varies directly with revenues 
we have generally realized lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter ending in may than in the immediately preceding quarter 
we believe that these fluctuations are caused primarily by client budgeting and purchasing patterns and by our sales commission policies  which compensate personnel for meeting or exceeding annual and other performance quotas 
competition the market for business application software is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
the intensity of competition has increased and is expected to further increase in the future  particularly within the bb electronic commerce industry 
this increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  longer sales cycle  lower average sales prices and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our products 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
many application software vendors offer products that are directly competitive with the software products marketed by us 
in addition  because of the relatively low barriers to entry in the application software market  we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies  as the application software market continues to develop and expand 
also  our customers and partners may become competitors in the future 
some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other competitive resources than us  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers and have extensive knowledge of our industry 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than can we 
certain competitors have also attempted to raise concerns regarding our viability given our recent losses 
certain erp system vendors have acquired supply chain planning software companies  products or functionality or have announced plans to develop new products or to incorporate additional functionality into their current products that  if successfully developed and marketed  could compete with the products offered by us 
furthermore  current and potential competitors may make acquisitions of other competitors or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the supply chain planning needs of our prospective clients 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
if this were to occur our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
risks of a developing market we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from licenses for supply chain planning software and related services 
however  we are investing significant resources in developing and marketing broader functionality with e commerce technology 
the market for this broader functionality may not develop as significantly as expected or competitors might develop superior technologies  products or both  each of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
dependence on new products and rapid technological change  risk of product defects the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new product introductions  rapid changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
we believe that our future financial performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our products  develop new products that achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding and evolving range of client requirements 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product enhancements that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards  that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these products or that our new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of prospective clients and achieve market acceptance 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to successfully develop and introduce new products or product enhancements  our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our software suite incorporates some software code from third party affiliates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to use these third party software codes nor that we will be able to identify  license and integrate replacement products 
in addition  software products as complex as those offered by us might contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or when new versions are released 
there can be no assurance  despite testing by us and by current and prospective clients  that errors will not be found in new products or product enhancements after commercial release  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
lack of product diversification our future results depend on continued market acceptance of supply chain planning software and services as well as our ability to continue to adapt and modify this software to meet the evolving needs of our prospects and clients 
any reduction in demand or increase in competition in the market for supply chain planning software products could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
intellectual property and proprietary rights we regard our software as proprietary and rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  license agreements  confidentiality agreements with employees  nondisclosure and other contractual requirements imposed on our clients  consulting partners and others and other methods to protect proprietary rights in our products 
there can be no assurance that these protections will adequately protect our proprietary rights or that our competitors will not independently develop products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be licensed do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
there has also been a substantial amount of litigation in the software industry and the internet industry regarding intellectual property rights 
it is possible that in the future  third parties may claim that we or our current or potential future products  infringe their intellectual property 
we expect that software product developers and providers of electronic commerce solutions will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could seriously harm our business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
although we believe that our products  trademarks and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
expansion of indirect channels we are developing and maintaining significant working relationships with complementary vendors  such as consulting firms that we believe can play an important role in marketing our products 
we are currently investing and intend to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these relationships  which could adversely affect our operating margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract organizations that will be able to market our products effectively  that they will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective client support and services or that current partners will continue to promote and or license our solutions 
in addition  difficulties experienced by these complementary vendors in selling our products and services may adversely affect our results of operations 
furthermore  our arrangements with these organizations are not exclusive and  in many cases  may be terminated by either party without cause and many of these organizations are also involved with competing products 
certain erp system vendors have acquired supply chain planning software companies  products or functionality or have announced plans to develop new products or to incorporate additional functionality into their current products that would compete with our products 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any organization will continue its involvement with us and our products 
the loss of relationships with important organizations could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  if we are successful in selling products as a result of these relationships  any material increase in our indirect sales as a percentage of total revenues would be likely to adversely affect our average selling prices and operating margins because of the lower unit prices that we receive when selling through indirect channels 
certain risks associated with acquisitions from time to time  we have investigated potential candidates for acquisition  joint venture opportunities  business combinations or other relationships on an ongoing basis and have engaged in the evaluation of and discussions with  one or more such candidates 
acquisitions involve the integration of companies that have previously operated independently 
if we should effect any acquisitions  there can be no assurance that the we will be able to integrate these or any future employees or operations effectively or that we will realize the expected benefits of any such transactions or business combinations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will not experience the loss of key employees of any future acquired operations 
our process of integrating acquired employees and operations might result in unanticipated operational difficulties and expenditures 
as discussed under the section titled purchased research and development of this document  in  we experienced difficulties with the integration of the respective products and operations of promira and tyecin 
these difficulties included difficulty in integrating the prior promira sales forces and delayed releases for the in process technology acquired as part of the acquisition 
in addition  as a result of the poor financial performance we experienced in fiscal  the technology acquired in conjunction with the tyecin acquisition was not integrated into our solutions and therefore  revenues generated from this technology have been nominal 
international operations we currently conduct operations in a number of countries in europe  asia pacific  japan and south america that require significant management attention and financial resources 
if these operations are unable to generate  maintain or increase demand for our products  then our operating results could be adversely affected 
certain risks are inherent in international operations 
although the majority of our contracts are denominated in us currency  most of the revenues from sales outside the united states have been denominated in foreign currencies  typically the local currency of our selling business unit 
we anticipate that the proportion of our revenues denominated in foreign currencies will increase 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could result in losses from foreign currency fluctuations 
in connection with transactions denominated in foreign currency  we have taken steps to minimize the risks associated with such foreign currency in the past and might take such steps in similar circumstances in the future 
with respect to our international sales that are us dollar denominated  currency fluctuations could make our products and services less price competitive 
our international sales and operations might be adversely affected by the imposition of government controls  changes in financial currencies such as the unified currency known as the european monetary unit  political and economic instability  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and general economic and currency exchange rate conditions in foreign countries 
risks associated with the european monetary union emu our foreign exchange exposure to legacy sovereign currencies of the participating countries in the emu will include foreign exchange exposures to the euro 
although we are not aware of any material adverse financial risk consequences of the change from legacy sovereign currencies to the euro  the conversion may result in problems  which may have an adverse impact on our business since we may be required to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy these problems 
limited management history  recent senior management changes we have experienced recent significant changes in our senior management team 
the majority of our senior management team has worked together for less than one year 
gregory j 
owens  our chief executive officer  joined us in april with one exception  all of our other present executive officers joined us after mr 
owens 
our success depends on the ability of our management team to work together effectively 
our business  revenues and financial condition will be materially adversely effected if our new senior management team does not manage us effectively or if we are unable to retain our senior management 
dependence upon key personnel the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we do not have long term employment contracts with any of our executive officers 
we do not maintain key person insurance on any of our executive officers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key personnel 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract  assimilate and retain highly qualified sales  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can attract  assimilate or retain such personnel in the future 
if we lose talented personnel in key positions and are unable to replace such personnel in a timely manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
stock option repricing in response to the poor performance of our stock price  we offered to reprice employee stock options  other than those held by our executive officers or directors  effective january   to bolster employee retention 
the effect of this repricing resulted in approximately million shares being repriced and the four year vesting period starting over 
the repricing may have a material adverse impact on future financial performance based on the amendment to the accounting principals board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which requires us to record compensation expense associated with the change in the price of these options 
possible volatility of stock price factors such as announcements of new products or technological innovations by us or our competitors  as well as quarterly variations in our operating results  have caused and may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many high technology stock issues and which have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic conditions  have at certain times adversely affected the market price of our common stock and are likely to do so in the future 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this annual report on form k annual report contains certain forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
in addition  we may publish forward looking statements from time to time relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects and strategies  sales and marketing efforts  technological developments  new products  research and development activities  consulting services and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward looking statements in this annual report or elsewhere 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect our business  operating results or financial condition include those set forth above under factors that may affect future results and the following revenues for any period depend on the number  size and timing of license agreements 
the number  size and timing of license agreements depends in part on our ability to hire and thereafter  to train  integrate and deploy our sales force effectively 
the size and timing of license agreements is difficult to forecast because software sales cycles are affected by the nature of the transactions  including the breadth of the solution to be licensed and the organizational and geographic scope of the licenses 
in addition  the number  size and timing of license agreements also may be affected by certain external factors such as general domestic and international business or economic conditions  including the effects of such conditions on our customers and prospects or competitors actions 
a small variation in the timing of software licensing transactions  particularly near the end of any quarter or year  can cause significant variations in software license revenues in any period 
we believe that the market for supply chain planning software continues to expand  although more slowly than in prior periods 
however  if market demand for our products does not grow as rapidly as we expect  revenue growth  margins or both could be adversely affected 
if competitors make acquisitions of other competitors or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance the ability of their products to address the supply chain planning needs of prospects and customers or other software vendors that have announced plans to develop or incorporate functionality that could compete with our products successfully develop and market such functionality  revenue growth could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract complementary software vendors  consulting firms or other organizations that will be able to market our products effectively or that will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and services 
in addition  there can be no assurance that a sufficient number of organizations will continue their involvement with us and our products and the loss of current relationships with important organizations could materially adversely affect our results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 
foreign currency 
in the year ended february   we generated approximately of our revenues outside of the americas 
international sales are usually made by our foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies and the expenses incurred by the foreign subsidiaries are also typically denominated in their local currencies 
in certain circumstances  we enter into foreign currency contracts with banking institutions to protect large foreign currency receivables against currency fluctuations 
when the foreign currency receivable is collected  the contract is liquidated and the foreign currency receivable is converted to us dollars 
interest rates 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio of available for sale instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
these instruments include  but are not limited to  money market instruments  bank time deposits and taxable and tax advantaged variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities and national  state and local government agencies  in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
the fair value of securities held at february  was approximately million 
we also hold cash balances in accounts with commercial banks in the united states and foreign countries 
these cash balances represent operating balances only and are invested in short term time deposits of the local bank 
operating cash balances held at banks outside the united states are denominated in the local currency 
many of our investments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
when interest rates fall  our income from investments in variable rate securities declines 
when interest rates rise  the fair market value of our investments in fixed rate securities declines 
we attempt to mitigate risk by holding fixed rate securities to maturity  but should our liquidity needs force us to sell fixed rate securities prior to maturity  we may experience a loss of principal
