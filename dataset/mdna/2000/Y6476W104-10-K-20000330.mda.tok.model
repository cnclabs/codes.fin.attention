in connection with the distribution described above  omi became a decontrolled corporation and its shipping income is no longer subject to united states federal income tax 
the provision for taxes for the year ended december   reflects adjustments to actual for taxes 
omi s fleet omi s fleet comprises vessels  including three chartered in vessels and one jointly owned vessel  and excluding a jointly owned bulk carrier and an aframax  both of which were sold in the first quarter of omi has concentrated its fleet in two classes of vessels  suezmax and product tankers 
omi has been implementing its plan for fleet renewal with the delivery of four new suezmax vessels in the summer of and january  and two deliveries in including the suezmax tanker described below 
during july and september  two  deadweight tons dwt product carrier newbuildings were delivered 
the company s fleet currently consists of three wholly owned suezmax tankers  three chartered in suezmaxes  one jointly owned ultra large crude carrier ulcc  three panamax product tankers currently carrying crude oil and twelve handysize product carriers transporting clean products 
recent activities on february   the company finalized its refinancing of bank debt with its lenders in the amount of million 
the effect of the refinancing revises debt covenants  increases interest rate margins and reduces principle amortization see financing activities 
during february  omi agreed to sell in a private placement to four unrelated investors   shares of omi common stock for per share per share net of commissions 
the funds raised will be used to partially finance vessels delivered in in october  omi agreed to acquire from mega tankers newbuilding as  a suezmax tanker  which was under construction 
the purchase price of the vessel is approximately million 
the company issued  shares of common stock in november and an additional  shares in february valued at per share 
on march   omi entered into an agreement for a million credit facility to finance this vessel upon delivery from the yard 
the vessel was delivered on march  and the remaining balance of approximately million was paid by the company 
during the first quarter  omi sold its investment in geraldton navigation company inc geraldton for approximately million  after receiving a dividend from the joint venture of million 
a loss of million was recorded for the year ended december  relating to the disposal of this venture 
on september   omi sold its percent share in its white sea holdings  inc white sea joint venture for approximately million

on july  and september   the seine and the isere  two product tanker newbuildings  were delivered at an approximate cost of million each 
both vessels were time chartered for two year periods 
during january  the company took delivery of a suezmax newbuilding  the columbia  and on june   the company completed a sale leaseback of this vessel for million 
as a result of market conditions  omi disposed of its older suezmax vessels and non core vessels 
by doing this  the company is better able to focus its capital where its resources can provide higher returns 
during july  august and november  omi sold four of its single hull suezmax vessels built in the mid s 
these vessels were held for sale at their net realizable values on june  and adjusted to actual sales prices at their sale dates in during december  the company entered into an agreement to sell omi s s built aframax vessel which was also held for sale at its fair value at june  the aframax vessel was delivered to the new owners in march nine vessels including the aframax vessel have been classified as assets to be disposed of at december  the disposal of these vessels are expected during the next two years 
an additional non recurring item included in the operating loss is the provision for losses on the company s chartered in vessels 
an accounting adjustment was required because current lease obligations exceeded estimated future cash flows 
in march  the company made an investment of million to acquire approximately percent of the equity in marineprovider asa  a new internet business to business provider of marine services  which is based in norway 
omi announced on march   the creation of sealogistics 
com a neutral electronic exchange for the shipping industry 
sealogistics will offer a broad range of content and services for the entire shipping industry and will initially focus on on line chartering for the shipment of crude oil and petroleum products 
having received positive responses from major charterers and shipowners  sealogistics is in discussions with them to determine levels of participation 
it expects to be on line during the fourth quarter of market alliances omi has planned to concentrate its fleet in two classes of vessels  suezmax and product tankers 
by concentrating on these two fleets  omi is implementing its plan to consolidate shipping activities by the formation of alliances and pools with other owners 
rates for both classes of vessels were historically low because of the imbalance of the supply and demand for crude oil and refined products and various factors detailed in the market overview 
the company has identified the advantages of owning a large modern suezmax fleet and has been implementing strategies to maximize earnings 
first  the fleet will be more attractive to large customers by providing better scheduling opportunities 
a large fleet also provides opportunities to obtain contracts for large volume movements and creates the potential to increase vessel utilization 
second  large and concentrated fleets create economies of scale to spread efficiently the overhead costs associated with environmental regulations and inspections 
third  operating expertise and efficiency are enhanced by concentration in certain vessel classes 
fourth  omi believes that large customers will prefer to deal with a limited number of large shipping companies with fleets that they have inspected for quality  rather than smaller shipping companies characteristic of the fragmented international tanker market 
in  in order to increase the company s market opportunities in the suezmax trades in the atlantic basin  omi and frontline ltd  a norwegian owner of the world s largest suezmax fleet  combined suezmax tanker fleets for commercial purposes and created alliance chartering llc alliance 
alliance s control of the largest modern fleet of suezmaxes has enabled it to strengthen relationships and obtain contracts with customers 
these contracts may allow alliance the opportunity to increase its suezmax fleet utilization through backhauls  when cargo is available  which can improve vessel earnings 
omi s strategy for its handysize fleet is to increase market share by consolidating commercial operations of vessels through marketing joint ventures and through concentrating trading in selected areas 
in march  the company agreed with osprey maritime limited  a major international shipping company based in singapore  to consolidate their product tanker operations  establishing international product carriers limited ipc to form a mid size product tanker venture 
the joint venture began operating effective may  ipc is expanding the pool to include other product carrier owners to enhance its marketing capacity 
currently all of omi product carriers except the two new product carriers which are on time charter are operating under adjustable rate time charters with ipc 
market overview suezmax tanker overview average time charter equivalents tce in the suezmax market fell in to their lowest level since this was the result of substantially lower volumes of oil transported due to the adherence by opec and some non opec oil producers to their agreed oil production cuts  the fact that a high proportion of these cuts involved long haul middle east oil  substantially higher bunker prices and the draw down of oil inventories at the same time the tanker fleet continued to grow 
freight rates for suezmax tankers have improved in early the crude tanker market is expected to benefit this year as a result of the need to transport substantially more oil to satisfy considerable oil demand  at a time that oil inventories are at very low levels 
however  a sustained improvement of freight rates in the tanker markets will be largely dependent upon the continuous improvement of economic activity in the pacific region  as well as the increase in the rate of tanker scrapings  in view of the relatively high tanker newbuilding deliveries in the last two years and the substantial deliveries expected in the year the world tanker fleet grew and totaled approximately million dwt at the end of  up by million dwt or from the year end level  due to substantial newbuilding deliveries  offset in part by increasing scrapping activity 
at the same time  the tanker orderbook stood at million dwt  or of the existing fleet 
approximately million dwt is scheduled for delivery in  million dwt in the year and most of the balance in the tanker orderbook includes suezmaxes of about million dwt  or of the existing suezmax fleet  and vlccs of million dwt  or of the existing vlcc fleet 
however  approximately million dwt  or one third of the total tanker fleet  was or more years old at the end of in addition  suezmax tankers of million dwt  or about of the existing suezmax tanker fleet  and million dwt  or of the existing product tanker fleet  were or more years old 
the fall in tanker freight rates has led to increasing scrapping activity as well as restraint in ordering new tonnage as compared to the previous two years 
tanker sales for scrap totaled about million dwt in  more than double the amount sold for scrap in  while new orders totaled million dwt 
the sales for scrap include vlccs and suezmaxes 
tanker scrapping activity has been strong in the first two months of as about million dwt of tonnage was sold for scrap  including suezmaxes and vlccs 
tanker scrapping activity should continue at high levels given the relatively high orderbook  the tanker fleet age  high bunker prices which penalize fuel inefficient old tonnage  an expensive fifth special survey and stricter environmental regulations 
world oil demand increased by about million barrels per day b d in  and is expected to grow by about million b d in the expected increases reflect further oil demand growth in industrialized areas and the pacific region as economic activity is recovering from the recent financial crisis 
world oil inventories increased substantially in  especially in the first half of the year  but fell for most of and currently are at very low levels 
world commercial oil stocks at the end of are at the low level prevailing at the end of as a result of the current very low oil inventory levels and the expected considerable world oil demand gains in  a substantial increase of oil production by opec and non opec producers will be necessary this year 
most of the oil production gains are expected in west africa  latin america and the long haul middle east 
product tanker overview freight rates in the product tanker market fell throughout and in the fourth quarter were at the lowest level since the same period in this was the result of product tanker fleet expansion  product inventory reductions  and moderate world oil demand growth as the economies of western europe slowed down and oil demand in southeast asia  though improving  was still below the level prevailing prior to the recent economic crisis 
the world product tanker fleet increased and totaled million dwt at the end of  up by million dwt or from the year end level  while tonne mile demand for product tankers increased by only 
the product tanker orderbook stood at million dwt or of the existing product tanker fleet 
approximately million dwt are scheduled for delivery in  million dwt in and the balance in the year and beyond 
following large opec and non opec oil production cuts  world commercial oil inventories at year end have fallen to the low levels prevailing at the end of at the same time  oil inventories in the three major markets united states  europe and japan are at the lowest levels in over ten years 
oil stocks are expected to decrease further in the first quarter of with the fall expected to be larger than the same period last year 
the stock declines are expected to be more concentrated in the atlantic region and mostly in products distillate and gasoline 
as a result  tight distillate and gasoline markets in the us and western europe will create opportunities for more oil product cargoes from the long haul middle east as well as more cargoes from asia to us west coast 
the supply demand imbalance prevailing in the product tanker trades is expected to persist in the short term given the relatively high newbuilding deliveries this year 
however  prospects for recovery in the product tanker sector may be enhanced given the relatively low total orderbook for delivery in the next few years  and some fundamental changes in the pattern of product trades 
furthermore  oil product import requirements are expected to increase in the three major world oil consuming areas north america  western europe and the pacific region in the next few years  as oil demand growth is expected to exceed refinery capacity in these areas 
in addition  a substantial amount of new refinery capacity in south and southeast asia in the next few years will cover part of the increasing oil demand in this area  lowering product import requirements from the middle east 
this will increase oil product exports from the middle east to longer haul western destinations  namely the us and western europe  increasing product tanker tonne mile demand 
results of operations results of operations of omi corporation include operating activities of the company s vessels 
the discussion that follows explains the company s operating results in terms of net voyage revenues and tce 
net voyage revenues are voyage revenues minus vessel and voyage expenses including charter hire expense 
tce are voyage revenues less voyage expenses in a spot charter or voyage revenues in a time charter because fluctuations in voyage revenues and expenses occur based on the nature of a charter 
the company s vessels currently operate  or have operated in prior years  on time  bareboat or voyage spot charters 
each type of charter denotes a method by which revenues are recorded and expenses are allocated 
under a time charter  revenue is measured based on a daily or monthly rate and the charterer assumes certain voyage expenses  such as fuel and port charges 
under a bareboat charter  the charterer assumes all voyage and operating expenses  therefore  the revenue rate is likely to be lower than for a time charter 
under a voyage  or spot charter  revenue is calculated based on the amount of cargo carried  most expenses are for the shipowner s account and the length of the charter is one voyage 
revenue may be higher in the spot market  as the owner is responsible for most of the costs of the voyage 
other factors affecting net voyage revenues for voyage charters are waiting time between cargoes  port costs  and bunker prices 
vessel expenses included in net voyage revenue discussed above include operating expenses such as crew payroll benefits travel  stores  maintenance and repairs  drydock  insurance and miscellaneous 
these expenses are a function of the fleet size  utilization levels for certain expenses  requirements under laws  by charterers and company standards 
insurance expense varies with the overall insurance market conditions as well as the insured s loss record  level of insurance and desired coverage 
voyage revenues less vessel and voyage expenses 
for the years ended december  versus december  net voyage revenues of million for the year ended december  decreased by a net million from million for the year ended december  net voyage revenues of million for the year ended december  decreased by a net million from million for the year ended december  net voyage revenues for the years ended december   and are as follows by market segments in which omi primarily operates 
for the years ended december  in millions voyage revenues crude oil fleet product carrier fleet all other total vessel and voyage expenses crude oil fleet product carrier fleet all other total net voyage revenues crude oil fleet product carrier fleet all other total includes charter hire expenses 
excludes provision for loss on lease obligations of million 
net changes are discussed as follows according to the two market segments crude oil and product carrier in which omi primarily operates 
crude oil tanker fleet at december   the crude fleet consisted of three wholly owned suezmaxes  one aframax vessel and three chartered in suezmaxes  one vessel is on time charter and the remaining vessels are currently operating in the spot market 
during  five wholly owned vessels were classified on the balance sheet as held for sale at june   of which four vessels were sold and one aframax vessel was contracted to be sold in december additionally  one of omi s three wholly owned panamax vessels carried crude oil in both and and the other two panamax vessels began carrying crude oil in may and july at december   omi owned seven suezmaxes  one aframax and chartered in two suezmax vessels 
during and january  four new suezmax vessels were delivered the first one june  a vessel was sold in august and two chartered in vessels were redelivered to their owners in july and december for the years ended december  in millions crude fleet new suezmaxes tce revenues operating expenses charter hire expense net voyage revenues aframax panamaxes tce revenues operating expenses charter hire expense net voyage revenues old suezmaxes tce revenues operating expenses charter hire expense net voyage revenues total crude fleet net voyage revenues four vessels included in this category in and were sold during one vessel chartered in in was redelivered december the columbia  a newly built suezmax tanker  was delivered to the company in january the vessel operated in the spot market during the six months ended june  and at that date was sold in a sale leaseback transaction 
the columbia was bareboat chartered back to omi and continues to operate in the spot market 
net voyage revenues for the crude oil fleet of million for the year ended december  decreased a net of million from net voyage revenues of million for the year ended december  decreases in net voyage revenues in the crude fleet of approximately million were primarily attributable to lower earnings from the four vessels sold in  in addition to lower earnings from a vessel sold in august  lower earnings in for the aframax vessel operating in the spot market and two panamax vessels with higher operating expenses in  and lower earnings from chartered in vessels  particularly one which was drydocked in and earned a lower tce compared to decreases in the crude oil fleets s net voyage revenue were offset in part by increases aggregating million from primarily three items 
first  the earnings of four new suezmax vessels delivered in and second  the increase in time charter revenue from a panamax vessel operating in a marketing pool in and the final item was the redelivery in december of a chartered in vessel  which incurred losses last year 
product carrier fleet the product carrier fleet consisted of twelve handysize vessels at december  and ten handysize vessels in in november  may and july omi placed its three panamax vessels which previously carried clean products  into a marketing pool 
decreases in the product carrier fleet in the first half of pertain in part to two of the panamaxes which were carrying clean products in the first half and thereafter carried crude oil included in the crude oil fleet s operating results in for the years ended december  in millions clean fleet products ipc pool in tce revenues operating expenses charter hire expense net voyage revenues products on time charter delivered in tce revenues operating expenses charter hire expense net voyage revenues total clean fleet net voyage revenue during the year ended december   seven of the company s handysize product tankers were employed in the spot market and three were on time charter 
however  since may   these vessels have been time chartered at the conclusion of their previous charters to a newly formed joint venture  ipc  described in the market alliance section above 
time charter rates from this venture reflect spot market charter rates since they are adjusted periodically with pool profits 
net voyage revenues of million for the year ended december  decreased a net of million from net voyage revenues of million for the year ended december  decreases in net voyage revenues in resulted primarily from lower tce s for three vessels previously time chartered from until august when they began operating in the ipc pool 
this decrease in net voyage revenues was partially offset by increased earnings from the two new product carriers delivered july and september which began operating on profitable time charters beginning from their delivery dates 
other operating expenses 
the company s operating expenses  other than vessel  voyage and charter hire expenses consist of provision for loss on lease obligations  depreciation and amortization and general and administrative g a expenses 
for the year ended december   these expenses increased million to million  from million for the year ended december  the provision for loss on lease obligations of million was recorded at june  and relates to omi s chartered in vessels 
as part of omi s periodic review  the company evaluated the forecasted future net cash flows for vessels with lease obligations 
the company determined that its current lease obligations for the vessels exceeded their undiscounted forecasted future net cash flows 
the loss was measured by the excess of the future lease payments  as set forth in the lease agreement  over the vessels estimated forecasted future cash flows over the lease terms 
increases in operating expenses for the year ended were partially offset by net decreases of million in depreciation expense from the sale of four vessels in and the sale of a suezmax tanker in august increases offsetting decreases in depreciation expense related to depreciation for three suezmax tankers delivered in and two product carriers delivered in g a expense decreased by million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  other expense income 
other expense income consists of loss gain on disposal write down of assets net  loss on disposal write down of joint venture investments  interest expense  interest income and other net 
net other expense increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  loss gain on disposal write down of assets net was a loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a gain on sale of a vessel in august of million during the year ended december  losses due to the sale of five vessels in aggregated million  which included four older suezmax vessels built in and that were sold for scrap and the columbia which was sold in a sale leaseback transaction on june  at a loss of million 
vessels to be disposed of at december   resulted in a loss of million 
the write down of vessels includes the realization of the cumulative translation adjustment for million 
the adjustment relates to two vessels whose functional currency until july was not us dollars 
loss on disposal write down of joint venture investments was million for the year ended december  as mentioned in the recent activities section  omi disposed of its white sea joint venture effective september  at a loss of approximately million and wrote down another joint venture investment  which was terminated in by million also in september omi s investment in geraldton was written down to its net realizable value of million and is included in assets to be disposed of on the consolidated balance sheet 
a loss on disposal of omi s investment in geraldton of million was recorded at december  interest expense increased million for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  the additional interest expense was primarily due to additional borrowings to finance six newbuildings including one which was delivered and million financed during january and subsequently sold and repaid june  in a sale leaseback transaction and correspondingly a decrease in the capitalization of interest on construction in progress 
see financing activities 
during february  mtc paid omi million in full settlement of a note which was due in november at december   the note receivable of million was included with other receivables in current assets 
a loss of million was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations included in other net for the year ended december  equity loss in operations of joint ventures 
equity in operations of joint ventures decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in was primarily attributable to lower earnings from two joint ventures  one which operates one ulcc vessel that was in drydock during the first half of and earned lower revenues due to declines in tce rates in and the other joint venture owning one suezmax vessel also experienced a decline in spot rates and was sold on september  during  the company received an aggregate of million in dividends from joint ventures  million from amazon transport  inc and million from white sea 
during  omi paid million in capital contributions to one of its joint ventures 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle during the second quarter  omi changed its method of accounting for freight on voyage charters 
the accounting change is effective for the period beginning january  and income of million was recorded for the year ended december  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the change in the company s method of revenue recognition for voyages from the load to load basis to the discharge to discharge basis is a more reliable method in recognizing voyage revenue as it eliminates the uncertainty associated with estimating location of the next load port under the load to load basis 
voyage revenue is recognized evenly over the period from the departure of a vessel from its original discharge port to departure at the next discharge port 
balance sheet in january  the company took delivery of a newly constructed double hulled suezmax tanker  the columbia 
at december   there was a balance in construction in progress of million relating to the columbia which was recorded to vessels upon delivery in the columbia was then sold june  for million in a sale leaseback transaction 
the million proceeds reduced debt incurred in january of million and omi has a long term note receivable for million from the sale of the vessel 
additionally  the company maintains million in escrow and million in cash as collateral for a standby letter of credit as required by the lease agreement see commitments 
the aggregate million is included in other assets and deferred charges 
decreases in other assets and deferred charges resulted in part from an extraordinary loss of million  which was recorded for the year ended december  and relates to the write off of the balance of unamortized finance fees on debt that was refinanced in february the delivery of the two new product tankers during increased vessels by an aggregate of approximately million  decreased construction in progress by million  increased long term debt by million and decreased cash by approximately million 
assets to be disposed of  aggregating million  include nine vessels with an aggregate net realizable value of million and an investment in a joint venture of million at december  the effects of the write down of the nine vessels in were as follows decreases to vessels of million  accumulated depreciation of million  other assets and deferred charges of million related to the write off of the remaining balances for vessels prepaid drydock and goodwill  cumulative translation adjustment of million and decreases in retained earnings for the loss on disposal write down of assets of million 
the effects of the adjustment to million net realizable value for the geraldton investment  which was to be disposed of  was a decrease in investment in  and advances to joint ventures of million  an increase in other receivables of million relating to a dividend received from the venture and decreases in retained earnings for the loss on write down of geraldton of million 
the effects of the disposal of four older suezmax vessels in were as follows cash proceeds of million  decreases to vessels of million  accumulated depreciation of million  other assets and deferred charges of million related to the write off of the remaining balances for vessels prepaid drydock and goodwill  and decreases in retained earnings for the loss on disposal of assets of million 
decreases in investments in  and advances to joint ventures  other than from the disposal of geraldton  primarily relate to decreases in investments in two joint ventures that paid dividends of million  as a return on investment in offset partially by additional investment in joint ventures of million 
additionally  the disposal write down of two ventures decreased investment in joint ventures by million 
increases in the current portion of long term debt at december   includes million related to debt associated with assets to be disposed of in accordance with the refinancing agreement with banks completed in february see liquidity and capital resources 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle for freight on voyage charters as of january  on the company s consolidated balance sheets was to increase current assets by million  decrease other liabilities by million and increase total stockholders equity by million 
for the years ended december  versus december  voyage revenues less vessel and voyage expenses net voyage revenues of million for the year ended december  decreased by a net of million from million for the year ended december  product carrier fleet the product carrier fleet consisted of thirteen vessels ten handysize and three panamaxes at december  and rates in the product market began to decline in the second half of  and to minimize decreases due to rate declines in the short term  omi placed three panamaxes which previously carried clean products  into a marketing pool 
decreases in the product carrier fleet in pertaining to the panamaxes relate to a part of the year in which two of the vessels were carrying clean products and the remainder of the decrease relates to decreased rates earned for these vessels in in comparison to net voyage revenues decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decreases were due primarily to the market declines 
other decreases in this fleet relate to the three panamaxes with decreases in net voyage revenue of approximately million which were included in the crude oil fleet s earnings for the entire year for one vessel and approximately twelve months in aggregate for the other two vessels 
additionally  aggregate net voyage revenues decreased approximately million in the first half of compared to for the two panamax vessels when they were operating as clean product carriers 
additional decreases in net voyage revenues were related to six product carriers drydocked for an aggregate of days in versus four vessels for an aggregate of days in crude oil tanker fleet at december   the crude fleet consisted of eight wholly owned vessels seven suezmaxes  and one aframax and two chartered in suezmaxes  all but one of the vessels were operating in the spot market 
in  omi owned six suezmaxes  one aframax and chartered in four vessels one beginning in may as part of a sale leaseback transaction and the other three beginning in the fourth quarter of 
during  three new suezmax vessels were delivered and operated an aggregate of days  a vessel was sold in august and two chartered in vessels were redelivered to their owners in july and december net voyage revenues of million generated by the crude tanker fleet increased a net of million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the net increase in net voyage revenues can be attributed to three reasons three panamaxes with net voyage revenue of million which had been carrying clean products in  net voyage revenues of approximately million from three suezmax vessels delivered in the summer of and an increase in the net voyage revenues due to higher freight rates in earned by the aframax vessel which also incurred days offhire in 
net voyage revenues were reduced by decreases in revenues for the remainder of the fleet as a result of lower rates in the spot market in due to the lower demand for oil  decreases of million in net voyage revenues earned from three of the four vessels chartered in during  decreases of million from the sale of the suezmax vessel in august and decreased revenue due to an aggregate of more offhire days in compared to primarily relating to drydocking 
the net voyage revenues earned by the vessels chartered in were substantially less due to lower current market rates than those prevailing when the leases were fixed 
other operating expenses for the year ended december   operating expenses decreased million to million  from million for the year ended december  the net decrease was due to a decline in g a expenses of million primarily because of relocation accruals and additional professional fees for the anticipated spin off of the company included in the expenses 
the decrease in g a expenses was offset by a net increase of million in depreciation expense from the delivery of three suezmax tankers in  offset by the sale of a suezmax tanker in august and a liquid petroleum gas carrier lpg vessel in may other expense income net other expense decreased by million percent decrease from million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  gain on sale of assets net increased million due to the gain on the sale of a suezmax tanker in august compared to the gain on sale in march of an lpg vessel 
interest expense decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to increases in the capitalization of interest on construction in progress and less interest expense from repayment of debt for the vessel sold in august offset by interest expense on additional borrowings upon delivery of three newbuildings 
other net of million expense for the year represents a litigation settlement for a vessel which was sold in benefits provision for income taxes the income tax benefit of million includes a provision for federal income taxes of million for the period from january  through june  the date of the distribution  net of the benefit of million representing the reversal of deferred income taxes at the distribution date  as the company became a decontrolled corporation 
equity in operations of joint ventures 
equity in operations of joint ventures increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended the net increase was primarily attributed to better operating results for a vessel operating in a percent owned venture  in addition to increase earnings in due to a loss on sale of a vessel in owned by a percent joint venture of approximately million omi s portion of the loss was approximately million offset in part by the gain on the sale of a vessel in the same venture of million omi s portion of the gain was approximately million 
during  the company received an aggregate of million in dividends from joint ventures  million from amazon transport  inc amazon and million from white sea holdings  ltd 
white sea 
additionally  during november  omi received cash of million upon dissolution of a percent owned joint venture and recorded a loss of million from the dissolution of a percent equity interest in a joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash and cash equivalents of million at december  decreased million from cash and cash equivalents of million at december  the company s working capital of million at december  increased million from working capital of million at december  current assets increased million and current liabilities increased million 
current assets increased by million for assets to be disposed of at december   and decreased million in cash and cash equivalents 
current liabilities increased primarily in current portion of long term debt associated with assets to be disposed of at december  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  see results of operations 
the company operates in a capital intensive industry and augments cash generated by operating activities with debt and sales of vessels that no longer fit the company s strategy 
cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from cash used by investing activities of million for the year ended december  cash used by investing activities decreased in primarily due to decreases in additions to vessels of million resulting from the delivery of the three new suezmax vessels in aggregating million  compared to the additions aggregating million 
the additions to vessels primarily were due to payments relating to the delivery of the columbia of million  the delivery of two product carriers for million and construction in progress for a suezmax tanker of million other increases of million in construction in progress were non monetary  omi issued stock
