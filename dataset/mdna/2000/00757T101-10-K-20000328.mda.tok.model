item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes 
overview on january   we sold the assets of our cvs cardiovascular operations  including our mps r myocardial protection system product line  to atrion corporation 
see note sale of cvs operations discontinued operations of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we received approximately million in cash from the sale 
we also granted atrion a nine month option to acquire our principal office and manufacturing facility in allen  texas for million 
atrion exercised the option to acquire the facility during october and the transaction closed on february  we repaid the outstanding mortgage debt on the facility at closing and received net proceeds of million after paying expenses related to the transaction 
no material gain or loss was realized on the sale of the facility 
we leased space  furniture and equipment from atrion until may at the monthly rate of  and paid atrion fifty percent of certain operating expenses 
at that time we moved our operations to a  square foot leased facility in plano  texas  a northeast suburb of dallas 
the expense of moving and transitioning into the new facility was immaterial 
assets of the cvs operations sold to atrion primarily consisted of accounts receivable  inventories  furniture and fixtures  manufacturing tooling and equipment  and intangible assets including patents  trademarks and purchased technology 
the intangible assets also included the rights to the name quest medical  inc  our former name 
we reported a pretax gain on the transaction of million during the year ended december  this pretax gain is net of million of compensation expense recorded as a result of changes made to the stock options held by employees of the cvs operations 
see note stockholders equity of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the pretax gain is also net of an expense of  recorded in connection with sale of the facility to atrion which relates to abated property taxes 
see note sale of cvs operations discontinued operations of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we utilized million of the proceeds from the sale to retire debt and pay expenses related to the transaction 
the cvs operations have been accounted for as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and in june  we completed an agreement with sofamor danek under which we would develop and manufacture for sofamor danek  products and systems for use in deep brain stimulation dbs 
see note product development agreement of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we received a payment of million upon execution of the agreement that was being recognized into income as revenue based upon the estimated completion of the development project 
during the year ended december   we recognized million into income as revenue 
the remaining  was recognized into income as revenue during january due to the termination of the agreement with sofamor danek as a result of the merger of sofamor danek and medtronic  inc in connection with the termination  we also received an additional payment of million from sofamor danek  which was recognized into income as revenue during january the former agreement with sofamor danek fits with our strategy to strengthen and broaden our neuromodulation technology platforms and to ally ourselves with strategic partners who can help us leverage ans core technology into other significant market segments beyond our focus on the chronic pain segment of the neuromodulation market 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be successful in negotiating and consummating research and development agreements with other strategic partners 
in september  the neurological devices panel of the medical devices advisory committee recommended that the fda reclassify totally implanted spinal cord stimulators ipgs for treatment of pain of the trunk and or limbs from a class iii device to a class ii device 
class iii devices typically require a pre market approval pma  supplemented with clinical trials to prove safety and effectiveness of the device  while class ii devices typically require a pre market notification k to demonstrate substantial equivalence to an existing legally marketed device prior to receiving market clearance by the fda 
according to the fda s ode annual report  the average time for pma s was months excluding the one year typically required for clinical trials  or approximately months total 
the ode annual report reported the average elapsed time for a k approval of months in we expected to receive a final reclassification decision from the fda in january but have experienced a delay that we believe is related to the fda s workload 
we received a written progress report dated february  in which the fda stated that it had received adequate information to move forward toward a final decision 
the agency s letter further indicated that there may be special controls available to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the ipg device for treating pain of the trunk and or limbs 
we remain optimistic that the fda will follow the recommendation of its panel to reclassify the ipg and are prepared to move quickly to file the k pre market notification for clearance to market the ipg in the united states if the fda approves the reclassification 
the ipg market for spinal cord stimulation to treat pain of the trunk and or limbs is expected by industry analysts to approach million in  is growing at a to annual rate and is currently dominated by a single competitor  medtronic  inc results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and we reported net earnings of million or

total net revenue from continuing ans operations of million for the year ended december   was million  or percent  above the comparable level of million 
the period includes million of net revenue and the period includes million of net revenue associated with our former development agreement for dbs products with sofamor danek 
net revenue from ans product sales increased percent to million during compared to million in this increase in net revenue from product sales was the result of higher unit sales volume of ans radio frequency stimulation systems used to treat complex pain patterns 
all of the million increase in was the result of higher sales in the united states 
during june  we launched our enhanced radio frequency stimulation system  the renew tm system  in the united states 
we will launch the renew system in international markets during gross profit from product sales increased to million in from million in due to the increase in net revenue from product sales discussed above 
gross profit margin from product sales decreased to percent in compared to percent in due to approximately  of additional costs we incurred from product transition and unexpected lower manufacturing yields related to the renew system during the third quarter of  higher component costs for the renew system  and production downtime associated with our move to our new leased facility in may total operating expenses the aggregate of research and development  marketing  amortization of intangibles and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in and as a percentage of net revenue from product sales increased to percent in from percent in research and development expense increased to million in  or percent of net revenue from product sales  from million during  or percent of net revenue from product sales  reflecting our stepped up commitment to develop products that will expand our presence into other rapidly growing market segments of the neuromodulation market 
this increase during compared to was the result of higher salary and benefit expense from staffing additions  increased consulting expense  and higher test material expense 
these expenditures during were directed toward development of our renew system  which we launched in the united states during june  a silastic spring constant rate intrathecal drug pump  an ipg stimulation system for spinal cord stimulation and an ipg stimulation system for deep brain stimulation 
we expect to complete the development of our ipg stimulation system for spinal cord stimulation during april  and if the fda approves reclassification of the device  we anticipate obtaining k pre market notification clearance during the second half of and would launch the ipg system domestically upon receipt of the clearance 
in addition  we expect to receive ce mark approval for the ipg system in the second half of  at which time we would launch it in european markets 
we also expect to complete the development of our silastic spring constant rate intrathecal drug pump and begin clinical trials in the united states by the end of similarly  we expect to receive ce mark approval on the constant rate intrathecal drug pump by year end  at which time we would launch it in european markets 
marketing expense  as a percentage of net revenue from product sales  increased to percent in from percent in  and the absolute dollar amount increased from million during to million in this dollar increase during was attributable to higher commission expense from increased product sales and a change from distributors to commissioned sales agents in certain united states territories  higher salary and benefit expense from staffing additions  higher expense for education and training of new implanters and expense related to the launch of our renew system 
general and administrative expense increased from million during to million in while as a percentage of net revenue from product sales  decreased to percent in from percent during the increase in the absolute dollars of expense of  during was principally the result of higher salary and benefit expense from staffing additions  higher expense related to investor relations and higher patent legal expense 
amortization of ans intangibles increased from million in to million during due to expense for additional patents we have licensed 
other income increased to  in compared to  in primarily as a result of a  reduction in interest expense due to the repayment of our mortgage debt in february when we sold our facility to atrion corporation 
income tax expense from continuing operations increased to million in from million in due to higher earnings from ans operations 
this represents effective tax rates of percent in and percent in our expense for amortization of costs in excess of net assets acquired goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes  and  when combined with a provision for state taxes  results in the higher effective tax rate during both and compared to the us statutory rate for corporations of percent

gross profit from product sales increased to million in from million in due to the increase in net revenue from product sales discussed above and an increase in gross profit margin 
gross profit margin from product sales increased to percent in compared to percent in due  for the most part  to a  expense during for the write off of ans inventory of previous designs

these expenditures during were directed toward development of our enhanced radio frequency stimulation systems  which we introduced to the us market in june  a silastic spring constant rate intrathecal drug pump  an ipg stimulation system for spinal cord stimulation and an ipg stimulation system for deep brain stimulation 
marketing expense  as a percentage of net revenue from product sales  increased to percent in from percent in  and the absolute dollar amount increased from million during to million in this dollar increase during was attributable to higher commissions from increased product sales  higher training expense for new users of ans products and higher convention and promotional expense

amortization of ans intangibles increased from million in to million during  mostly due to an expense associated with a non compete agreement with the former president and chief executive officer 
other income increased to  in compared to an expense of  in primarily as a result of two factors 
first  interest expense decreased by  during compared to as a result of the repayment of short term notes payable in january from the proceeds of the sale of the cvs operations 
second  interest income increased by  in compared to due to higher funds available for investment due to the proceeds from the january sale of the cvs operations 
income tax expense from continuing operations increased to million in from  in due to higher earnings from ans operations 
this represents effective tax rates of percent in and percent in our expense for amortization of costs in excess of net assets acquired goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes  and  when combined with a provision for state taxes  results in the higher effective tax rate during both and compared to the us statutory rate for corporations of percent 
liquidity and capital resources at december  our working capital decreased slightly from million at year end to million at year end the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to at december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at december  compared to million at december  in january  we received the million payment in connection with the termination of the dbs agreement with sofamor danek 
during february  we completed the sale of our corporate facility to atrion for million 
after repayment of the mortgage debt and expenses related to the transaction  we realized net proceeds of million 
during september  the board of directors authorized increasing our stock repurchase program by an additional  shares to a total of  shares 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of  or an average of per share 
in aggregate  we have purchased  shares under the authorized repurchase programs and  shares are available for repurchase as of march  during the years ended december  and  we issued  and  shares respectively  from our treasury upon the exercise of stock options 
at december    shares remained in the treasury 
we increased our investment in inventories by million to million at december   from million at december  while this is a higher level of inventory than we plan to carry on an ongoing basis  several factors contributed to the increase 
first  we are continuing to transition from our former radio frequency systems to the renew system 
we are continuing to sell the former systems in international markets until the appropriate regulatory approvals are received 
second  we built inventory of renew system components as part of a phased product and geographical launch 
third  we decided to increase our safety stock levels on critical single sourced components due to electronic component shortages experienced during fourth  we began building inventory in anticipation of our launch of the ipg in the second half of we estimate that our investment in inventory will decrease by approximately million by year end we spent million during for capital expenditures and license fees for additional patents and intellectual property we are licensing 
of such expenditures  approximately million were for new furniture and equipment  computer systems  telephone system  manufacturing clean room and leasehold improvements for our new leased facility 
we also spent million during to license additional patents and intellectual property 
the remaining expenditures of million relate to manufacturing tooling and equipment for the renew system and other new products we are developing 
we expect capital expenditures and patent license fees to be substantially less in fiscal and have budgeted expenditures of approximately million 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund all of our operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
cash flows net cash provided by continuing operations was million in  million in and million in although net earnings from continuing operations increased to million in from million in  net cash provided from continuing operations decreased by million primarily due to changes in components of working capital 
during  we used cash to increase our investment in assets such as inventories  account receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets and to reduce our income taxes payable 
for compared to  net cash provided by continuing operations increased by million reflecting improved operating results  deferred revenue associated with our former agreement with sofamor danek and an increase in our income taxes payable not due until march net cash provided by discontinued operations decreased to  in compared to  in the period included only one month of results until the sale in january net cash provided by investing activities decreased to  in from million in while we used cash in investing activities in of million 
the period reflects million of net proceeds we received when we sold our facility to atrion corporation 
we utilized million in for capital expenditures for leasehold improvements  furnishings and equipment for our new leased facility  manufacturing tooling and equipment for our renew system and new products we are developing and licensing fees for patents 
the period reflects net proceeds of million from the sale of discontinued operations 
we utilized million in for capital expenditures primarily for manufacturing tooling and equipment for the new products we are developing and license fees for patents we licensed 
primary uses of cash during were capital expenditures of million and payments to the former owner of the neurostimulation business relating to patents and settlements of million 
net cash used in financing activities decreased to million in from million in while financing activities provided net cash of million in during  we received net cash of  from the exercise of stock options while million was used for share repurchases and million for the repayment of our mortgage debt 
during  we received net cash of  from the exercise of stock options while million was used for share repurchases and million to reduce debt 
during  we received cash of  from the exercise of stock options and million from additional borrowings under short term notes 
we used million during to repay debt 
year we believe our computer software programs  operating systems and manufacturing equipment are year compliant and ready for use beyond the year we are not currently aware of any material year problems relating to any of our material internal software programs  operating systems and manufacturing equipment 
our internal operations and business are also dependent upon the computer controlled systems of third parties such as our suppliers  customers and other service providers 
we believe that absent a systemic failure outside our control  such as a prolonged loss of electrical or telecommunications service  year problems at third parties will not have a material impact on our operations 
however  the failure of our internal systems or the systems of third parties to be year compliant could result in disruptions to our operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  manufacture products or engage in similar normal business activities 
therefore  depending on the scope and nature of the problems  we could be required to devote significant resources to correcting such problems 
the costs associated with remediating any year problems have not been material to date and although we do not anticipate that these costs will be material in the future  we cannot assure you that these costs will not be material 
outlook and uncertainties the following is a safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the matters discussed in this annual report on form k contain statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words expect  estimate  anticipate  predict  believe  plan  will  should  intend and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements appear in a number of places in this annual report on form k and include statements regarding our intent  belief or current expectations with respect to  among other things i trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations  ii our financing plans  and iii our business growth strategies 
we caution our readers that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following product development and market acceptance 
our growth depends in part on our ability to develop and gain market acceptance of new products  including next generation ans products 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to develop successful products  that delays in product introduction will not be experienced  or that once such products are introduced  the market will accept them 
government regulation 
our business is subject to extensive government regulation  principally by the fda 
the regulatory process  especially as it relates to product approvals  can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
see item business government regulation 
single sourced components 
we rely on a single supplier for the computer chip used in the receiver of our stimulation systems 
the supplier of this computer chip has indicated its desire to cease manufacturing and supplying the computer chip in the future  but to date  has not determined when this will occur 
the supplier has agreed to notify us when a date has been determined and allow us to place a final one time purchase order for the computer chip 
in the interim  we are maintaining a higher than normal inventory of the computer chip and are developing a new receiver design that does not use a custom computer chip 
a sudden disruption in supply from the computer chip supplier or another single source supplier could adversely affect our ability to deliver finished products on time 
competition and technological change 
the medical device market is highly competitive 
we compete with many larger companies that have access to greater capital  research and development  marketing  distribution and other resources than we do 
in addition  our market is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid product development and technological change  which could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
intellectual property rights 
we rely in part on patents  trade secrets and proprietary technology to remain competitive 
it may be necessary to defend these rights or to defend against claims that we are infringing the rights of others 
intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive 
cost pressures on medical technology 
the overall escalating cost of medical products and healthcare results in significant cost pressure 
third party payers are under intense pressure to challenge the prices charged for medical products and services 
we rely heavily on medicare and medicaid reimbursement 
any amendments to existing reimbursement rules and regulations which restrict or terminate the reimbursement eligibility or the extent or amount of coverage of medical procedures using our products or the eligibility or the extent or amount of coverage of our products could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential product liability 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of medical devices entail substantial risks of liability claims or product recalls 
reliance on customer distributor 
during  we had two major customers that accounted for percent or more of our net revenue 
sun medical  inc and primesource surgical  inc  each a specialty distributor of ans products  accounted for million and million  respectively  or percent and percent  respectively  of ans net revenue from product sales for the year ended december  while we believe our relations with sun medical and primesource surgical are good  the loss of one or both of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance 
although our year readiness efforts were successful and we have not experienced any year issues to date  we cannot assure you that year issues will not occur at a later date that would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
other uncertainties 
we discuss other operating  financial or legal risks or uncertainties in this form k in specific contexts and in the company s other periodic sec filings 
the company is  of course  also subject to general economic risks  the risk of interruption in the source of supply  dependence on key personnel and other risks and uncertainties 
currency fluctuations substantially all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates in other countries could reduce the demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold  although we do not believe currency fluctuations have had a material effect on the company s results of operations to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our investments or debt instruments 
we invest our cash reserves in high quality short term liquid money market instruments with major financial institutions 
at december   we had  invested in money market funds and  in a certificate of deposit with a maturity date of days from the purchase date 
the rate of interest earned on these investments will vary with overall market rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in the interest rate earned on these investments would not have a material effect on our income or cash flows 
we also have certain investments in available for sale securities 
these investments primarily consist of real estate investment trusts and investment grade corporate preferred securities that are traded on the new york stock exchange 
the cost of these investments is  and had a fair value at december  of  the investments are subject to overall stock market and interest rate risk 
a hypothetical percent decrease in the share prices of these investments from the prices at december  would decrease the fair value by  at december   we had no debt instruments
