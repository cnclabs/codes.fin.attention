brand awareness enhancing the buzztime brand is critical to the company s ability to expand its user base and revenues and potential future profitability 
the company believes that the importance of brand recognition will increase as the number of entertainment web sites grows and has therefore launched its buzztime everywhere campaign

the company s success in promoting and enhancing the buzztime brand will also depend on its success in providing high quality content  features and functions that are attractive and entertaining to users of online game shows and multi player games

the company could become subject to similar legal proceedings in the future 
recent equipment problems the megahertz playmaker  a hand held  radio frequency device used to enter choices and selections by players of qb and other games and programming broadcast via the ntn network is still being used in approximately of ntn s hospitality locations as of december  customers have experienced certain recurring problems with megahertz playmakers related to noise sensitivity and performance of the playmaker s rechargeable batteries 
management believes these equipment problems contributed to a high rate of churn in  and to address these problems  the company introduced a megahertz playmaker in april the megahertz playmaker is manufactured by the manufacturer of the megahertz playmaker 
to date  there have been no significant equipment problems with the megahertz playmakers  however  there is no assurance that such problems won t occur in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
additional personnel the company plans to expand its employee base to manage its anticipated growth 
most importantly  the company intends to hire additional members of its technical and internet sales and marketing teams 
competition for personnel  particularly for employees with technical and internet sales and marketing expertise is intense 
the success of execution of our internet strategy is dependent on hiring and retaining suitable personnel 
competition the company s programming competes generally with broadcast television  direct satellite programming  pay per view and other content offered on cable television 
with the entrance of motion picture  cable and tv companies  competition in the interactive entertainment and multimedia industries will likely intensify in the future 
in  for example  the walt disney company introduced interactive programming broadcast in conjunction with live sporting and other events which may compete directly with qb and our other programming 
the company competes with other content and services available to the consumer on the internet  through america online and other online services 
moreover  the expanded use of online networks and the internet provide computer users an increasing number of alternatives to video games and entertainment software 
ntn seeks to compete by providing its content via a variety of media platforms in addition to maintaining high quality content  features and functions that are attractive and entertaining to users of online game shows and multi player games  thereby establishing a favorable reputation among frequent users 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company can compete effectively 
governmental regulation and legal uncertainties the laws governing internet use and related transactions remain largely unknown 
the adoption and modification of laws and regulations relating to the internet could increase costs and administrative burdens 
it may take years to determine what existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  consumer protection and taxation apply to the internet 
laws and regulations directly applicable to communications or commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent 
the company must comply with new regulations in the united states and other countries where it conducts business 
non compliance with any newly adopted laws or regulations could expose the company to significant liabilities 
potential for technological obsolescence the computer industry and related businesses are marked by rapid and significant technological development and change 
it is possible that the company s interactive technology and services will be rendered obsolete by ongoing technological developments 
there also is no assurance that ntn will be able to respond effectively to technological changes 
dependence on sole source of supply of playmakers the company currently purchases playmaker keyboards from a single  unaffiliated taiwanese manufacturer 
ntn is dependent on the current sole source of supply of the playmakers 
volatility of stock price  recent trading prices historically  the trading price of the company s common stock has fluctuated widely  and it may be subject to similar future fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements regarding litigation  technological innovations or new products introduced by ntn or our competitors  general industry conditions and other events or factors  which are beyond management s control 
in addition  in recent years and months  broad stock market indices  in general  and the securities of small cap companies such as ntn  in particular  have experienced substantial price fluctuations 
such broad market fluctuations also may adversely affect the future trading price of the common stock 
see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters for more information on historical trading prices of the common stock 
effect of outstanding options and warrants at march   there were approximately  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
at march   there were also outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock at current exercise prices ranging from to per share 
substantially all of the shares underlying these outstanding warrants are subject to currently effective registration statements covering the resale of the underlying warrant shares by the holders 
the foregoing options and warrants could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or engage in certain mergers or other transactions  since the holders of those options and warrants can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would be able to obtain additional capital through a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by such options and warrants 
for the life of such options and warrants  the holders are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of the common stock without assuming the risk of ownership 
to the extent the trading price of the common stock at the time of exercise of any such options or warrants exceeds the exercise price  such exercise will also have a dilutive effect on our stockholders  including purchases of the offered shares 
shares eligible for future sale no predictions can be made with respect to the effect that sales of common stock in the market or the availability of shares of common stock for sale pursuant to currently effective registration statements or under rule will have on the market price of common stock prevailing from time to time 
nevertheless  the possibility that substantial amounts of common stock may be sold in the public market may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock and could impair ntn s ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities
