item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors 
overview cv therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of new small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases 
since our inception in december  substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to research and development 
to date  we have not generated any product revenues and do not expect to generate any product revenues for at least several years 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our sources of revenue  if any  for the next several years to consist of payments under corporate partnerships and interest income 
the process of developing our products will require significant additional research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as regulatory approval 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we will not receive product revenue unless we or our collaborative partners complete clinical trials and successfully commercialize one or more of our products 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts and clinical trials  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of regulatory approval 
in order for a product to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us and  in some cases  our collaborators  to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory clearances  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements and obtain market acceptance 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
results of operations years ended december  and collaborative research revenues 
there were no collaborative research revenues for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the collaborative research revenues for the year ended december  were the result of our completion of the research component of our collaboration with biogen during the first quarter of research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in was due to hiring additional employees to provide support for an increased level of activity in our research  development and clinical programs  in addition to greater external costs for the clinical programs 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase over the next several years as we further expand product development efforts and clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in outside legal expenses for a variety of administrative and corporate development activities 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future in line with our research and development activities  and as we advance our lead product candidate toward approval and commercialization 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  we expect that interest income will fluctuate with average investment balances 
our average investment balance has increased as a result of our follow on public offering that was completed in october and our sale of convertible subordinated notes that was completed in march  and therefore we expect interest income to increase at least through december interest and other expense 
interest and other expense decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a charge of  recognized during the first quarter of related to the early retirement of a capital lease obligation offset by a higher average loan balance 
we expect that interest and other expense will fluctuate with average loan balances 
taxes 
we have not generated taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes were approximately million and million  respectively 
because we have experienced ownership changes  future utilization of the carryforwards may be limited in any one fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the federal carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
the state carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before becoming available to reduce our federal and state income tax liabilities 
years ended december  and collaborative research revenues 
collaborative research revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of million of deferred revenue being recognized during  in conjunction with our completion of the research component of our collaboration with biogen 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased outside service expenses associated with ranolazine clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   which were the same as for the year ended december  interest income and interest and other expense 
interest and other income expense  net increased to million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in was due to higher average investment balances as a result of net proceeds of million from our follow on public offering of  shares of common stock that was completed in january the increase was partially offset by a  charge for the early retirement of a capital lease obligation 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private placements of preferred and common stock  public offerings of common stock  equipment and leasehold improvement financing  other debt financing and payments under corporate collaborations 
in november  we completed an initial public offering and raised net proceeds of approximately million 
in march  we entered into two research collaboration and license agreements with biogen that together resulted in cash receipts of million 
in october  we raised net proceeds of million in a private placement of equity securities with bb biotech 
in january  we completed a follow on public offering and raised net proceeds of approximately million 
in december  we drew down an additional million under a general purpose loan facility with biogen 
as of december  the outstanding balance for this note was  interest on this note is payable at prime plus one and one half percent or at december   payable annually  in arrears  each march th 
in may  we entered into a sales and marketing services agreement with innovex inc pursuant to which innovex s parent  quintiles transnational corp  purchased  shares of our common stock for a total investment of million 
in addition  we entered into two promissory notes with quintiles 
the first promissory note in the amount of million may be drawn down by us at nda filing of ranolazine 
the second promissory note shall be a cash amount to be determined after commercial launch of ranolazine 
both notes are convertible into shares of common stock at the option of quintiles upon certain events 
in october we completed a follow on public offering and raised approximately million 
in march  we entered into a purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold to certain purchasers million in aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
the offering of the notes was made to qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act of  as amended 
interest on the notes will accrue at a rate of per year  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
the notes will mature on march  and will be convertible into shares of cv therapeutics common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
we may  at our option  redeem the notes at any time after march  or earlier if our stock price reachs certain defined levels 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  totaled million compared to million at december  the increase was due to the receipt of million in net proceeds from the follow on public offering that was completed in october and the receipt of million from the quintiles stock purchase in may  offset by million used to fund operations and million to retire long term debt 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased research and development efforts 
as of december   we have invested million in property and equipment with the rate of investment having increased last year in line with increased research and development efforts 
this trend should continue for the foreseeable future 
we will require substantial additional funding in order to complete our research and development activities and commercialize any potential products 
we currently estimate that our existing resources and projected interest income  including the proceeds from our recently completed offering of convertible subordinated notes  will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next months 
however  we cannot assure that we will not require additional funding prior to then or that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in our research and development programs  the size and complexity of these programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  our ability to establish and maintain corporate partnerships  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing preclinical and clinical material and other factors not within our control 
we cannot guarantee that the additional financing to meet our capital requirements will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
year many computer systems  applications  information technologies and equipment containing computer related components are unable to differentiate between the year and the year because they were programmed with two digit  rather than four digit  date fields 
accordingly  older computer systems that have time sensitive applications may not properly recognize the year and beyond 
this could cause system or equipment shut downs  failures or miscalculations resulting in inaccuracies in computer output or disruptions of operations  including  among other things  inaccurate processing of financial information and or temporary inabilities to process transactions  manufacture products  or engage in similar normal business activities 
we tested our key computer systems and equipment  including financial  informational and operational systems  and determined that these systems were largely year compliant 
we completed upgrades to the systems which we determined were not year compliant 
to date we have experienced no year related problems with our information or other business systems 
in addition to risks associated with our own computer systems and equipment  we have relationships with  and are to varying degrees dependent upon  a large number of third parties that provide us with information  goods and services 
these include financial institutions  suppliers  vendors  research partners and governmental entities 
to date  we are not aware of any significant year problems encountered by our key suppliers 
the total cost of the year systems assessment and upgrades was funded through operating cash flows and we have expensed these costs 
the financial impact of making the required systems changes was approximately item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
we classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities as fixed rate if the rate of return on such instruments remains fixed over their term 
these fixed rate investments include us government securities  commercial paper  corporate bonds  and certificates of deposit 
we classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities as variable rate if the rate of return on such investments varies based on the change in a predetermined index or set of indices during their term 
these variable rate investments primarily included money market accounts
