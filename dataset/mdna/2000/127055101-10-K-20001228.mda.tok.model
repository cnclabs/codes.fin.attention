item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cabot corporation and subsidiaries the company or cabot is organized into three reportable segments chemical businesses  performance materials cpm  and specialty fluids csf 
the chemical businesses are comprised of the carbon black  fumed metal oxides  and inkjet colorants businesses 
in the past  the plastics business was treated as a separate business unit and its results were separately reported within the chemical businesses 
the plastics business primarily sells carbon black to the plastics industry  either in the form of dry carbon black or pre dispersed masterbatch 
therefore  the company has elected to integrate plastics results within carbon black 
the following discussion of results of operations includes segment sales and operating profit before taxes pbt 
segment pbt is a measure used by chief operating decision makers to measure the company s consolidated operating results and assess segment performance 
cabot s calculation of segment pbt may not be consistent with the calculation of pbt of other public companies and segment pbt should not be viewed by investors as an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles gaap measures of income 
refer to note r of the consolidated financial statements for a definition of pbt and additional segment information 
the following analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with cabot s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
unless a calendar year is specified  all references in this discussion to years are to cabot s fiscal years ended september overview cabot reported diluted earnings per share of in versus in this substantial earnings increase included both strong operating results and one time events 
earnings from operations totaled in  including from discontinued operations and a net charge for special items 
in  special items included environmental charges and plant closure costs partially offset by insurance recoveries 
earnings from operations totaled in  including from discontinued operations and a net charge for special items 
in  special items included charges for capacity utilization and cost reduction initiatives  write offs of certain long lived plant assets  and a gain on the sale of k n energy  inc stock 
earnings from operations totaled in  including from discontinued operations and net income from special items 
in  special items consisted of write offs of certain long lived plant assets and projects offset by a gain on the sale of k n energy  inc stock 
in  cabot benefited from higher volumes in all businesses 
in addition to higher volumes  the chemical businesses experienced increased pricing and lower controllable costs which more than offset higher feedstock costs  negative currency effects  and additional costs associated with the startup of a new fumed silica facility 
cpm contributed to increased operating earnings primarily as a result of higher volumes 
csf and inkjet colorants also reported improvements in operating performance in one time events included the sale of the liquefied natural gas lng business on september  for approximately million  resulting in a net gain of per share 
in july  cabot announced several initiatives focused on improving shareholder value 
these initiatives included cost reduction measures targeted at reducing annual costs by million  plans for an initial public offering ipo of cabot microelectronics corporation cmc  and management s intention to review the ownership structure of lng 
the company s successful implementation of these initiatives resulted in the sale of lng  the ipo and subsequent spin off of cmc  and the realization of million in cost reductions in cabot continues to pursue its strategy of managing costs and developing new products and businesses based on its core competencies 
cabot is also committed to achieving productivity improvements and further refining its business portfolio in order to achieve its objectives of increasing earnings and stock price performance 
results of operations in fiscal  cabot s operating results were comprised of both continuing and discontinued operations 
as a result of the sale of lng and spin off of cmc  these businesses are reported as discontinued operations 
the remaining segments  chemical businesses  performance materials  and specialty fluids  are classified as continuing operations 
cabot s sales for  and were  million   million and  million  respectively  on a continuing operations basis 
in  greater volumes and higher selling prices increased sales by and  respectively  while negative currency exchange effects partially offset these increases and reduced revenue by 
sales decreased million in as compared to due to reduced volumes and lower selling prices in the chemical businesses and negative currency trends 
segment sales chemical businesses performance materials specialty fluids sales by geographic region north america europe latin america asia pacific continuing operations chemical businesses carbon black  fumed metal oxides  and inkjet colorants segment sales segment pbt dollars in millions financial information includes distribution sales and equity in net income of joint ventures 
sales for the chemical businesses were  million in  compared with  million in and  million in in  higher volumes increased sales by 
in addition to greater volumes  improved pricing and a significant cost reduction effort offset the impact of higher feedstock costs and a stronger us dollar 
feedstock costs increased every quarter in fiscal and reached all time high levels in the fourth fiscal quarter of the cost reduction effort which began in the fourth quarter of amounted to million in annual cost savings in fiscal in  diminished pricing in the chemical businesses  unfavorable currency trends and lower volumes offset lower average feedstock costs 
as a result  sales decreased and pbt declined in versus carbon black sales were up from last year on greater volumes and slightly higher prices 
volume growth in all regions  especially asia pacific  which realized volume growth each quarter over quarter  led to an overall increase in carbon black volumes 
while rising feedstock costs and a stronger us dollar negatively impacted carbon black s profitability  greater volumes  significant cost reductions  and improved pricing resulted in an annual increase in pbt of 
in  the fumed silica business was renamed fumed metal oxides fmo to reflect the broadening of its product line to include other oxides 
strong demand for silicone rubbers  cmp slurries  and niche applications continued to drive increases in volumes and sales which were up and  respectively 
the fmo business broadened its product line by constructing a fumed alumina unit in tuscola  illinois 
however  pbt for the fmo business was diminished as compared to  principally resulting from higher raw material costs and additional operating costs associated with the start up of its new silica plant in midland  michigan 
inkjet colorants continued to grow both sales and volumes in during the year  inkjet colorants secured an additional printer platform with a second printer manufacturer 
as a result of the increase in the number of printers and multifunction devices using inkjet colorants  sales increased in outlook for subject to us and global economy fluctuations  the chemical businesses expect to achieve moderate volume growth in all businesses 
the businesses expect demand to remain firm  especially in fmo and certain carbon black markets in the carbon black business expects modest volume growth worldwide  driven primarily from growth in south america and asia pacific 
the continued strong us dollar and high oil prices will likely result in negative comparisons  year over year  for currency and feedstock costs 
it is anticipated that this will be partially offset by some improvement in pricing 
as part of a continuous improvement process  the business will search for cost efficiencies on an ongoing basis  however  these will be modest compared to fiscal efforts 
demand for fumed metal oxides is expected to remain strong in most markets 
in particular  anticipated growth at cabot microelectronics corporation will contribute to increased demand for fumed silica and fumed alumina 
in addition  increased capacity from the midland plant will contribute to cabot s ability to produce higher volumes 
inkjet colorants expects to expand its product line with the introduction of a line of organic colored pigment dispersions intended for use in desktop  wide format  photo  and industrial printing applications 
inkjet colorants will continue to see increases in sales and volumes as the installed base of its printers increases and should contribute modestly to earnings in performance materials segment sales segment pbt dollars in millions financial information includes distributor sales and equity in net income of joint ventures 
performance materials sales were million in  compared with million in and million in volumes increased in due to increased demand for tantalum capacitors by wireless communication companies  personal and handheld electronics manufacturers  and personal computer makers 
volumes also increased due to higher sales of cabot s intermediate products 
improvements in volumes and prices offset increases in tantalum ore costs  resulting in a improvement in pbt 
in  improvements in volumes  prices  conversion  and operating expenses offset increases in tantalum ore costs resulting in a improvement in profitability 
outlook for the performance materials business expects to achieve modest volume growth in increased demand for tantalum will result in higher average raw materials costs for the tantalum business in fiscal year due to previously committed sales volumes  the company will not be able to offset these higher costs in the first fiscal quarter and therefore expects to make a loss in this segment in the first fiscal quarter 
the company is in the process of negotiating customer contracts for the calendar year that may offset its higher raw materials costs during the balance of the year and improve its profitability 
however  the outcome of these negotiations remains uncertain 
specialty fluids segment sales segment pbt dollars in millions specialty fluids sales in were million versus million in and million in higher sales in the specialty fluids business resulted from sales of cesium formate for oilfield drilling applications 
in  cesium formate was successfully used in oil well completion applications 
increased demand resulted in the re starting of cesium formate production that was temporarily suspended in as a result of excess inventory 
customer trials of cesium formate drilling and completion fluids by the oil and gas industry were inhibited in by an oil industry downturn 
outlook for csf continues to aggressively market cesium formate drilling fluids 
though oil prices were significantly higher in  drilling activity in hpht high pressure high temperature wells and drilling activity in the north sea  in particular  has not fully rebounded from the oil industry downturn in however  activity appears to be increasing and is expected to improve csf sales and volumes in discontinued operations cabot reported earnings from discontinued operations of per diluted common share in compared to per diluted common share in income from operations of discontinued businesses  net of tax  for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the million improvement in income in versus was primarily the result of increased sales of cmc and lng 
similarly  increased sales in both segments caused a million increase in income from to the sale of lng and the ipo and spin off of cmc are summarized in note c of the consolidated financial statements 
company summary income from continuing operations income before income taxes was million in  a increase over million in and a decline from million in income in was significantly enhanced by higher volumes in all businesses and cost reduction efforts but was also negatively impacted by special items 
in  special items consisted of an million charge related to plant closing and a million charge to increase the environmental reserve offset by a million pre tax settlement of insurance litigation 
the million plant closure charge included million for severance and termination benefits for approximately employees of the chemical and performance materials businesses and a million charge for other facility closing costs  of which none was paid out in as of september   million was accrued  most of which will be expended in fiscal also included in the charge is million for the impairment of long lived plant assets 
these actions will result in reduced depreciation expense and certain other cost savings 
these expenses are included as special items in the consolidated statement of income 
during  special items included a million gain from the sale of k n energy  inc stock and a million charge for severance and termination benefits for approximately employees and a million charge for the retirement of certain long lived plant assets 
as of september   million was accrued  of which million was expended in these plant closings resulted in reduced depreciation expense and certain other cost savings totaling approximately million 
in  special items consisted of a million asset impairment charge  a million write off in the performance materials segment  and a million gain from the sale of equity securities 
gross margin improved slightly  by million  in due to cost reductions  higher volumes  and higher prices  offset by higher raw material costs and a stronger us dollar 
in  gross margin decreased million as compared to as significant declines in carbon black selling prices offset lower feedstock costs and lower volumes 
operating expenses include research and technical service  and selling and administrative expenses 
research and technical service spending decreased significantly from million in to million in the decrease reflects reduced spending in the carbon black and cpm businesses 
similarly  reduced spending resulted in a million decrease in versus the company anticipates research and technical service spending will increase by an additional million in to reflect the ongoing developmental requirements of its new and existing businesses 
selling and administrative expenses for   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in reflects the success of cost improvement initiatives  particularly in the chemical businesses 
selling and administrative expenses remained essentially flat in as compared to interest expense from continuing operations was lower in due to the repayment of debt 
interest expense was million  million  million in   and  respectively 
other charges  net  decreased from million in to in this decrease was attributable to a gain on the sale of equipment  and lower amortization expense in while included a loss on sale of equipment 
cabot s overall effective income tax rate was in  and in  the company initiated a reorganization of its international legal entity structure 
the impact is expected to result in a lowering of the company s fiscal effective tax rate by 
the underlying factors affecting cabot s overall effective tax rates are summarized in note n to the consolidated financial statements 
cabot s share of the earnings of investments in equity affiliates remained stable at million in and compared with million in net income net income was million per diluted common share in compared to million per diluted common share in and million per diluted common share in the following table summarizes the impact of special items and the gains on sales of lng and equity securities on diluted earnings per common share special items gains on sales gain on sale of lng environmental charges insurance litigation settlements sale of k n energy  inc stock carbon black asset impairment tantalum ore recovery charge cost reduction initiatives programs special items gains on sales per common share diluted excluding special items and the gains on sales of lng and equity securities  net income for continuing operations would have been million in  million in and million in risk management cabot s principal objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes  foreign currency rate changes  share price changes and commodity price changes is to reduce volatility and limit the impact of the changes on earnings 
to achieve its objectives  cabot identifies these risks and manages them through its regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the chemical businesses enter into contracts with customers and suppliers that are designed to limit the risk of certain foreign currency rate and commodity price changes 
cabot enters into certain contracts in the carbon black business in which the price of the product is adjusted to a certain extent based on price movements in feedstock 
certain contracts in cabot s foreign subsidiaries are denominated in us dollars or a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary 
cabot also enters into certain contracts for share repurchases to limit the risk associated with stock price fluctuations 
additionally  cabot attempts to limit its net monetary exposure in currencies of hyper inflationary countries  primarily in south america 
market risk cabot determines its worldwide exposures to interest rate changes  foreign currency rate changes  share price changes and commodity price changes and reduces the impact of rate and price changes through the use of derivative financial instruments 
these financial instruments are designated as hedges of underlying exposures associated with specific assets  liabilities  or firm commitments or anticipated transactions and are monitored to determine if they remain effective hedges 
since cabot utilizes interest rate  foreign currency  and commodity sensitive derivative instruments for hedging  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying transaction 
market risk exposure to other financial instruments is not material to earnings  cash flow  or fair values 
cabot manages market risks pursuant to policies aimed at protecting cabot against risks and prohibiting speculation on market movements 
actions taken by cabot s businesses to provide such protection are reviewed and approved by cabot s risk management committee which is charged with enforcing cabot s risk management policy 
interest rates cabot s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  cabot used interest rate swaps to hedge and or lower financing costs and to adjust fixed and variable rate debt positions through january in january  cabot settled its remaining outstanding interest rate swap 
as of september   cabot had million in cash and short term investments 
it is the company s practice to invest excess cash in instruments that will earn a high rate of return  consistent with the protection of principal 
interest income earned may vary as a result of changes in interest rates and average cash balances  which could fluctuate over time 
a ten percent change in interest rates could cause interest income to fluctuate by approximately million 
foreign currency cabot s international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks  including currency fluctuations and government actions 
operations in each country are closely monitored so that cabot can respond to changing economic and political environments and to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
accordingly  cabot utilizes foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts to hedge its exposure of firm commitments or anticipated transactions  primarily for receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currencies 
cabot also monitors its foreign exchange exposure to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency derivatives programs 
cabot has foreign currency instruments primarily denominated in the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  and australian dollar 
share repurchases cabot takes advantage of opportunities to repurchase shares of its common stock with excess cash at a price that cabot believes is below the fair market value of the stock 
cabot  from time to time  enters into forward agreements for its own stock in order to fix the price of stock for delivery at a future date 
these agreements provide cabot with the right to settle forward contracts in cash or an equivalent value of cabot corporation common stock 
commodities cabot is exposed to commodity price fluctuations that affect its sales revenues and supply costs 
from time to time  cabot entered into commodity futures contracts  commodity price swaps  and or option contracts to hedge a portion of firmly committed and anticipated transactions against natural gas price fluctuations when it owned the lng business 
cabot monitored its exposure to ensure the overall effectiveness of its hedge positions 
in  cabot realized a million loss on futures contracts 
in  cabot realized gains associated with futures of million and losses associated with options of million 
at september   the notional principal amounts of commodity futures contracts  commodity price swaps  and option contracts were million  maturing through august at september   no contracts were outstanding 
value at risk cabot utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential loss in the fair value of its foreign exchange  share repurchases and commodity sensitive derivative financial instruments within a confidence interval 
cabot s computation was based on the interrelationships between movements in interest rates  foreign currencies  share repurchases and commodities 
these interrelationships were determined by observing historical interest rates  foreign currency  share price and commodity market changes over corresponding periods 
the assets and liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated transactions  which are hedged by derivative financial instruments  were excluded from the model 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation 
cabot s computations are based on a monte carlo simulation method 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual gains or losses in fair value that will be incurred by cabot 
the var model estimated a maximum loss in market value of million from october  through october  for foreign exchange derivative instruments held as of september  in  the var model estimated a maximum loss in market value of million for derivative instruments held as of september  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the loss in market value exceeded the estimated maximum loss by million 
financial instruments that subject cabot to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables 
tire manufacturers comprise a significant portion of cabot s trade receivable balance 
at september  and  cabot had trade receivables of approximately million and million  respectively  from tire manufacturers 
although cabot s exposure to credit risk associated with nonpayment by tire manufacturers is affected by conditions or occurrences within the tire industry  the majority of the trade receivables from the tire manufacturers were current at september  receivables with two tire manufacturers each made up of cabot s receivables at that date 
cash flow and liquidity cash generated in from operating activities was million  compared with million in and million in see the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the change in is primarily due to improved working capital as a result of a yearlong working capital efficiency initiative 
the change in is primarily due to an increase in working capital 
capital expenditures on property  plant and equipment  and investments and acquisitions for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
in   and capital expenditures on property  plant and equipment and investments and acquisitions for continuing operations totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the major components of the and capital program included new business expansion  normal plant operating capital projects  and capacity expansion in cabot s fmo  cpm  and cmc businesses 
capital expenditures for are expected to approximate million and include projects for maintenance and replacement  plant expansion  and an enterprise wide systems initiative 
capital expenditures maintenance improvement process improvement new business expansion compliance infrastructure cabot is a defendant  or potentially responsible party  in various lawsuits and environmental proceedings wherein substantial amounts are claimed or at issue 
during the next few years  cabot also expects to spend a significant portion of its million environmental reserve in connection with remediation at various environmental sites 
these sites are primarily associated with businesses divested in prior years 
cash used in in financing activities was million  compared with million in and million in cabot s ratio of total debt including short term debt  net of cash to capital decreased from at september  to negative at september   primarily due to the proceeds of the lng sale 
on september   cabot completed a transaction to sell its lng business for approximately million in cash 
the sale included cabot s lng terminal in everett  massachusetts  its lng tanker  the matthew  and its equity interest in the atlantic lng liquefaction plant in trinidad 
the gain on the sale of the lng segment was approximately million before tax and million after tax 
the proceeds may be used for share repurchase  retirement of debt  investment in existing businesses or acquisitions 
on april   cabot microelectronics corporation  then a subsidiary of cabot  sold million shares of its common stock in an ipo 
the million shares represented approximately of cmc 
the net proceeds from the ipo were approximately million 
cabot received an aggregate of approximately million in dividends from cmc 
on september   cabot successfully distributed its remaining interest in cmc to cabot s shareholders by means of a stock dividend 
on may   cabot repurchased million in cabot medium term notes mtns 
the notes were due to mature august  on june   cabot arranged to buy back million of mtns 
the mtns were due october  and were puttable at par in on september   cabot purchased million of its mtns 
the mtns were issued on october   contained a coupon of  had a maturity date of october   and were puttable at par in on september   cabot s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of cabot s common stock  superseding prior authorizations 
approximately  shares have been purchased under this new authorization as of november  in november  a cabot subsidiary borrowed million euro million from institutional lenders

cabot maintains a credit agreement under which it may  under certain conditions  borrow up to million at floating rates 
the facility is available through january  as of september   cabot had no borrowings outstanding under this arrangement 
management expects cash on hand  cash from operations and present financing arrangements  including cabot s unused line of credit and shelf registration for debt securities  to be sufficient to meet cabot s cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
during  cabot paid cash dividends of per share of common stock 
in november  the board of directors approved an per share dividend on its common stock in the first calendar quarter of new accounting standards cabot is assessing the impact of the following new accounting pronouncements on october   cabot adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  as amended 
fas established accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
fas requires that changes in the derivative instrument s fair value be recognized currently in earnings  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative instrument s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
there were no derivative positions at year end for which cabot would seek to achieve hedge accounting under this pronouncement 
as such  the effect of adopting fas on cabot s financial statements is not expected to be significant 
however  this statement could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec  released staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
in june  the sec released sab b  which postponed the effective date sab to the fourth quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  cabot will be required to be in conformity with the provisions of sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal cabot is currently evaluating the impact that sab will have on its financial condition and results of operations 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on issue accounting for shipping and handling revenues and costs 
amounts billed as shipping and handling are required to be recorded as revenue  however it allows a company to adopt a policy of including shipping and handling costs in cost of sales 
if shipping and handling costs are significant and are not included in cost of sales  a company should disclose both the amount of such costs and which line item on the income statement includes that amount 
the task force also indicated that shipping and handling costs cannot be reported as a reduction in revenue 
eitf is effective for cabot for all fiscal quarters beginning after july  cabot does not expect the eitf to have a material impact on cabot s consolidated financial statements
