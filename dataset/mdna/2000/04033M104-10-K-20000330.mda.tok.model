item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and the accompanying notes set forth on pages f through f overview we are a leading provider of open systems based digital remote access equipment to isps 
our remote access equipment is compatible with open systems platforms running a variety of popular operating systems  including windows nt and linux  and enables isps to build reliable  scalable and easy to manage networks at a cost that is significantly below other available alternatives 
historically  our core strength has been supplying digital signal processing based dsp sub systems to oems and government contractors 
our dsp oem products are incorporated into a variety of applications  including medical instrumentation  machine vision  professional audio  sonar  radar and multimedia 
in the mid s  we introduced a series of data communications products aimed at the computer telephony integration market or cti products 
our initial product  the cti modem  which we still provide to oem customers  is used in internet access  on line services and transaction processing markets 
in  we formed a communications systems group to begin development of an asymmetrical digital subscriber line adsl carrier class product targeting the needs of major telecommunications and network service providers 
as a result of our strategic decision to reposition our company in  we decided to sell our communications systems group  and in september we completed the sale of the group s assets to cabletron systems  inc for approximately million 
in  we also announced our intention to focus on the remote access equipment market through product offerings that provide high density and cost effective remote access solutions based on industry standard pc platforms 
we developed the t modem and t modem plus products  windows nt based remote access solutions  for this market 
target customers for these products were oems that wanted to integrate remote access capability into their computers 
a major pc manufacturer  compaq  adopted the t modem plus remote access solution in march by late  widespread use of the internet and improved internet security led enterprises to outsource their remote access needs to isps 
this led to the decline of compaq s primary remote access market  the enterprise remote access market  and our revenues from compaq decreased from a total of million in to zero for the period ended december  our ability to successfully execute our new business strategy is critical to the future performance of our business 
during the second quarter of we changed our business strategy to focus on the isp market following the decline of the enterprise remote access market 
historically  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from product sales to oem s and pc manufacturers 
as we focus on efforts on the isp market  we expect sales to oems to represent a declining percentage of our total revenue in the future if our business strategy is successful 
because the isp market is a new market for us  and the equipment we have developed for that market has only recently been introduced  we have limited experience in selling our products 
currently  only a limited number of isps have purchased our products 
to expand our international operations  in november we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of solutions for communications and international isdn  sa scii headquartered in paris  france 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and consideration  including related transaction costs  consisted of  in cash 
revenue is derived from the sale of hardware and software products for dsp and remote access applications 
our customers consist primarily of oems  computer equipment distributors and isps 
we recognize revenue at the time the product is shipped to the customer when there is no additional significant post contract customer support obligation

as a result  revenues from compaq declined from million for the year ended december  to zero for the year ended december  the loss of sales to other pc integrators selling to the enterprise market comprised the remaining domestic sales variances from the previous year 
international sales were  for the year ended december  including us exports of  and sales from european subsidiaries of  compared to international sales of  for the decrease is attributable to a reduction in demand by an oem customer for our audio mixing product  as well as a reduction in sales of t modem plus products due to the release of our rs product 
such decreases were partially offset by sales from the company s european subsidiaries 
gross profit increased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the twelve months ended december  gross profit margin was for the twelve months ended december  compared to for the twelve months ended december  the increase in gross profit margin as a percent of sales reflects the continued shift in product mix from lower margin shipments to pc integrators to shipments to oem s customers that carry higher gross margins

we introduced the rs in the fall of which has improved price and performance compared to the rs as a result  we expect to reduce the price of the rs and wrote down inventory to effect lower of cost or market valuation 
gross profit margins were before this write down 
additionally  profit margins reflect a charge of approximately million for the write down of certain inventory primarily related to t modem plus and rs products 
the write down was the result of a substantial reduction in demand from several major customers including compaq 
we negotiated additional sales with compaq in the fourth quarter of and have sought new markets for these products 
however  due to the introduction of the company s next generation rs product family in september  and the company s change in focus from enterprise customers to isps  management expected substantially reduced demand for these products from compaq and other t modem plus customers in and beyond

there was no tax provision for the twelve months ending december  due to losses reported for that period 
for the twelve months ending december  a tax provision of  was recorded to reflect our estimated federal and state income tax liability for income 
this liability was partially offset by the use of the net operating losses we incurred in previous years 
alternative minimum tax rules limit the use of such operating losses to entirely offset our income tax liability 
for the foregoing reasons we reported a net loss of  for the year ended december  as compared to net income of  for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  worldwide sales were  for  an increase of  or from  for domestic sales for were  compared to  for  an increase of  or 
this increase in domestic sales for reflects increased shipments of our remote access rs  t modem and t modem plus products primarily to pc manufacturers 
such increases were offset by decreased shipments of various dsp products 
during  we focused our sales and marketing efforts on the rapidly growing remote access equipment market targeting enterprises and pc manufacturers and going forward  decided to continue to focus on the remote access market 
however  we decided to change the focus of our selling and marketing efforts from pc manufacturer customers and enterprise markets to end users such as isps 
oem customers  who require customized applications of our products  will continue to be a part of our customer base 
sales internationally were  for compared to  for this growth resulted from an increase in export sales of dsp products to existing customers 
sales for remote access products did not increase as rapidly in the international markets because our selling and marketing efforts were largely directed towards the domestic markets 
gross profit decreased  to  for compared to  for gross profit margin decreased from for to for the decrease in margin was due  in part  to the continued shift in product mix from higher margin dsp products to lower margin data communications products as sales to pc manufacturers typically yield lower gross margins

we have incurred substantial operating losses and had an accumulated deficit of  at december  we expect to have operating losses and a growing accumulated deficit in the future 
if we do not successfully execute our business strategy in the isp and oem markets  there is no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet the company s anticipated operating needs for however  we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents together with the proceeds from the sale of securities completed in the first quarter of  see note will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated cash needs through the end of even if our cash requirements vary from those now planned  we believe that our sources of liquidity are sufficient to continue operations through the end of however  if necessary  we may delay or eliminate some expenditures and planned operations may be scaled back or  we may need to raise additional funds to meet obligations

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the results of our operations and the valuation of some of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states and foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
interest rate risk 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  as our investments are in united states dollar cash equivalents and short term instruments 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  because the computation of interest due on our debt in the united states is based on key interest rate indicators used in the united states such as the prime rate 
foreign exchange risk 
we currently have foreign subsidiaries that conduct and report their operations in local currency 
the primary foreign currency is the french franc 
other currencies include the british pound and the german deutschmark 
on january   eleven member countries including france and germany of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing  or local  currencies and one common currency  the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
conversion to the euro eliminates currency exchange risk between the participating member countries 
due to the limited contribution of our foreign subsidiaries to our results of operations  we do not believe we have material market risk exposure

this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
we currently do not hedge foreign currency denominated transactions or enter into any derivative instruments 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the effect of adopting sfas no 
is not expected to be material to our operations 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
among other provisions  sop requires that entities capitalize certain internal use software costs once certain criteria are met 
under sop  overhead  general and administrative and training costs are not to be capitalized
