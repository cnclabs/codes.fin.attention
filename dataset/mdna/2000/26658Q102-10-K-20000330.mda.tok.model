in addition  the company s future operating results are dependent upon the timing and awarding of contracts by the doe for the cleanup of other waste sites administered by it 
the timing and award of such contracts by the doe is directly related to the response of governmental authorities to public concerns over the treatment and disposal of radioactive  hazardous  mixed and other wastes 
the lessening of public concern in this area or other changes in the political environment could adversely affect the availability and timing of government funding for the cleanup of doe and other sites containing radioactive and mixed wastes 
additionally  revenues from technical support services have in the past and continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues and loss of one or more technical support service contracts could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the company s future operating results may fluctuate due to factors such as the timing of new commercial waste processing contracts and duration of and amount of waste to be processed pursuant to those contracts  the acceptance and implementation of the company s waste treatment technologies in the government and commercial sectors  the evaluation by the doe and commercial customers of the company s technologies versus other competing technologies as well as conventional storage and disposal alternatives  the timing of new government waste processing projects  including those pursued jointly with bnfl  the duration of such projects  and the timing of outage support projects and other large technical support services projects at its customers facilities
