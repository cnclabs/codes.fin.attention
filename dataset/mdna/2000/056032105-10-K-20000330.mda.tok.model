item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  sell and support advanced thermal processing systems used primarily in the assembly of pcbs and in advanced semiconductor packaging 
we believe we are the leading supplier of solder reflow systems used by oems and cems 
in addition  we produce advanced high temperature processing systems for manufacturing ceramic components for electronic devices and a variety of specialty applications 
we derive our net sales from customers around the world 
our customers include large multinational oems and cems requiring advanced thermal processing equipment solutions 
in  net sales to our five largest customers accounted for of our total net sales 
our net sales in were dispersed worldwide  with approximately to customers in the united states  to asia pacific customers  to european customers and to customers in the rest of the world 
over the past three years  the percentage of our net sales to international customers has increased from in to in this shift reflects the continued trend toward offshore manufacturing by our us based multinational customers and the successful penetration of new non us based customers 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales of certain items in our consolidated financial statements for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research  development and engineering restructuring charge operating income interest income interest expense other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes income taxes net income fiscal year ended december  as compared to fiscal year ended december net sales 
net sales increased from million in to million in the increase in net sales reflects the higher demand for our products  primarily by our large multinational oems and cems 
this increase in net sales also reflects growth of approximately in the electronics manufacturing market and the gain in market share we have achieved with our medium and high end solder reflow systems 
the percentage of net sales attributable to our customers in the united states declined by  net sales attributable to our customers in europe increased by  net sales attributable to our asia pacific customers increased by and there was a minimal percentage change in net sales in the rest of the world 
the larger growth rate in net sales to european and asia pacific customers reflects the trend toward offshore manufacturing by our us based and multinational customers and our increased sales to overseas domestic manufacturers 
the effect of price changes for specific products has not materially impacted the change in net sales for the periods presented 
gross profit 
gross profit increased from million in to million in and  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from in to in the increase in gross profit for was due to the increase in net sales in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative increased from million in to million in  and as a percentage of net sales  decreased from to 
the higher costs in were primarily the result of a million increase in our net sales 
the higher selling  general and administrative in can be attributed to an increase in customer service support for our worldwide customer base and higher selling expenses 
in  sales commission expense was higher as the number of products sold through agents increased 
warranty costs were also higher in due to our rapid growth and the increase in the use of outside service contractors in the latter part of the year 
in addition  higher bonuses were recorded in compared to  due to the increase in net income 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering increased from million in to million in  and as a percentage of net sales  decreased from in to in in  we increased our investment in new product development 
operating income 
operating income increased from million in to million in  and as a percentage of net sales  increased from in to in in  the increase in operating income was the result of a increase in net sales over in addition  our cost structure for sales  general and administrative and research  development and engineering increased at a lower rate than did the net sales percentage 
income taxes 
income taxes increased from  in to  in our effective tax rates were in and in the and effective tax rates reflect the use of net operating loss carryforwards available to our uk subsidiary  which was profitable in and during and  we recorded the benefit of these net operating losses  resulting in the lower effective tax rates 
our statutory federal income tax rate is fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased from million in to million in the increase in net sales in reflects the higher demand for our products  primarily by our large multinational customers  despite a decline in the overall market for capital equipment in electronics manufacturing during the period 
in addition  we saw an increase in net sales of our large thermal processing systems for the sintering of nuclear fuels 
during  the percentage of net sales attributable to our customers in the united states declined by 
this was offset by a increase in net sales to our asia pacific customers  a increase in net sales to our european customers and an increase in net sales to customers in the rest of the world 
the increase in non united states net sales was due to expansion in production by multinational companies to offshore facilities and our market penetration of non domestic customers

selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative increased from million in to in and  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from in to in the higher costs in were primarily the result of an increase of million in net sales and resulting increased costs for sales and service to support our increasing worldwide customer base 
these increases in costs were offset by a lower overall commission expense as we increased our direct sales and service locations in certain asia pacific countries 
research  development and engineering 
research  development  and engineering increased from million in to million in  and as a percentage of net sales  increased from in to in in  the increase in research  development and engineering was the result of adding and implementing new engineering management resources and technologies 
operating income 
operating income decreased from million in to million in  and as a percentage of net sales  decreased from in to in in  the decrease in operating income resulted from a  one time restructuring charge incurred as the result of the implementation of our strategy to outsource subassemblies and a change in strategy for our sales and service support in certain asia pacific countries 
income taxes

our statutory federal income tax rate is liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  an increase of million compared to december  the increase was primarily a result of cash flow from operations 
we have an unsecured revolving line of credit that allows for aggregate borrowings  including letters of credit  up to million 
we may elect to borrow at either the bank s base rate or the eurodollar rate in effect from time to time 
this loan agreement was extended in until april  and is subject to certain financial covenants 
no amounts were outstanding under this agreement as of december  or at any time in we have a mortgage note that is secured by our real property 
the mortgage note had an outstanding balance at december  of approximately million 
the mortgage requires monthly payments of  which includes interest calculated at the rate of per annum 
a final balloon payment of approximately million is due on july  upon maturity of the mortgage note 
during  we invested approximately million in capital improvements to enhance our information technology infrastructure and to develop several equipment prototypes 
we do not presently have any outstanding commitments for capital expenditures that would have a material impact on our liquidity and future capital resources 
during  we repurchased an additional  shares of our common stock for  this stock buy back program reduced the number of outstanding shares of stock during by 
these repurchases were approved by our board of directors in we expect that our current cash position  ability to borrow necessary funds and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our corporate  operating and capital requirements into market risk disclosure our primary market risk exposure is in the area of foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations as they pertain to invoices for parts and labor in our foreign service locations 
as of december   all of our long term debt and capital lease obligations are fixed rate financial instruments  thus we are not exposed to interest rate risk resulting from variable interest rate of its debts 
other matters the impact of inflation and the effect of foreign exchange rate changes during have not had a material impact on our business and financial results 
recent accounting developments in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides additional guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles for revenue recognition to a company s consolidated financial statements 
sab no 
addresses several issues  including the timing for recognizing revenue derived from arrangements that provide for customer acceptance or product installation after shipment and transfer of title 
our existing revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue at the time the customer takes title of the product  generally at the time of shipment  because we have routinely met our installation obligations and obtained customer acceptance 
applying the requirements of sab no 
to the present arrangements used in our thermal processing systems sales may result in a change in our accounting policy for revenue recognition and the deferral of the revenue for some equipment sales until installation is complete and accepted by the customer 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sab no 
might have on our revenue recognition policies 
however  there will be no impact on our cash flows from operations as a result of this change 
we are required to report the impact of sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
a  no later than the second fiscal quarter of the fiscal year the effect of the change will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  accordingly  the first quarter of year financial results may be restated to the extent that sab no 
is relevant and material 
prior year financial statements will not be restated 
we are also considering potential changes to our standard contracts that could mitigate the impact of sab no 
in the future 
in june  the financial standards accounting board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in income unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the statement of income and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 shall be effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
cannot be applied retroactively 
sfas no 
 as amended  must be applied to a derivative instruments and b certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued  acquired  or substantively modified after december  and  at our election  before january  
we have not yet quantified the impact of adopting sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements and have not determined the timing nor method of its adoption of the statement 
however  we do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
