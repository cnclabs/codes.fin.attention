in addition  a wholesale business was closed and several retail locations were consolidated 
impact of inflation and changing prices it has generally been the company s practice to adjust its selling prices and sales allowances to reflect changes in production and raw material costs in order to maintain its gross profit margin 
in the past three years  costs have remained relatively constant and the company has not found it necessary to implement general price increases 
however  the company foresees a rise in raw material costs in due to increasing oil prices 
accordingly  the company may adjust prices in the near future 
the company s gross profit margin could be negatively impacted if resulting price adjustments fail to fully offset any increase in raw material costs 
replacement of fixed assets requires a greater investment than the original asset cost due to the impact of general price level increases over the useful lives of plant and equipment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and commodity prices 
to mitigate such risks  the company enters into various hedging transactions 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined company policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes 
analytical techniques and selective hedging instruments are applied to manage and monitor such market exposures 
foreign currency exposure foreign currency exposures arising from cash flow transactions include firm commitments and anticipatory transactions 
translation exposure is also part of the overall foreign exchange risk 
the company s exposure to foreign currency risks exists primarily with the brazilian real  canadian dollar  mexican peso  japanese yen and major european currencies 
the company regularly enters into foreign currency contracts primarily using foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge most of its firm commitment exposures 
the company also employs foreign exchange forward contracts as well as option contracts to hedge approximately of its anticipated future cash flow transactions over a period of one year 
the notional amount of these contracts at december   was  the company also limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by entering into offsetting asset or liability positions and by establishing and monitoring limits on unmatched positions 
the company s pretax earnings from foreign subsidiaries and affiliates translated into us dollars using a weighted average exchange rate was  for the year ending december  on that basis  the potential loss in the value of the company s pretax earnings from foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would amount to  interest rate exposure in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  the company generally maintains a large portion of its debt as fixed rate in nature by borrowing on a long term basis 
at december   the company had no outstanding short term debt 
the total outstanding long term debt was  at year end  the fair value of the company s long term debt was  in addition  at december   the fair value of securities held for investment was  the fair value of the company s total long term debt and its securities held for investment would not be materially affected by a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
therefore  the effects of interest rates changes in the fair value of the company s financial instruments are limited 
commodities exposure due to the nature of its business  the company procures almost all of its synthetic rubber used in manufacturing tire tread at quarterly fixed rates using contracts with the company s main suppliers 
therefore  the company s exposure to changes in commodity prices is insignificant 
impact of year the company completed all year readiness work by december   and  as a result  experienced no significant problems during  and subsequent to  the change to the new calendar year 
the company does not expect to have any further exposure to the year issue 
the cumulative amount spent related to the year issue totaled  of this total   was recorded as expense in the year incurred and the remaining  which was spent to replace hardware and software and upgrade existing hardware  was capitalized 
the company does not expect to have significant expenditures in the future relating to the year issue 
euro conversion on january   eleven member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legal currencies and one common currency  the euro 
the euro is now trading on currency exchanges and may be used in certain transactions such as electronic payments 
beginning in january  new euro denominated notes and coins will be issued  and legal currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
the conversion to the euro has eliminated currency exchange rate risk for transactions between the member countries  which for the company primarily consists of sales to certain customers and payments to certain suppliers 
the company has addressed the issues involved with the new currency  which include converting information technology systems and recalculating currency risk  and revised its processes for preparing accounting and taxation records
