item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion in this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risk  assumptions  and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
words such as believe  may  could  expects  likely  variations of these words  and similar expressions  are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below in the section entitled factors that may affect future results and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as those discussed in this item and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview during the three year period ended december   the company increased its revenue at a compounded annual growth rate of  as revenue increased to million in  from million in a significant increase in fleet size to meet customer demand as well as an increase in the freight rates contributed to revenue growth over this period 
in addition to internal growth  the company completed seven acquisitions during the three year period ended the acquired operations generated approximately million in combined revenue 
the company intends to continue to grow both internally and through acquisitions  with the main constraint on internal growth being the ability to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of qualified drivers 
over the same three year period  the company increased its net income at a compound rate of approximately to million in  from million in earnings per share diluted increased at a compounded rate of  reflecting the issuance of  company shares in a stock offering 
several factors contributed to the increase  including negotiating higher freight rates from substantially all customers 
although higher driver compensation partially offset the increased freight rates  management believes the company benefited from attracting and retaining more drivers 
the company makes no assurance that its revenue and earnings will continue to grow at the historical rates 
changes in several operating statistics and expense categories are expected to result from actions the company s acquisition of bud meyer  srt  and harold ives 
these operations use predominately single driver tractors  as opposed to the primarily team driver tractor fleet operated by covenant s long haul operation 
the single driver fleets operate fewer miles per tractor and experience more empty miles 
the additional expenses and lower productive miles are offset by generally higher revenue per loaded mile and the reduced employee expense of compensating only one driver 
in addition  the company s refrigerated services must bear additional expenses of fuel for refrigeration units  pallets  and depreciation and interest expense of more expensive trailers associated with temperature controlled service 
the company s operating statistics and expenses are expected to shift in future periods with the mix of single  team  and temperature controlled operations 
the company also initiated the use of owner operators of tractors in the company s contracted with an average of owner operators in and an average of owner operators in owner operators provide a tractor and a driver and bear all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed lease payment per mile 
in addition  the company does not have the capital outlay of purchasing the tractor 
in  the company also financed approximately tractors under operating leases 
in  the company financed tractors and trailers under operating leases 
in  the company financed an additional tractors and trailers under operating leases 
the lease payments to owner operators and the financing of tractors under operating leases appear as operating expenses under revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
expenses associated with owned equipment  such as interest and depreciation  are not incurred  and for owner operator tractors  driver compensation  fuel  communications  and other expenses are not incurred 
because obtaining equipment from owner operators and under operating leases effectively shifts financing expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses  the company intends to evaluate its efficiency using pretax margin and net margin rather than operating ratio 
in march  the company reached an agreement in principle with five other publicly traded truckload carriers to form a transportation brokerage  logistics  and purchasing company called transplace 
com 
upon negotiation and closing of a formal agreement  covenant would contribute approximately million in cash and the intangible assets of its brokerage and logistics business 
in exchange  covenant would receive a ownership interest in transplace 
com 
management currently is unable to fully predict the impact of the proposed transaction 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to revenue for each of the three years ended december revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and related expenses fuel  oil  and road expenses revenue equipment rentals and purchased repairs operating taxes and licenses insurance general supplies and expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue increased million  to million in from million in the revenue increase was primarily generated by a increase in weighted average tractors  to  in  from  in  as the company expanded internally to serve new customers and higher volumes from existing customers  as well as externally through the acquisitions of gouge in august  srt in october  atw in september  and harold ives in november the company s average revenue per loaded mile increased to approximately in  from in the increase was attributable primarily to per mile rate increases negotiated by the company 
the increase in average revenue per loaded mile more than offset an increase in the empty miles percentage 
revenue per total mile increased to approximately in  from in salaries  wages  and related expenses increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  salaries  wages  and related expenses decreased to in  from in driver wages as a percentage of revenue decreased to in  from in  because the company utilized more owner operators and a larger percentage of single driver tractors from the operations of srt  and harold ives  which only have one driver to be compensated 
a driver wage increase that went into effect in october  and an additional increase planned for early are expected to increase driver wages as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
the company experienced an increase in non driving employee payroll expense to of revenue in the period from of revenue in the period due to the start up of covenant transport logistics and the acquisitions of srt and harold ives 
health insurance  employer paid taxes  and workers compensation decreased to of revenue in  from in the decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of improved group health insurance rates in as compared to the rates 
fuel  oil  and road expenses increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  oil  and road expenses decreased to in from in during  average for the year fuel costs increased approximately per gallon versus the increase in was more than offset by fuel surcharges  fuel hedges  and by the increased usage of owner operators who pay for their own fuel purchases 
however  fuel prices rose sharply during the fourth quarter of and remain elevated at levels much higher than the average in or thus  fuel  oil  and road expenses are anticipated to increase as a percentage of revenue in fuel surcharges amounted to nearly 
per mile or approximately million during fuel surcharges were not triggered during the company s percentage of fuel purchases that are hedged was approximately in and is approximately for the year revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to in from in during  the company began using owner operators of revenue equipment  who provide a tractor and driver and cover all of their operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile 
accordingly  expenses such as driver salaries  fuel  repairs  depreciation  and interest normally associated with company owned equipment are consolidated in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation when owner operators are utilized 
the company increased the fleet size of owner operators to an average of in  compared to in  an increase of 
the company also entered into additional operating leases 
during  an average of approximately tractors were leased compared to an average of approximately leased tractors during the equipment leases will increase this expense category in the future  while reducing depreciation and interest 
the company also formed a logistics division in the fourth quarter of that is being reflected in this expense category as well 
repairs increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  repairs decreased to in  from in as a percentage of revenue  repairs decreased due to the increased number of owner operators who are responsible for their own repairs  which more than offset additional repairs associated with a slight increase in fleet age 
operating taxes and licenses increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  operating taxes and licenses decreased to in  from in  due to increased revenue per tractor more efficiently spreading this largely fixed cost

depreciation and amortization  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to in  from in  because the company utilized more owner operators  leased more revenue equipment  and realized an increase in revenue per tractor per week  which more efficiently spread this fixed cost over a larger revenue base 
amortization expense relates to deferred debt costs incurred and covenants not to compete from two  one  and two business acquisitions  as well as goodwill from two  two  and three acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expense is net of any gain or loss on the sale of tractors and trailers 
gain on sale of tractors and trailers was million in  and  in the market for used tractors deteriorated late in  and into if the prices for used equipment remain depressed  the company may recognize less gain or a loss on the sale of its tractors and trailers  which would impact depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue 
interest expense decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  interest expense decreased to in  from in  as the result of utilizing more owner operators  leasing more revenue equipment  and averaging lower debt balances related to the company s secondary stock offering in april as a result of the foregoing  the company s pretax margin remained essentially constant at in  compared with in the company s effective tax rate was in  and in  due to the company paying taxes to a greater number of states 
as a result of the factors described above  net income increased million  to million in of revenue  from million in of revenue

revenue per total mile increased to approximately in  from in salaries  wages  and related expenses increased million  to in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  salaries  wages  and related expenses increased to in from in driver wages as a percentage of revenue decreased to in  from in  primarily because the use of owner operators more than offset a per mile pay increase for employee drivers that went into effect in april non driving employee payroll expense increased to of revenue in from in although the company continued to reduce the number of non driving employees per tractor  a larger number of participants in the company s bonus program contributed to the increase 
health insurance  employer paid taxes  and workers compensation increased to of revenue in  from in the increase as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of a higher state unemployment tax rate in  as compared to the tax rate 
fuel  oil  and road expenses increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  oil  and road expenses decreased to in  from in the increase reflects the greater number of tractors in service in the decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of improving fuel prices during  as well as the increased use of owner operators who pay for their fuel purchases 
the expense for owner operators is reflected in the revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation expense category 
fuel surcharges were not in effect during  and amounted to nearly per mile or approximately million during revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to in  from in during  the company increased its use of owner operators of revenue equipment  who provide a tractor and driver and cover all of their operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile

as a result of the factors described above  net income increased million  to million in of revenue from million in of revenue 
liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business has required significant investments in new revenue equipment 
the company historically has financed its revenue equipment requirements with borrowings under a line of credit  cash flows from operations  long term operating leases  and a small portion with borrowings under installment notes payable to commercial lending institutions and equipment manufacturers 
the company s primary sources of liquidity at december   were funds provided by operations and borrowings under its primary credit agreement  which had maximum available borrowing of million at december  the credit agreement 
the company believes its sources of liquidity are adequate to meet its current and projected needs 
the company s primary sources of cash flow from operations in were net income increased by depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes 
the most significant uses of cash provided by operations were to fund prepaid expenses primarily license plates for revenue equipment and to finance increases in receivables and advances associated with growth in the business 
the company s number of days sales in accounts receivable decreased from days in  to days in net cash provided by operating activities was million in  and million in net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in such amounts were used primarily to acquire additional revenue equipment as the company expanded its operations 
in addition  approximately million represented the purchase price for the assets of atw  of which approximately million was allocated to goodwill  and approximately million represented the purchase price for the acquisition of harold ives  of which approximately million was allocated to goodwill 
the company expects capital expenditures  primarily for revenue equipment net of trade ins and the approximately  square foot addition to the company s headquarters to be approximately million in  exclusive of acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  and million in the primary source of cash for and was provided by borrowings under the credit agreement 
in  funds were also provided by the proceeds from the sale of company shares 
the company sold  shares and certain stockholders of the company sold  shares of class a common stock in a public offering effective april  the company received net proceeds of million in connection with the offering 
the proceeds were used to reduce the company s indebtedness under the revolving line of credit 
the indebtedness was incurred primarily to acquire revenue equipment 
the company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of class a common stock by the selling stockholders 
at december   the company had outstanding debt of million  primarily consisting of million drawn under the credit agreement  million in year senior notes  million in term equipment financing  a million interest bearing note to the former primary stockholder of srt related to the acquisition  and million in notes related to non compete agreements 
interest rates on this debt range to 
the credit agreement is with a group of banks and has a maximum borrowing limit of million 
borrowings related to revenue equipment are limited to the lesser of of net book value of revenue equipment or million 
working capital borrowings are limited to of eligible accounts receivable 
letters of credit are limited to an aggregate commitment of million 
the credit agreement includes a security agreement such that the credit agreement may be collateralized by virtually all assets of the company if a covenant violation occurs 
a commitment fee  that is adjusted quarterly between and per annum based on cash flow coverage  is due on the daily unused portion of the credit agreement 
the company  and all subsidiaries  are parties to the credit agreement and related documents 
the company renewed the credit agreement in june the credit agreement revolves through december   and then has a three year term out if not renewed 
payments for interest are due quarterly in arrears with principal payments due in twelve equal quarterly installments beginning in  if not renewed 
borrowings under the credit agreement are based on the banks base rate or libor and accrue interest based on one  two  or three month libor rates plus an applicable margin that is adjusted quarterly between and based on cash flow coverage 
at december   the margin was 
in october  the company placed million in year senior notes with an insurance company 
the notes bear interest at  payable semi annually  and mature on october  principal payments are due in equal annual installments beginning in the seventh year of the notes 
proceeds of the notes were used to reduce borrowings under the credit agreement 
in december  the company engaged in a sale and leaseback transaction involving of the company s tractors that had been newly acquired or were awaiting delivery 
the proceeds of the sale were used to reduce debt under the credit agreement 
the company entered into a three year lease of the equipment  with a implied interest rate and a residual value guaranteed by the company at a level equal to the company s salvage value on owned tractors 
the company s headquarters facility was completed in december  the cost of the approximately acres and construction of the headquarters and shop buildings was approximately million 
the company financed the land and improvements under a build to suit operating lease 
the company is currently constructing an approximately  square foot addition to the office building and is improving an additional acres of land 
the estimated cost of these activities in is million 
the credit agreement  senior notes  and the headquarters and terminal lease agreement contain certain restrictions and covenants relating to  among other things  dividends  tangible net worth  cash flow  acquisitions and dispositions  and total indebtedness 
all of these instruments are cross defaulted 
the company was in compliance with the agreements at december  inflation and fuel costs most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
fuel expense comprises a larger percentage of revenue for covenant than many other carriers because of covenant s long average length of haul 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  increases usually are not fully recovered 
in the fourth quarter of  fuel prices escalated rapidly and have remained high 
this has increased the company s cost of operating 
seasonality in the trucking industry  revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments during the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather creating more equipment repairs 
first quarter net income historically has been lower than net income in each of the other three quarters of the year because of the weather 
the company s equipment utilization typically improves substantially between may and october of each year because of the trucking industry s seasonal shortage of equipment on traffic originating in california and the company s ability to satisfy some of that requirement 
the seasonal shortage typically occurs between may and august because california produce carriers equipment is fully utilized for produce during those months and does not compete for shipments hauled by the company s dry van operation 
during september and october  business increases as a result of increased retail merchandise shipped in anticipation of the holidays 
the table below sets forth quarterly information reflecting the company s equipment utilization miles per tractor per period during   and the company believes that equipment utilization more accurately demonstrates the seasonality of its business than changes in revenue  which are affected by the timing of deliveries of new revenue equipment 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends 
equipment utilization table miles per tractor per period first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year to date  the company s information and non information systems have experienced no adverse impact from the transition to the year in addition  the company is not aware of any material year related issues with any of its shippers  suppliers  or other third parties with whom it has business relationships 
through december   the company spent approximately  to address year issues 
the company does not expect to incur any significant additional costs relating to year issues 
factors that may affect future results a number of factors over which the company has little or no control may affect the company s future results 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following economic factors 
negative economic factors such as recessions  downturns in customers business cycles  surplus inventories  inflation  and higher interest rates could impair the company s operating results by decreasing equipment utilization or increasing costs of operations 
fuel price 
the price of diesel fuel escalated rapidly in late and early fuel is one of the company s largest operating expense  and high fuel prices have a negative impact on the company s profitability 
continued high fuel prices may affect the company s future results 
resale of used revenue equipment 
the company historically has recognized a gain on the sale of its revenue equipment 
the market for used tractors experienced a sharp drop in late and into if the prices for used equipment remains depressed  the company could find it necessary to dispose of its equipment at lower prices or retain some of its equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers 
competition for drivers is intense in the trucking industry 
there was in  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers 
this shortage could force the company to significantly increase the compensation it pays to driver employees  curtail the company s growth  or experience the adverse effects of tractors without drivers 
competition 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with other truckload carriers  private fleets operated by existing and potential customers  railroads  rail intermodal service  and to some extent with air freight service 
competition is based primarily on service  efficiency  and freight rates 
many competitors offer transportation service at lower rates than the company 
the company s results could suffer if it cannot obtain higher rates than competitors that offer a lower level of service 
regulation 
the trucking industry is subject to various governmental regulations 
the dot is considering a proposal that may limit the hours in service during which a driver may operate a tractor and a proposal that would require installing certain safety equipment on tractors 
although the company is unable to predict the nature of any changes in regulations  the cost of any changes  if implemented  may adversely affect the profitability of the company 
acquisitions 
a significant portion of the company s growth has occurred through acquisitions  and acquisitions are an important component of the company s growth strategy 
management must continue to identify desirable target companies and negotiate  finance  and close acceptable transactions or the company s growth could suffer 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risks from changes in i certain commodity prices and ii certain interest rates on its debt 
commodity price risk prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political  economic  and market factors that are generally outside the company s control 
because the company s operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
historically  the company has been able to recover a portion of short term fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can be as well as the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
for  diesel fuel expenses represented of the company s total operating expenses and of total revenue 
the company uses purchase commitments through suppliers  to reduce a portion of its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
at december   the national average price of diesel fuel as provided by the us department of energy was per gallon 
at december   the notional amount for purchased commitments during was million gallons 
at december   the price of the notional million gallons would have produced approximately million of income to offset increased fuel prices if the price of fuel remained the same as of december  at december   a ten percent change in the price of fuel would increase or decrease the gain on fuel purchase commitments by million 
interest rate risk the credit agreement  provided there has been no default  carries a maximum variable interest rate of libor for the corresponding period plus 
at december   the company had drawn million under the credit agreement  which is subject to variable rates 
considering all debt outstanding  each one percentage point increase or decrease in libor would affect the company s pretax interest expense by  on an annualized basis 
the company does not trade in these derivatives with the objective of earning financial gains on price fluctuations  nor does it trade in these instruments when there are no underlying related exposures
