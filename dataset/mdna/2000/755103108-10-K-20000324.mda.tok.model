new products totaling million were introduced through the automotive original equipment section of the wet friction segment 
the heavy duty market continues to decline as demand slows  with agricultural product sales being exceptionally slow 
the agricultural market declined approximately million as compared to lower farm commodity prices and weaker farm economic conditions have adversely affected retail demand 
these conditions are expected to continue to impact the agricultural equipment market in operating profit declined slightly for the prior year from million in as compared to million in the modest decrease of 
million relates directly to the decrease in overhead spending and material handling offset by an increase in direct labor 
aftermarket segment in millions net sales operating profit aftermarket segment revenues increased to million as compared with million in the increase is a result of marketing efforts on existing product lines  the introduction of new products and improvement in market share 
the growth in sales of transmission filters  friction plates and steel plates provided million of the total in growth year over year 
the expansion of the dry friction clutch plates program provided the remainder of the growth over the aftermarket segment is not expected to grow at the same rate in the year it is anticipated that this segment will grow at a percent rate 
operating profit increased to million as compared to million in the increase is primarily due to increased unit production and the introduction of new products in the aftermarket segment increased operating profit million over on million of increased sales 
this equates to operating profits increasing cents for every new sales dollar 
this strong profitability ratio is due to improved operating efficiencies in the manufacturing and distribution components of this business 
dry friction segment in millions net sales operating profit dry friction segment revenues decreased to million as compared with million in the decrease of million is due to a decline in sales million and an adverse foreign currency fluctuation million  offset by million in revenues from the china facility that became fully operational in increased competition and the slow growth in the european economy are significant factors contributing to the performance 
operating profit increased to million as compared to 
million in the increase is due to the positive results generated from the company s china facility 
this operation completed its first full year of operations and is anticipated to reach full capacity by year end market conditions and outlook the company s wet friction segment expects to continue to face an increasingly competitive automotive environment and a continued slowdown for the demand in certain agricultural machine products 
our major customers in the automotive industry face an increased competitive automotive environment which is likely to continue to limit raytech s pricing flexibility in the near term 
in addition  the weakness of the japanese yen and other asian currencies against the us dollar and the uncertain future of the asian economies could result in substantial increases in imports from asia to the us and canada 
the asian economic difficulties could have an unfavorable effect on overall economic conditions in the us and canada  where our major customers sales are concentrated 
with regard to the company s agricultural equipment operations  worldwide farm commodity prices remain low as a result of prospects for increased global supplies of grains and oilseeds  as well as fears about the asian economic issues 
accordingly  retail demand for agricultural equipment in is now projected to remain at levels in north america  europe and latin america and australia 
in light of this outlook and the company s continuing commitment to aggressive asset management  production schedules are being reviewed for to ensure the company s production meets demand 
the aftermarket segment is expected to remain constant compared to results for the competition in this market continues to increase as mergers continue to occur between suppliers 
the sales growth in this segment has been the result of new product introduction in filters  dry friction clutch facings and planetary gears over the past years 
evaluating new products for this market is a key element in the strategy 
the dry friction segment continues to operate in a sluggish european environment with unemployment remaining at high levels and economic growth improving only marginally 
the development of new market opportunities in asia is supported through the new production facility in china 
the overall asian economy continues to be negatively affected by the weakened economies of japan and other asian countries 
the company s outlook for anticipates modest reduction in sales with improved operating income over results 
increased market share in the automotive original equipment market and the continued introduction of new products for aftermarket distribution are expected to be the drivers for performance 
further  it is anticipated that the dry friction operation in china will improve the performance of this segment 
year update the company did not experience any disruptions to its normal operations as a result of the transition into calendar year thorough testing of mission critical business processes has been performed in order to validate the data integrity of internal and external system interfaces 
the total cost  associated with achieving worldwide year compliance  excluding internal costs  was approximately million 
the costs of the company s year compliance efforts were funded through operating cash flows 
the company will continue to monitor its business processes and third parties for potential problems that could arise in the first few months of calendar year based on the company s preparations prior to january  and the absence of any problems to date  no significant disruptions are anticipated 
euro conversion the company is well advanced in the process of identification  implementation and testing of its systems to adopt the euro currency in its operations affected by this change 
the company s affected suppliers  distribution network and financial institutions have been contacted and the company does not believe the currency change will significantly impact these relationships 
as a result  the company expects to have its systems ready to process the euro conversion during the transition period through january  when the euro will become the official currency of participating nations 
the cost of information systems modifications  effects on product pricing and purchase contracts  and the impact on foreign currency financial instruments are not expected to be material 
financial risks the company maintains lines of credit with united states and foreign banks  as well as other creditors detailed in note f debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is naturally exposed to various interest rate risk and foreign currency risk in its normal course of business 
the company is fortunate to operate in an environment which allows for effective management of its accounts receivable as evidenced by the average days sales in trade receivables of days 
this allows for minimum borrowings in supporting inventory and trade receivable growth due to increased sales 
management does not anticipate a significant change in fiscal policy in any of its borrowing markets in given current economic conditions 
further  the company can reduce the short term impact of interest rate fluctuation through deferral of capital investment should the need arise 
the rates of interest on the various debt agreements range from to 
the company has not entered into any interest rate management programs such as interest rate swaps or other derivative type transactions 
the amount of exposure which could be created by increases in rates is not considered significant by management 
the local currencies of the company s foreign subsidiaries have been designated as the functional currencies 
accordingly  financial statements of foreign operations are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate in effect during the year for revenues and expenses 
where possible  the company attempts to mitigate foreign currency translation effects by borrowing in local currencies to fund operations 
the company does not believe that the fluctuation in foreign currency will have a material adverse effect on the company s overall financial condition 
additionally  the company does not enter into agreements to manage any currency transaction risks due to the immaterial amount of transactions of this type 
liquidity and capital resources the company s wet friction and dry friction operations are capital intensive and the required capital is funded through current operations and external borrowing sources 
the aftermarket operation has historically required less capital investment and has provided needed capital through current operations 
the positive cash flows provided by operations in were the result of continued record performance and totaled million

the ratio of year end assets to net sales was in  compared to percent in the higher ratio reflects higher trade receivables and inventory in support of increased sales 
additionally  property  plant and equipment increased due to the capital investment made in trade accounts receivable result from sales in the normal course of business 
trade receivables increased million during due to increased sales 
the ratios of worldwide net trade accounts receivable to year end net sales were percent in  percent in  and percent in the collection period for trade receivables averages days in and and for and  respectively 
inventories increased by million in inventories are valued on a first in  first out fifo basis 
the increase over reflects additional inventories to support increased sales and improved customer delivery performance 
the ratios of inventories to year end net sales were percent for  percent for and percent for additional information detailing the debt of raytech corporation can be found in note f debt to the financial statements 
future liquidity since the formation of raytech and the restructuring that occurred in  raytech has been named a co defendant in approximately  asbestos related lawsuits as a successor in liability to raymark 
until february  the defense of all such lawsuits was provided to raytech by raymark in accordance with the indemnification agreement included as a condition of the purchase of the wet clutch and brake division and the german subsidiary from raymark in in february  an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against raymark  and subsequently  a restrictive insurance funding order was issued by an illinois court denying defense costs  and another raymark insurance carrier had been declared insolvent 
these circumstances caused raymark to be unable to fund the costs of defense to raytech in the asbestos related lawsuits referenced above 
in an asbestos related personal injury case decided in october in a us district court in oregon  raytech was ruled under oregon equity law to be a successor to raymark s asbestos related liability 
the successor ruling was appealed by raytech and in october  the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court s judgment on the grounds stated in the district court s opinion 
the effect of this decision extends beyond the oregon district due to a third circuit court of appeals decision in a related case cited below wherein raytech was collaterally estopped precluded from relitigating the issue of its successor liability for raymark s asbestos related liabilities  and a petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the us supreme court in october as the result of the inability of raymark to fund raytech s costs of defense recited above and in order to obtain a ruling binding across all jurisdictions as to whether raytech is liable as a successor for asbestos related and other claims  including claims yet to be filed relating to the operations of raymark and its predecessors  on march   raytech filed a petition seeking relief under chapter of title  united states code in the united states bankruptcy court  district of connecticut 
under chapter  substantially all litigation against raytech has been stayed while the debtor corporation and its non filed operating subsidiaries continue to operate their businesses in the ordinary course under the same management and without disruption to employees  customers and suppliers 
in june raytech filed a class action in the bankruptcy court against all present and future asbestos claimants seeking a declaratory judgment that it not be held liable for the asbestos related liabilities of raymark 
it was the intent of raytech to have this case heard in the us district court  and since the authority of the bankruptcy court is referred from the us district court  upon its motion and argument the us district court withdrew its reference of the case to the bankruptcy court and thereby agreed to hear and decide the case 
in september  the us district court issued a ruling dismissing one count of the class action citing as a reason the preclusive effect of the oregon case under the doctrine of collateral estoppel conclusiveness of judgment in a prior action  in which raytech was ruled to be a successor to raymark s asbestos liability under oregon law 
the remaining counts before the us district court involve the transfer of raymark s asbestos related liabilities to raytech on the legal theories of alter ego and fraudulent conveyance 
upon a motion for reconsideration  the us district court affirmed its prior ruling in february also  in february  the us district court transferred the case in its entirety to the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
such transfer was made by the us district court without motion from any party in the interest of the administration of justice as stated by the us district court 
in december  raytech filed a motion to activate the case and to obtain rulings on the remaining counts which was denied by the us district court 
in october  the creditors committee asked the court to certify the previous dismissal of the successor liability count 
in february  the us district court granted the motion to certify and the successor liability dismissal was accordingly appealed 
in may  the third circuit court of appeals ruled that raytech is collaterally estopped precluded from relitigating the issue of its successor liability as ruled in the oregon case recited above  affirming the us district court s ruling of dismissal 
a petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the us supreme court in october the ruling leaves the oregon case  as affirmed by the ninth circuit court of appeals  as the prevailing decision holding raytech to be a successor to raymark s asbestos related liabilities 
in october  raytech reached a tentative settlement with its creditors and entered into a memorandum of understanding with respect to achieving a consensual plan of reorganization the plan 
the parties to the settlement include raytech  the official creditors committee  the guardian ad litem for future claimants  the connecticut department of environmental protection and the us department of justice  environmental and natural resources division 
substantive economic terms of the memorandum of understanding provide for all general unsecured creditors  including but not limited to all asbestos and environmental claimants to receive of the equity in reorganized raytech and any and all refunds of taxes paid or net reductions in taxes owing resulting from the transfer of equity to a trust established under the bankruptcy code  and existing equity holders in raytech to receive of the equity in reorganized raytech 
substantive non economic terms of the memorandum of understanding provide for the parties to jointly work to achieve a consensual plan  to determine an appropriate approach to related pension and employee benefit plans and to cease activities that have generated adverse proceedings in the bankruptcy court 
the parties have also agreed to jointly request a finding in the confirmation order to the effect that while raytech s liabilities appear to exceed the reasonable value of its assets  the allocation of of the equity to existing equity holders is fair and equitable by virtue of the benefit to the estate of resolving complicated issues without further costly and burdensome litigation and the risks attendant therewith and the economic benefits of emerging from bankruptcy without further delay 
pursuant to the memorandum of understanding  a consensual plan of reorganization the plan has been drafted and is being considered by all interested parties to the bankruptcy and upon approval will be submitted to the court as part of the confirmation process 
allowed claims under the plan will fall into five classes  including priority  secured  general unsecured  affiliate and shareholder 
most allowed claims will fall into the general unsecured class and will be paid through the equity contribution  including all asbestos related claims  environmental claims  employee related claims and contractual and general claims 
the confirmation process  which is underway and being considered by the bankruptcy court  includes the approval of the plan  approval of a disclosure statement  an estimation of claims  a vote by creditors and final confirmation by the bankruptcy court 
it is possible that the confirmation will occur in  however  the timing and terms of the final plan cannot be predicted with certainty 
the adverse ruling in the third circuit court of appeals  of which a petition for writ of certiorari was denied by the us supreme court  precluding raytech from relitigating the issue of its successor liability leaves the us district court s oregon ruling as the prevailing decision holding raytech to be a successor to raymark s asbestos related liabilities 
this ruling could have had a material adverse impact on raytech as it did not have the resources needed to fund raymark s potentially substantial uninsured asbestos related and environmental liabilities 
however  the tentative settlement between raytech and its creditors as recited in the memorandum of understanding referenced above has defined the impact of the successor liabilities imposed by the referenced court decisions 
while an outline of principles in the memorandum of understanding has been agreed to by raytech and its creditors  a written consensual plan of reorganization must still be agreed to and is subject to review and confirmation by the bankruptcy court  which at this time cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the memorandum of understanding not result in a confirmed plan  the ultimate liability of the company with respect to asbestos related  environmental  or other claims would remain undetermined 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern  which contemplates continuity of operations  realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the uncertainties regarding the reorganization proceedings raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability  revaluation and classification of recorded asset amounts or adjustments relating to establishment  settlement and classification of liabilities that may be required in connection with reorganizing under the bankruptcy code 
the company has a long term obligation to raymark resulting from the purchase of the wet clutch and brake business and the german subsidiary in at january   the amount owed raymark  including accrued interest  was approximately million

subsequently  in may  the monthly installments were suspended  and the escrow account containing previously paid installments was retracted pending the assets purchased being free of raymark related encumbrances and liabilities 
in february  the principal of the debt owed on the raymark wet clutch and brake note was adjusted to reflect payments  accrued interest and indemnity offsets

the loans bear interest at per annum and are included in the current portion of long term debt 
the debt obligations related to the german subsidiary are denominated in deutsche marks and amount to  at january  as such  the company is at risk to future currency fluctuations with respect to this debt
