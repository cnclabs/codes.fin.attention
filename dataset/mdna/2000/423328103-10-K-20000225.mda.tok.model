market position we concentrate primarily on senior secured lending  with of lending assets and investments at december  being made on that basis 
also  to a more limited extent  we make subordinated loans and invest in select debt and equity instruments 
we believe that  as of december   our subsidiary  factofrance heller factofrance  is the largest factoring operation in france 
we were named the small business administration a lender nationwide based upon volume for the sba s fiscal year 
we are among the largest lenders to private equity sponsored companies in the us middle market 
we believe we are the leading provider of secured finance to small and mid sized healthcare companies 
additionally  we are a recognized leader in real estate finance  vacation ownership lending  vendor finance and middle market equipment finance and leasing in the united states 
we have built our portfolio through effective asset origination capabilities  disciplined underwriting and credit approval processes  effective portfolio management  and acquisitions 
our business groups have the ability to manage asset  client  industry and geographic concentrations and enhance profitability by distributing assets through securitizations  syndications and loan sales 
heller history and recent activities heller was founded in from our inception  we have primarily targeted our commercial financing activities at mid sized and small businesses in the united states 
since  we have also competed in selected international markets through our consolidated subsidiaries and investments in international joint ventures 
heller was purchased by a subsidiary of the fuji bank  limited fuji bank in fuji bank owned of heller s common stock between that time and april in may  we issued  shares of class a common stock in an initial public offering the ipo 
the ipo reduced fuji bank s ownership  through its direct subsidiary fuji america holdings  inc fahi  to of the voting interest and of the economic interest of our issued common stock 
fuji bank s ownership was further reduced to of the voting interest and of the economic interest when we issued approximately million shares of our class a common stock in conjunction with our acquisition of healthcare financial partners  inc hcfp in july as a result of such voting interest  fahi has the unilateral power to elect all of the members of our board of directors 
in may  heller increased its ownership of international group to from by purchasing the interest held by fuji bank 
from the time of fuji bank s purchase of heller through  the substantial majority of our portfolio consisted of corporate finance and real estate finance assets 
since  we have diversified our portfolio 
while continuing to build our corporate finance and real estate finance franchises  we also invested significant resources in building other secured lending businesses through start ups of new business units  acquisitions and the expansion of smaller existing operations 
products include asset based working capital and term financings secured by accounts receivable and inventory and various types of equipment finance and leasing product offerings 
in the past several years  we selectively expanded our overseas operations  most significantly by completing the acquisition  in april  of the interest of our joint venture partner in factofrance  the leading factoring company in france 
we further expanded our leasing operations in by acquiring certain us assets of the dealer products group of dana commercial credit corporation and the stock of the dealer products group s international subsidiaries collectively  dealer products group 
in july  we believe we became the leading financing provider to small and middle market healthcare companies nationally by acquiring hcfp and combining it with our existing healthcare finance activities 
in august  we opened our new canadian subsidiary  heller financial canada  ltd 
which allows us to offer canadian borrowers all of the lending and leasing products we are able to offer our customers in the us in december  we completed the sale of the assets of our commercial services business unit  part of our domestic commercial finance segment 
we believe that long term success in the domestic factoring business would have required substantial economies of scale  which commercial services would not have been able to achieve through internal growth 
we plan on using the capital and other resources made available from this sale to increase our investment in our other business groups that  in our opinion  offer greater opportunities for long term growth and profitability 
as the result of the above activities  we believe that we have built a lending portfolio that is well diversified  has strong asset collateralization and provides us with a consistent and diversified income stream

this was our seventh consecutive year of record earnings

as of december   corporate finance had total lending assets and investments of billion  or of heller s total lending and investments 
of this amount about billion represents cash flow financings  and about million represents asset based financings 
we base our commitment to finance cash flow lending transactions on our assessment of the borrower s ability to generate cash flows to repay the loan 
to do this  we consider  among other factors  the borrower s historical and projected profitability  market position  ability to withstand competitive challenges  and relationships with clients and suppliers 
cash flow based transactions are generally cross collateralized and secured by liens on the borrower s current and fixed assets and capital stock 
asset based lending transactions concentrate on balancing collateral values  cash flow and capital structure 
we protect against deterioration of a borrower s performance by using established advance rates against eligible collateral and cross collateralizing revolving credit facilities and term loans 
we also actively manage credit risk through portfolio diversification by industry and individual client exposure 
we manage the corporate finance portfolio centrally to ensure consistent application of credit policy and efficient documentation and approval of transaction modifications 
corporate finance has an established syndication capability 
this enables us to commit to larger transactions while still managing the ultimate size of our retained position and to generate additional income 
in  we acted as agent for private equity sponsored syndicated transactions 
we believe this level of agented transactions makes us the fifth largest syndicator of such deals in the united states 
in  we syndicated a total of billion in commitments

as of december   our average retained transaction size was approximately million in commitments and million in fundings

new business volume was down from due to an anticipated decline in cmbs volume

net writedowns to average lending assets improved to during versus in excluding a million writedown recorded on cmbs assets in  the ratio of net writedowns to average lending assets was for real estate finance during total revenues of real estate finance decreased during as compared to primarily due to lower securitization income and lower net investment gains 
real estate finance s credit philosophy emphasizes selecting properties that generate stable or increasing income cash flow streams  have strong asset quality and proven sponsorship with defined business plans 
we underwrite the cmbs product according to rating agency guidelines and we make all cmbs loans on a senior secured basis 
vacation ownership s credit philosophy considers the developer s business objectives and capital needs  the competitive position of the resort development  mortgage servicing capabilities  receivable performance and the developer s financial strength and timeshare experience 
our credit philosophy for junior secured financings considers the strength and track record of the property developer  the supply and demand dynamics of the particular market and the competitive strengths of the subject real estate 
these credit strategies have resulted in low levels of nonearning assets for the past three years 
our lending and investment philosophy emphasizes portfolio liquidity  relatively small individual transaction sizes and maintenance of a diverse portfolio in terms of geographic location and property type

in addition to securitizations  we participate of most of our junior participation originations through an arrangement with institutional investors in which they participate  in the aggregate  in of qualified transactions 
transactions originated outside of this arrangement may be syndicated as well based on size or concentration considerations 
the use of syndications has enabled us to reduce our average individual retained position in this portfolio to approximately million

since we expect many of these commitments to remain unused  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements

competition heller s markets are highly fragmented and extremely competitive 
they are characterized by competitive factors that vary by product and geographic region 
our competitors include other commercial finance companies  national and regional banks and thrift institutions  investment banks  leasing companies  investment companies  and manufacturers and vendors 
competition from both traditional competitors and new market entrants has intensified in recent years as the result of an improving economy  growing marketplace liquidity and an increasing recognition of the attractiveness of the commercial finance markets 
also  the growth of the securitization markets has reduced the difficulty of accessing capital for some market participants 
this is further intensifying competition in certain market segments 
we compete primarily on the basis of pricing  terms  structure and service 
our competitors often seek to compete aggressively on the basis of these factors 
we may lose market share to the extent we are unwilling to match our competitors pricing  terms or structure in order to maintain our spreads or to maintain our credit discipline 
to the extent that we match competitors pricing  terms or structure  we may experience decreased spreads and or increased risk of credit losses 
many of our competitors are large companies that have substantial capital  technological and marketing resources 
some of these competitors are larger than heller and may have access to capital at a lower cost than we do 
further  the size and access to capital of certain of our competitors are being enhanced by the recent surge in consolidation activity in the commercial and investment banking industries 
also  our competitors include businesses that are not affiliated with bank holding companies and therefore are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and their subsidiaries 
as a result  such non banking competitors may engage in certain activities in which we are currently prohibited from engaging 
regulation bank holding company act fuji bank is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of and is registered as such with the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
as a result  we are subject to the bank holding company act and are subject to examination by the federal reserve 
in general  the bank holding company act limits the activities in which we may engage to those the federal reserve has generally determined to be so closely related to banking 


as to be a proper incident thereto 
the bank holding company act generally requires the approval of the federal reserve before we may engage in such activities 
to obtain the federal reserve s approval  fuji bank must submit a notice that provides information both about the proposed activity or acquisition and about the financial condition and operations of fuji bank and heller 
the bank holding company act will continue to apply to the company for as long as fuji bank holds or more of any class of our voting stock or otherwise is deemed by the federal reserve to control our management or operations 
our current business activities either constitute permitted activities or have received the federal reserve s express approval 
japanese banking law fuji bank  as a japanese bank  is also required to comply with the japanese banking law 
during  the banking law was amended 
the banking law limits the type of subsidiaries in which a japanese bank may invest to those that conduct eligible businesses 
a subsidiary is defined as an entity in which there is ownership of more than of the voting shares 
eligible businesses generally include banks  securities firms  insurance companies  administrative businesses and financial companies 
establishment of any subsidiary requires the prior approval of the financial supervisory agency  an agency of the prime minister s office 
non eligible business investments are permitted if acquired as collateral  although disposition of such businesses is required within one year 
heller intends to use its best efforts to cooperate with fuji bank in fuji bank s compliance with the new statute  provided that such cooperation would not  in the judgment of heller s management  materially and adversely affect heller s business operations 
we do not believe that our cooperation has had or will have a material adverse effect on our current business operations or on the achievement of our intended business and financial goals 
small business act sba loans that we originate are governed by the small business act and the small business investment act of  as amended  and may be subject to the same regulations by certain states as are other commercial finance operations 
the federal statutes and regulations specify the types of loans and loan amounts which are eligible for the sba s guaranty as well as the servicing requirements imposed on the lender to maintain sba guarantees 
other our operations are subject  in certain instances  to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental authorities 
they may also be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions  which  among other things regulate credit granting activities  establish maximum interest rates  finance charges and other charges  require disclosures to customers  govern secured transactions  and set collection  foreclosure  repossession and claims handling procedures and other trade practices 
although most states do not regulate commercial finance  certain states impose limitations on interest rates and other charges and on certain collection practices and creditor remedies 
they may also require licensing of lenders and financiers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms 
we are also required to comply with certain provisions of the equal credit opportunity act applicable to commercial loans 
additionally  we are subject to regulation in those countries in which we have operations and in most cases have been required to obtain central governmental approval before commencing business 
in the judgment of management  the above and other existing statutes and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business 
however  it is not possible to forecast the nature of future domestic or foreign legislation  regulations  judicial decisions  orders or interpretations nor their impact upon our future business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
employees as of december   heller had  employees 
we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements 
during  heller implemented its employer of choice initiative in an effort to gain recognition by its competitors  clients and employees as an exceptional employer an industry and market leader in attracting  developing and retaining employees 
risk management heller s business activities contain elements of risk 
we consider the principal types of risk across the enterprise to be credit risk  asset liability risk including market risk exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as liquidity risk  and operational risk 
we consider the proper management of risk  across the enterprise  essential to conducting our business and to maintaining profitability 
accordingly  we have designed our risk management systems and procedures to identify and analyze our risks 
we have set appropriate policies and limits to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
credit risk management we manage credit risk through underwriting procedures  centralized approval of individual transactions  and active portfolio and account management 
we have developed underwriting procedures for each business line that enable us to assess a prospective borrower s ability to perform in accordance with established loan terms 
these procedures include analyzing business or property cash flows and collateral values  performing financial sensitivity analyses  and assessing potential exit strategies 
for transactions we originate with the intent of reducing our ultimate retained asset size  we assign a risk rating prior to approval of the underlying transaction that reflects our confidence level  prior to funding  in syndicating the proposed transaction 
each business unit has a senior credit officer who reports directly to our chief credit officer and who reviews and approves financing and restructuring transactions that exceed designated amounts 
larger transactions require approval of our chief credit officer or his deputy or a centralized credit committee comprised of our chairman  chief operating officer  chief credit officer and chief financial officer 
our chief credit officer and  in some cases  our chairman  conducts a quarterly portfolio review of each business group s significant assets 
we manage our portfolio by monitoring transaction sizes as well as diversification according to industry  geographic area  property type  and identity of borrower 
through these practices  management identifies and limits exposure to unfavorable risks and seeks favorable financing opportunities 
we use loan grading systems to monitor the performance of loans by product category and an overall risk classification system to monitor the risk characteristics of the total portfolio 
these systems generally consider debt service coverage  the relationship of the loan to underlying business or collateral value  industry characteristics  principal and interest risk  and credit enhancements such as guarantees  irrevocable letters of credit and recourse provisions 
when an account experiences financial difficulties  professionals who specialize in managing workout situations are brought in to more closely monitor the account and formulate strategies to optimize and accelerate the resolution process 
an independent loan review function performs reviews to validate the loan grading of assets and provides its findings to senior management and to our board s audit committee 
our internal audit department iad  which is independent of operations  performs reviews of credit management and operation processes 
iad also reports its findings to senior management and our board s audit committee 
asset liability management we actively measure and quantify interest rate risk  foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk resulting from normal business operations and derivatives hedging activity 
we use derivatives as an integral part of our asset liability management program 
we use these derivatives to diversify sources of funding  alter interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities  and manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we are not an interest rate swap dealer nor are we a trader in derivatives 
we do not use derivative products for the purpose of generating earnings from changes in market conditions 
before entering into a derivative transaction  we determine that a high correlation exists between the change in value of a hedged item and the value of the derivative 
when we execute each transaction  we designate the derivative to specific assets  pools of assets or liabilities 
after the inception of a hedge transaction  our asset liability managers monitor the effectiveness of derivatives through an ongoing review of the amounts and maturities of assets  liabilities and swap positions 
they report this information to our financial risk management committee the frmc  whose members include our chairman  chief operating officer  chief credit officer  chief financial officer and treasurer 
the frmc determines the direction we will take with respect to our financial risk position and regularly reviews interest rate sensitivity  foreign exchange exposures  funding needs and liquidity 
we regularly report these positions and the related frmc activities to the board of directors and our board s executive committee 
interest rate risk management 
we regularly measure and quantify our sensitivity to changes in interest rates in terms of our two primary risks of potential loss basis risk and mismatch risk 
basis risk is the exposure created from the use of different interest rate indices to re price assets versus liabilities  such as prime based assets funded with commercial paper liabilities 
mismatch risk is the exposure created from the re pricing or maturity characteristics of on and off balance sheet assets versus the re pricing or maturity characteristics of on and off balance sheet liabilities 
we use various sensitivity analysis models to measure our exposure to increases or decreases in interest rates on net income 
we perform these analyses to ensure that our exposure to any significant adverse effect of change in interest rates is limited to that approved by the board of directors and the frmc 
the frmc reviews the results of these models monthly 
assuming our balance sheet and off balance sheet positions were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity at december  and  a hypothetical immediate basis point parallel shift in yield curves would have affected net income by less than and  respectively  over a six month horizon 
additionally  if our balance sheet and off balance sheet positions were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing prime commercial paper exposure existing at december  and  a basis point compression in the existing basis would have altered net income by approximately and over a twelve month horizon 
we believe that the above interest rate sensitivity analyses comply with the sec s quantitative disclosure rules about market risk 
we revised our disclosure alternative for from the tabular format in in an effort to streamline our disclosures and to present more practical information to our readers 
we have provided interest rate sensitivity analyses for for comparative purposes 
certain limitations are inherent in the above income simulation models 
the models assume that changes in interest rates are reflected uniformly across all yield curves 
the models do not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and balance sheet composition or other business developments over the period being measured which could affect net income 
although our models provide an indication of our sensitivity to interest rate changes at a particular point in time  we can give no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcomes simulated 
interest rate swaps are our primary tool for financial risk management 
these instruments enable us to match more closely the interest rate and maturity characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
as such  we use interest rate swaps to change the characteristics of fixed rate debt to that of variable rate debt  alter the characteristics of specific fixed rate asset pools to more closely match the interest rate terms of the underlying financing  and modify the variable rate basis of a liability to more closely match the variable rate basis used for variable rate receivables 
at december   we had over billion in notional amount of interest rate swap and basis swap agreements with commercial banks and investment banking firms 
we also utilize interest rate futures to hedge the interest rate risk of a portion of our receivables portfolio 
at december  we held year interest rate futures contracts with an equivalent notional amount of million 
heller s underlying business activities remain unchanged from and are not expected to substantially change in interest rate risk remains a primary market risk exposure that we will continue to manage 
we may utilize certain other types of instruments  in addition to interest rate swaps and futures  to hedge interest rate risk in foreign exchange risk management 
we invest in and operate commercial finance companies throughout the world 
over the course of time  reported results from our operations and investments in foreign countries may fluctuate in response to exchange rate movements in the us dollar 
while our western european operations and investments represent our largest areas of activity  reported results will be influenced to a lesser extent by the exchange rate movements in the currencies of certain countries in asia and latin america where our subsidiaries and investments are located 
in order to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results  we periodically enter into forward currency exchange contracts  cross currency swap agreements or enter into currency options or currency option combinations 
these financial instruments serve as hedges of our foreign investment in international subsidiaries and joint ventures or effectively hedge the translation of the related foreign currency income 
we held billion in notional amount of forward currency exchange contracts and million in notional amount of cross currency swap agreements at december  included in the cross currency interest rate swap agreements were million used to hedge debt instruments issued in foreign currencies at december  through these contracts  we effectively sell the local currency and buy us dollars 
we also periodically enter into forward contracts to hedge receivables denominated in foreign currencies or purchase foreign currencies in the spot market to settle a foreign currency denominated liability 
heller s exposure to foreign exchange risk has increased somewhat since due to the dealer product s group acquisition  since we now have additional operations in certain foreign countries 
foreign exchange risk remains a primary market risk exposure that we will continue to manage 
we have not altered the way in which we hedge our foreign exchange risk nor do we anticipate any significant changes in our implementation of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  may however  impact our use of certain foreign currency hedging instruments in we use a value at risk var methodology to evaluate the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on net income 
var is a measurement of the potential company wide loss in earnings from adverse market movements over a specified period of time with a selected likelihood of occurrence 
our model measures the aggregate sensitivity to all changes in foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed 
the frmc reviews the results of this model monthly 
we have employed a variance co variance approach to measure var 
this approach seeks to quantify market volatility by using historical changes in foreign currency exchange rates to measure the probability of future changes in foreign exchange rates 
variance covariance also uses correlation statistics to measure how different currencies move in relation to one another 
our var analysis calculates the potential after tax earnings at risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates  within a confidence level  over a twelve month horizon 
based on our analysis using a confidence level  it is expected that as of december  and  foreign exchange rate movements would reduce after tax earnings by less than million and million  respectively  over a twelve month horizon 
the high and low var amounts during the year ended december  ranged from million to  the high and low var amounts during the year ended december  ranged from million to we believe that the above var analyses comply with the sec s quantitative disclosure rules about market risk 
we revised our disclosure alternative for from the tabular format in in an effort to streamline our disclosures and to present more practical information to our readers 
we have provided var analyses for for comparative purposes 
liquidity risk management 
we manage liquidity risk primarily by monitoring the relative maturities of assets and liabilities  borrowing funds through the us and international money and capital markets and bank credit markets  and ensuring the availability of substantial sources of liquidity such as unused committed bank lines 
we use cash to fund asset growth and to meet debt obligations and other commitments on a timely and cost effective basis 
our primary sources of funds are commercial paper borrowings  issuances of medium term notes and other term debt securities  and the syndication  securitization or sale of certain lending assets 
at december   commercial paper and short term borrowings were billion and amounts due on term debt within one year were billion 
if we are unable to access such markets at acceptable terms  we could draw on our bank credit and asset sale facilities and use cash flow from operations and portfolio liquidations to satisfy our liquidity needs 
at december   we had committed available liquidity support through our bank credit and asset sale facilities totaling billion representing  on a consolidated basis  of outstanding commercial paper and short term borrowings 
we believe that such credit lines should provide us with sufficient liquidity under foreseeable conditions 
see also item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for further information concerning our liquidity 
operational risk management operational risk is the risk of potential losses due to business risk  event risk or organizational risk 
we have recently adopted an enterprise risk management erm approach to enhance our measurement  reporting and monitoring of all risks  including operational risk 
erm involves an organizational structure in which each business has an operational risk manager responsible for the identification  measurement  monitoring and reporting of credit  market and operational risk 
these risks are then aggregated and monitored  on a company wide basis  by a separate unit led by the operational risk officer who reports to the audit committee of our board of directors 
portfolio quality the continued strong credit quality of our portfolio in reflected our credit strategies  underwriting  portfolio management and disciplined credit approval processes

we classify receivables as nonearning when we have significant doubt about the ability of the debtor to meet current contractual terms 
this may be evidenced by loan delinquency  reduction of cash flows  deterioration in the loan to value relationship and other relevant considerations

nonearning assets as of december  were of total lending assets  an improvement from as of the prior year and favorable to our targeted range of to 
other nonearning assets consist of transactions for business activities we are no longer pursuing 
allowance for losses 
the allowance for losses of receivables is a general reserve available to absorb losses in the entire portfolio 
we establish this allowance through direct charges to income 
losses are charged to the allowance when we deem all or a portion of a receivable uncollectible 
we review the allowance periodically and we adjust it when appropriate given the size and loss experience of the overall portfolio  the effect of current economic conditions  and the collectibility and workout potential of identified risk and nonearning accounts 
for repossessed assets  if the fair value declines after the time of repossession  we record a writedown to reflect this reduction in value 
our allowance for losses of receivables totaled million  or of receivables  at december  versus million  or of receivables  at december  the decrease as a percentage of receivables is consistent with the strong credit performance of our portfolio 
the ratio of allowance for losses of receivables to nonearning impaired receivables exceeded at december   and delinquent earning accounts and loan modifications 
earning accounts days or greater past due totaled million  or of receivables at december  compared to million or at december  the level of delinquent earning accounts changes between periods based on the timing of payments and the effects of changes in general economic conditions on our borrowers

see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements below 
general we are in the commercial finance business  providing primarily collateralized financing and leasing products and related services to mid sized and small businesses in the united states and selected international markets 
we classify the sources of our operating revenues in two broad categories net interest income  and non interest income 
net interest income represents the total interest income we earn  principally through our financing and leasing activities  less the total interest expense we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  which largely relate to the funding of these financing and leasing activities 
non interest income consists of factoring commissions  income from investments in international joint ventures  and fees and other income 
fees include loan servicing income  late fees  structuring fees  residual rental income  syndication fees  and prepayment fees 
other income includes real estate participation income  our share of income from fund investments  gains from sales  syndications and securitizations of lending assets and investments  and equipment residual gains 
our primary expenses  other than interest expense  are operating expenses  including employee compensation and general and administrative expenses and provisions for credit losses 
in july  we acquired the assets of hcfp for approximately million 
we paid of the purchase price in the form of our class a common stock and in cash 
we issued approximately million shares of class a common stock for the transaction  which reduced the ownership interest in heller of our majority shareholder  fuji bank  from to 
we also issued options to purchase approximately million shares of our class a common stock 
the options were issued at prices ranging from to per share of our class a common stock to replace stock options previously held by hcfp employees for hcfp common stock 
hcfp was a rapidly growing commercial finance company exclusively focused on providing secured financing to small and mid sized health care providers throughout the united states 
the hcfp business  combined with our existing healthcare operations  is operated as a business unit within our domestic commercial finance segment and is known as healthcare finance 
in december  we sold the assets of our commercial services unit  part of our domestic commercial finance segment for approximately million in cash 
the sale consisted of million of factored accounts receivable and the assumption of million of liabilities due to factoring clients 
we recorded an after tax gain on the sale of approximately million  which included adjustments for transaction costs  obligations to employees  termination of third party contracts such as facility leases and vendor contracts  asset impairment charges  recourse provisions and certain other costs directly attributable to the sale 
our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based upon the timing of certain events  such as securitizations and net investment gains 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  results of operations overview 
for the year ended december  net income totaled million compared with million for the prior year  an increase of 
net income applicable to common stock was million compared with million  an increase of 
net income for includes a one time after tax gain of million relating to the sale of the assets of our commercial services business unit 
excluding this gain  net income was for the year  an increase of over the prior year  marking our seventh consecutive year of record net income 
this increase in net income reflects an increase of million in operating revenues  due to growth in both net interest income and non interest income 
the increase in net interest income  as compared to the prior year  is due to both strengthening margins and growth in lending assets and investments 
see operating revenues net interest income 
the increase in non interest income  as compared to the prior year  is due primarily to larger net investment gains and larger fee income and other 
see operating revenues non interest income 
new business lending volume totaled a record billion  an increase of over the prior year 
this increase was the result of our significant investment in building leadership positions in our businesses and in expanding market coverage

accounting developments in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
collectively referred to as sfas no 

this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts to be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
changes in the fair value of the derivative are to be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows gains and losses on derivatives to offset related results on the hedged items in the income statement and requires that a company must document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are assessing the impact of this statement and will adopt it on january  year compliance we experienced no significant system or other year problems at the turn of the millennium or since then to the date of this report  nor has there been any material change in the total costs of remediation 
we do not believe our spending patterns or cost relationships have been materially affected by year remediation expenditures or postponement of other expenses for other information technology projects or for non technology projects 
we also saw no significant change in revenue patterns or borrower requests for funds in late  and so we do not believe that any significant shifting of revenues or income occurred between late and early finally  we have to date experienced no year related difficulty in transacting with third party vendors and suppliers 
in summary  we adopted a phased approach to assessing and  where necessary  remediating or otherwise addressing  year issues 
phases included awareness  assessment  remediation or implementation of contingency solutions  and validation 
we made certain investments in our software applications and systems to ensure that our systems would function properly through and beyond the year including systems that service the dealer products group and hcfp  we have four loan processing systems  three lease processing systems  a factoring system  and systems for general ledger processing  payroll  accounts payable  fixed assets  treasury and other smaller applications 
we also addressed the impact of the year issue on our consolidated international subsidiaries and our international joint venture companies 
as a result of the risk assessment completed with respect to these international companies in  significant remediation activity and additional readiness validation were completed in during the first quarter of  we engaged an independent consultant to conduct site visits and a limited scope review of overall year preparedness activities at certain of our international companies 
in addition to information technology systems  we assessed and monitored potential year impacts on our material vendors and borrowers  as well as year issues relating to environmental factors such as facilities and general utilities 
with respect to borrowers  a year risk assessment was incorporated into our underwriting and portfolio management activities in order to evaluate exposure due to any lack of compliance on the part of borrowers 
finally  we incorporated year contingency planning into our overall business resumption program in consideration of facilities and other environmental factors as well as with respect to mission critical processes 
we incurred approximately million to date of expenses related to the year issue and estimate that we will incur insignificant additional expenses relating to the issue 
we expensed remediation  compliance  maintenance and modification costs as incurred 
we continue to bear some risk related to the year issue  although we believe such risk to be immaterial 
we are not aware of any continuing contingencies  but we could be materially adversely affected if third parties with whom we have material relationships eg  vendors  including those providing outsourced technology services such as mainframe and application support  borrowers and power companies did not or do not appropriately address their own year compliance issues
