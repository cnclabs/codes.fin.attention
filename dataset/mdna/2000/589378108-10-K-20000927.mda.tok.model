overview 
mercury designs  manufactures and markets high performance  real time digital signal processing computer systems that transform sensor generated data into information which can be displayed as images for human interpretation or subjected to additional computer analysis 
these multicomputer systems are heterogeneous and scalable  allowing them to accommodate several microprocessor types and to scale from several to hundreds of microprocessors within a single system 
during the past several years  the majority of the company s revenues have been generated from sales of its products to the defense electronics market  generally for use in intelligence gathering electronic warfare systems 
the company s activities in this area have focused on the proof of concept  development and deployment of advanced military applications in radar  sonar and airborne surveillance 
medical diagnostic imaging is the other primary market currently served by the company 
mercury s computer systems are embedded principally in magnetic resonance imaging mri  and computed tomography ct machines 
the remaining revenues are derived from computer systems used in such commercial applications as baggage scanning  seismic analysis and automatic testing equipment  and  until the sale of the company s shared storage business unit ssbu in january   shared storage products  sanergy r software and related products and services 
mercury uses a direct sales force to sell its computer systems to the defense electronics markets in the us  japan  the united kingdom and france 
defense electronics sales to other countries are achieved through distributors 
the company also uses a direct sales force to sell its computer systems to the us and international medical imaging markets 
the company sells its products to oems  value added re sellers and end users 
over the past three fiscal years  the company has expanded its sales force to support growing revenues and has made significant expenditures to recruit additional technical and professional staff  to invest in information technology and to improve the company s financial  administrative and management infrastructure 
revenues are generated from the sale of hardware and software products  development contracts  services such as maintenance  training  engineering consulting and system integration of mercury software with third party hardware 
revenues from maintenance  training  engineering consulting services and system integration historically have not constituted a material portion of total revenues 
revenue from product sales is recorded upon receipt of customer purchase order or where applicable  a signed contract executed by both parties provided that delivery has occurred  customer acceptance is not uncertain and collectability is deemed probable 
the company accrues anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
service revenue is recognized ratably over applicable contract periods or as the services are performed 
revenue from contracts involving significant product modification or customizations that are eligible for the percentage of completion accounting method are recognized on an efforts expended basis 
changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
cost of revenues includes the cost of materials  component assembly  internal labor and related overhead 
cost of revenues also can include engineering and other technical labor and related overhead incurred in development and engineering consulting contracts 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues gross margin varies from period to period depending upon numerous variables  including the mix of revenues from hardware  software  development and engineering consulting contracts  the mix of revenues among the markets served by the company  the cost of raw materials  the cost of outsourced services and labor  operational efficiencies  actual production volume compared to planned volume  and the mix of applications for which the company s computer systems are sold 
historically  the company s gross margins on service revenues have been lower than on product revenues 
in addition  the company s gross margins from development contract revenues are typically lower than the company s gross margins from standard product revenues 
the company intends to continue to enter into development contracts and anticipates that the gross margins associated with development contract revenues will continue to be lower than its gross margins on standard product revenues 
mercury has made significant investments in research and development in an effort to maintain its technology leadership in digital signal processing 
mercury invested million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  in development activities associated with the company s key technology competencies as well as in activities that are targeted at developing new technologies and products 
the company expects research and development expenses to continue to increase as the company continues to develop products to serve its markets  all of which are subject to rapidly changing technology  frequent product performance improvements and evolving industry standards 
the ability to deliver superior technological performance on a timely and cost effective basis is a critical factor in securing design wins for future generations of defense electronics and medical imaging systems 
significant research and development spending by the company does not ensure that the company s computer systems will be designed into a customer s system 
because future production orders are usually contingent upon securing a design win  the company s operating results may fluctuate due to either obtaining or failing to obtain design wins for significant customer systems 
results of operations 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues 
year ended june  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal vs 
fiscal revenues 
total revenues increased from million during the year ended june  to million during the year ended june  defense electronics revenues increased from million or of total revenues during the year ended june  to million or of total revenues during the year ended june  this increase in revenue was primarily due to the increased unit demand for defense electronics products  largely comprised of advanced military applications in radar  sonar  and airborne surveillance 
medical imaging revenues increased from million or of total revenues during the year ended june  to million or of total revenues during the year ended june  the increase in medical imaging revenues reflects the increase in production volume of products in the ct application 
other revenues increased from million or of total revenues during the year ended june  to million or of total revenues during the year ended june  the increase in other revenues was due primarily to the addition of a new commercial customer  offset in part by the sale of the ssbu in january  cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased from million during the year ended june  to million during the year ended june  cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased from during the year ended june  to during the year ended june  the decrease in costs as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to a decline in component costs and tighter control over manufacturing spending 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million during the year ended june  to million during the year ended june  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were during the year ended june  and during the year ended june  the increase in expense dollars reflects the hiring of additional sales and administrative personnel  increased commissions related to increased revenues  investment in an enterprise resource planning system  as well as the ongoing development of the company s financial  administrative and management infrastructure to support the company s growth 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million during the year ended june  to million during the year ended june  research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were during the year ended june  and during the year ended june  the increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to the hiring of additional software and hardware engineers to develop and enhance the features and functionality of the company s products and an increased level of introduction of new products in response to a high demand for next generation products 
engineering expenses currently are running higher than management s target levels as the company is working on several major development programs to deliver important new technology to its customers 
management believes that higher engineering spending will continue through fiscal the company s future success and ability to make the appropriate engineering investments  will depend to a significant extent on its ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled technical professionals  particularly project managers  engineers and other senior technical personnel 
the company believes that there is a shortage of  and significant competition for  technical development professionals with the skills and experience necessary to perform the services offered by the company 
the company s ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business depends  in large part  on its ability to hire and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards  technologies and client preferences 
the inability to hire additional qualified personnel could impair the company s ability to satisfy its growing client base  requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in retaining current or future employees and therefore able to continue to make the investments in engineering at the projected higher expenditure levels 
furthermore  the company s inability to retain or hire technical personnel may require contracting or outsourcing engineering activities 
this factor could result in higher than planned engineering expenses and therefore  a possible fluctuation in the company s operating results

in september   the company formed agilevision as a joint venture with sarnoff corporation  the developer of color television and a pioneer in the creation of digital television dtv 
agilevision provides broadcasters and cable providers equipment to optimize their dtv investment and develop new broadband media commerce revenue streams  including master control systems that permit broadcasters to perform multiple functions on a single platform that previously would have required the engineering and integration of numerous discrete products and systems 
the company s total contribution to agilevision was million in cash 
during the year ended june   the company recognized million in expenses related to the operation of agilevision 
the company has funded the losses of agilevision to date and as of june  intends to continue to fund this venture 
no expenses were recognized during the year ended june  on january   the company completed the sale of the ssbu to ibm 
payments are structured with an initial payment of million excluding million to be held in escrow and payable on a contingent basis  followed by quarterly contingent payments of million plus interest 
the quarterly payments are contingent upon ibm s continued use of the technology 
if ibm defaults  mercury has the right to recover the assets  including the patent and other intellectual property 
the company used approximately million in investing activities during the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  during the year ended june   the company s investing activities consisted of million for the purchase of marketable securities net of sales  million for investment in agilevision  million for the purchase of land adjacent to its existing headquarters and million for computers  furniture and equipment 
these payments were partially offset by the receipt of million  net of selling costs from sale of a division 
during the year june   the company s investing activities consisted of million for the purchase of an existing office building and construction of an adjacent building  million for computers  furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements  and  for capitalized software 
these cash outflows were partially offset by the net sale of marketable securities of million and a repayment of notes receivable from related parties amounting to the company generated approximately million in cash from financing activities during the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  during the year ended june  the company s financing activities consisted primarily of million in proceeds received upon the issuance of two senior secured financing notes 
these notes are due november in addition  million in cash was generated from the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options 
these cash inflows were partially offset by the payment of debt and capital lease obligations amounting to approximately  during the year ended june   million in cash was generated from the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options and  was used for the payment of capital lease obligations 
management believes that the company s available cash  marketable securities  cash generated from operations  and from the arrangement related to the sale of the ssbu  will be sufficient to provide for the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at lease the next twenty four months 
if the company acquires one or more businesses or products  the company s capital requirements could increase substantially 
in the event of such an acquisition or in the event that unanticipated circumstances arise which significantly increase the company s capital requirements  there can be no assurance that necessary additional capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
year compliance
