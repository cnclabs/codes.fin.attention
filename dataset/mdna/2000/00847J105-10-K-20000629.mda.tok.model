item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated sales fiscal was the th consecutive year of record sales and the th year in the years the company has been public in which sales increased 
net sales for the year ended march   of  million increased percent over sales of the prior year of  million 
both of the company s segments contributed to the increase in sales 
segment sales the company s business is classified into two operating segments computer systems products include mid range computer systems and high end platforms  storage subsystems  software  servers  personal computers  display terminals and networking products 
computer systems accounted for percent of the company s sales in fiscal compared with percent a year ago 
sales of computer systems increased percent in fiscal industrial electronics products are comprised of semiconductors  and interconnect  passive and electromechanical products 
semiconductors are the building blocks of computer chips and include microprocessors  memory devices  programmable logic devices  and analog and digital integrated circuits 
interconnect  passive and electromechanical products are devices that move or use an electrical signal and include capacitors  connectors  resistors  potentiometers  switches and power conditioning equipment 
industrial electronics accounted for percent of sales in fiscal compared with percent a year ago 
the increase in industrial electronics sales of percent in fiscal is primarily attributable to the increased demand for semiconductors from the internet and communications markets 
gross margins gross margin for the consolidated operations decreased to percent for fiscal from percent in the prior year 
the gross margin for computer systems declined to percent of sales in fiscal from percent a year ago 
the decrease is primarily attributable to continued pricing pressures within the market 
the gross margin for industrial electronics increased to percent in fiscal from percent a year ago 
the increase is attributable primarily to the industry s strengthening demand versus supply  positively impacting average selling prices 
management expects overall gross margin pressure to continue in the next fiscal year 
operating efficiencies warehouse  selling and administrative expenses for consolidated operations were percent of sales in fiscal  down from percent of sales in the prior year 
during  the improvements came from operating efficiencies  coupled with the effects of cost controls 
efficiencies were realized through improved employee productivity and working capital management 
sales per employee increased to  from  in  which represents a gain of approximately percent 
accounts receivable remained at days in inventory turnover of times increased from times in the prior year 
the resulting consolidated operating profit of million was up percent from million in consolidated operating profit was percent of sales in compared with percent of sales in  reflecting the operating expense improvement in fiscal operating profit margin for computer systems of percent decreased from percent in fiscal primarily due to pricing pressures 
operating profit margin for industrial electronics increased to percent from percent in fiscal primarily because of the improvement in gross margin due to increased demand in relationship to supply 
other income in fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax gain of million related to the sale and disposal of assets no longer required in the business 
interest expense interest expense was million  net of million capitalized  in fiscal compared with million a year ago 
the increased interest expense is primarily attributable to the additional debt to fund working capital and capital expenditures needed to support the ongoing growth needs of the business 
taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared with percent a year ago 
the tax rate increase was primarily due to the unrecognized tax benefits associated with the current year operating loss of the company s canadian subsidiary 
net income primarily as a result of the factors noted above  the company s net income for fiscal reached a record high of million  an increase of percent  or million  over fiscal income of million 
diluted earnings per share for fiscal increased to from in the previous year 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales fiscal consolidated net sales of  million in creased percent over sales in the prior year of  million 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volume of computer systems resulting from the acquisition of dickens data systems  inc dickens on march  including the sales of dickens with the prior year on a pro forma basis  fiscal sales increased percent compared with fiscal computer systems sales increased percent in fiscal primarily due to added sales resulting from the dickens acquisition discussed above 
this segment accounted for percent of sales in fiscal compared with percent in the prior year 
industrial electronics net sales increased percent in fiscal primarily attributable to the increased sales of the high volume  low margin semiconductor products 
gross margins the fiscal consolidated gross margin of percent decreased from percent in the prior year 
both operating segments experienced declines in gross margin in fiscal as described below 
computer systems gross margin decreased to percent from percent primarily due to the dickens sales earning a lower gross margin compared with the other computer systems sales 
the gross margin for industrial electronics declined to percent in fiscal from percent in the decrease was attributable primarily to the increase in sales of high volume  low margin products and to the industry s excess semiconductor supply versus demand 
operating efficiencies warehouse  selling and administrative consolidated expenses were percent of sales in fiscal and percent in during  gains resulted from improvements due to leveraging expenses on higher sales volume  coupled with the effects of implementing cost controls 
efficiencies were realized through improved employee productivity and inventory turnover 
sales per employee increased to  from  in receivable collections were days in and inventory turnover of times in increased from times in the prior year 
the resulting consolidated operating profit of million was up percent from million in consolidated operating profit was percent of sales in compared with percent of sales in  reflecting the gross margin erosion in fiscal discussed above 
computer systems operating profit as a percent of sales decreased to percent in from percent in  primarily due to the integration of dickens 
industrial electronics operating profit as a percent of sales declined to percent in from percent in primarily due to the gross margin erosion from the excess capacity in the semiconductor industry 
interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increased interest expense is attributable to additional debt incurred to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements necessary to support the ongoing growth needs of the business  as well as the effect of the acquisition of dickens 
taxes the effective tax rate was percent for fiscal compared with percent in fiscal the tax rate decrease was primarily due to the utilization of the operating loss carryforward of the canadian subsidiary and lower effective state tax rates 
net income primarily as a result of the factors noted above  the company reported net income for fiscal of million an increase of million  or percent over fiscal net income of million 
diluted earnings per share for fiscal decreased to from in the previous year 
the average diluted shares outstanding increased to million in fiscal from million the prior year primarily due to the issuance of convertible trust preferred securities a year ago 
risk control the company has assets  liabilities and cash flows in foreign currencies creating foreign exchange risk with the primary foreign currency being the canadian dollar 
systems are in place for continuous measurement and evaluation of foreign exchange exposures so that timely action can be taken when considered desirable 
reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is an integral part of the company s risk management program 
financial instruments in the form of forward exchange contracts are employed as one of the methods to reduce such risk 
at march   one forward exchange contract in the amount of million existed with a maturity of days 
the foreign exchange contracts have had an immaterial impact on the company s results of operations for the fiscal years ended  and the company has entered into several interest rate swap agreements for purposes of serving as a hedge of the company s variable rate credit agreement borrowings 
the effect of the swaps is to establish fixed rates on the variable rate debt and to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
at march   the company had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million 
pursuant to these agreements  the company pays interest at a weighted average fixed rate of percent 
the weighted average libor rates applicable to these agreements were percent at march  the swap agreements have had an immaterial impact on the company s results of operations for the fiscal years ended  and the company is exposed to interest rate risk from the revolving credit facility s various floating rate pricing mechanisms 
this interest rate exposure is managed by the interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on a portion of the debt and the use of multiple maturity dates 
if interest rates were to increase basis points percent from march  rates  and assuming no changes in debt from march  levels  the additional annualized net expense would be approximately million or 
per diluted share 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the derivative financial instruments 
the company limits this exposure by entering into agreements with major financial institutions that meet credit standards established by the company and that are expected to satisfy fully their obligations under the contracts 
the company extends credit based on customers financial conditions  and generally  collateral is not required 
the company obtains credit insurance in certain circumstances to protect its interests 
credit losses are provided for in the financial statements when collections are in doubt 
inflation has had a nominal effect on the company s operations 
new accounting standards in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires all derivatives to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
management is in the process of analyzing and assessing the impact of the adoption of sfas on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
the company must adopt the statement no later than april  in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which summarizes the staff s views regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues and is effective january  for the company 
the company is currently assessing the impact sab will have on the company s results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources current assets including cash increased by million and current liabilities increased by million for the year ended march   resulting in an increase of million of working capital 
increased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared with the same quarter a year ago  and the weighting of sales within the fourth quarter resulted in increased current asset needs 
the increase in current liabilities is primarily attributable to increased inventory funding requirements 
the company s current ratio was at march   and at year end march  the company s revolving credit facility has a total capacity of million  all of which may be borrowed as of march  in accordance with availability requirements which are subject to meeting certain minimum ratios 
as of march   million was borrowed under the facility 
a year ago  such borrowings aggregated million 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal compared with million in this spending reflects ongoing initiatives designed to improve efficiencies through computer enhancement of operating processes as well as expanded facilities 
management estimates that capital expenditures will be in the range of million in fiscal during fiscal  the company made additional investments in world peace industrial co 
ltd  eurodis electron plc and two other investments in the united states totaling million 
these investments further the company s growth strategy by offering access to an extensive distribution network in the asia pacific region  europe and markets within the united states 
subsequent to year end  in may  the company purchased a minority equity interest in magirus ag  a leading european computer systems distributor 
headquartered in stuttgart  magirus employs more than people in germany  austria  france  italy  spain and switzerland 
during fiscal  total interest bearing debt increased by million 
the increase in debt is primarily attributable to funding working capital requirements 
the ratio of interest bearing debt to capitalization was percent at march  compared with percent a year ago 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and amounts available under its credit facility are sufficient to fund its working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
information technology systems the company capitalized approximately million in fiscal and in connection with the acquisition and installation of an enterprise wide information technology it system 
amounts representing approximately million of these expenditures were operational in fiscal and million are planned to become operational in fiscal the balance of million represents work in process components which are not yet operational 
the company is evaluating these components and presently has no reason to believe that they will not become operational 
in addition  management believes there would be no material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company should such components require further modification or replacement 
it is contemplated that implementation for completing the balance of the it system installation will commence in fiscal year the company completed its year remediation efforts and  since the turn of the century  has not experienced any significant problems internally or with suppliers and customers in connection with this event 
nevertheless  there still remain some future dates that could potentially cause computer system problems 
the company continues to monitor these dates and address any necessary remediation but does not anticipate any major impact on its operations 
other events on may   progen technologies  inc progen  one of the company s major customers  filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the central district of the state of california 
on june   progen made a motion  which was granted  to convert its chapter proceeding to a chapter proceeding 
at the time of the bankruptcy filing  progen owed the company approximately million 
the bankruptcy court has appointed a trustee who has proceeded with liquidation of the assets of progen 
the company continues to assert its security interest and rights in the bankruptcy proceedings 
at this time  management believes  due to the company s status in the bankruptcy proceedings  any effects resulting from this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company 
on february   the company experienced a fire at its twinsburg  ohio distribution center 
this event affected approximately percent of the company s inventory but caused no structural damage or major disruption 
the company believes it has adequate insurance coverage to offset any property loss or business impact resulting from the fire 
forward looking information portions of this report contain current management expectations which may constitute forward looking information 
the company s performance may differ materially from that contemplated by such statements for a variety of reasons  including  but not limited to competition  dependence on the computer market  inventory obsolescence and technology changes  dependence on key suppliers  effects of industry consolidation  risks and uncertainties involving acquisitions  instability in world financial markets  downward pressure on gross margins  uneven patterns of inter quarter and intra quarter sales  and management of growth of the business 
competition the company is a distributor in the industrial electronics and computer systems industry  which has been highly competitive in recent years 
the company faces intense competition in two major respects in obtaining sources of supply for the products distributed  and in developing relationships with customers 
in the case of semiconductor and computer systems products  the company competes for customers with other distributors as well as with some of its suppliers 
some of the company s competitors are larger and more established and have greater financial and other resources  which may enable them to compete more effectively 
also  it is possible that an increasing number of suppliers may decide to distribute their products directly to the customer  which will heighten competitive pressures further 
due to continuing competitive pressures  the company s gross margins have declined in recent years  and the company expects continued pressure on gross margins in the foreseeable future 
softening in the computer network and platform market the company distributes many products that are used in the manufacture or configuration of mid range computer systems and high end platforms 
the technology used in these products has changed rapidly over the last several years  resulting in short life cycles for these products 
because the company s customers have been forced to replace systems that have become technologically obsolete in a relatively short period of time  the company has experienced substantial demand for these products that has contributed significantly to its revenue growth 
a slowdown in this market could have a substantial negative effect on the company s revenues and results of operations 
fluctuations in semiconductor supply and demand the semiconductor market historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand associated with technology changes and supply capability occurring from time to time 
at times when product supply has been high relative to demand  prices for those products have declined 
the company has attempted to minimize the effect of these price fluctuations in its distribution arrangements 
the company s gross margins may nevertheless be negatively affected if an excess supply of semiconductors causes a general decline in prices for those products 
if there is a shortage of semiconductor supply  the company s results of operations will depend on how much product it is able to obtain from suppliers to sell and how quickly the company receives shipments of those products 
there can be no assurance that supply and demand fluctuations in the semiconductor market will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and business 
risks related to rapidly changing technology the company s results of operations will depend in part on successful management of the challenges of rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards characteristic of the market for industrial electronics and computer systems products 
these challenges include predicting the nature and timing of technological changes and the direction of evolving industry standards  identifying  obtaining and successfully marketing new products as they emerge  and minimizing the risk of loss due to inventory obsolescence 
some of the company s competitors may be able to market products that have perceived advantages over the products distributed by the company or that render the products distributed by the company obsolete or more difficult to market 
although the company attempts to minimize the effects of inventory obsolescence in its distribution arrangements  the company may have high inventories of unsold product if a new technology renders a product distributed by the company less desirable or obsolete 
in addition  customers may be less willing  for financial or other reasons  to purchase the new products necessary to use new technologies 
dependence on key suppliers during fiscal the company s three largest suppliers accounted for percent of total sales  with compaq including digital equipment corporation  ibm and intel corporation supplying percent  percent and percent  respectively  of the company s sales volume 
although the company believes that its relationships with suppliers are good  there can be no assurance that the company s suppliers will continue to supply products to the company on terms acceptable to the company 
the loss of any of the company s three top suppliers or a combination of other suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
industry consolidation the industrial electronics and computer systems products distribution industry has become increasingly concentrated in recent years as companies have combined or formed strategic alliances 
if this trend continues  new business combinations or strategic alliances may have a competitive advantage if their potentially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources allow them to negotiate relationships with suppliers that are more favorable than the company s relationships with its suppliers 
if such relationships develop  these new business combinations or strategic alliances may be able to offer lower prices that could precipitate an industry wide decline in prices 
this decline would have a negative impact on the company s gross margins  and could cause a decline in the company s revenues and loss of market share 
risks related to growth through acquisitions the company constantly reviews acquisition prospects that would complement its existing business  augment its market coverage or provide opportunities to expand into new markets 
the company s continued growth depends in part on its ability to find suitable acquisition candidates and to consummate strategic acquisitions 
if the consolidation trend in the industry continues  the cost of completing acquisitions could increase significantly 
to fund rising acquisition costs  the company may issue equity securities  which could dilute the holdings of existing equity holders  or incur debt  which could reduce the fixed charge ratio and result in overleveraging 
these actions  and the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations or the price of the company s common shares 
furthermore  acquiring businesses always entails risk and uncertainties 
the company s may not be able to integrate the operations of the acquired businesses successfully  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
leverage at march   the company s borrowings under a million revolving credit facility with national city bank  cleveland  ohio  as agent for itself and a syndicate of other lenders  totaled million 
in addition  the company issued million principal amount of percent senior notes due in august in march and april  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  the pioneer standard financial trust  issued a total of million of percent mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities  which is an equity related security 
the sole assets of the pioneer standard financial trust are million aggregate principal amount of percent series a junior convertible subordinated debentures due march  the company has executed a guarantee providing a full and unconditional guarantee of the trust s obligations under the trust preferred securities 
as a consequence of the company s obligations  a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations must be dedicated to servicing these obligations and will not be available for other purposes 
furthermore  the company s obligations may limit its ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions  and its flexibility to react to changes in the industry and changing business and economic conditions 
the company s ability to satisfy its existing obligations will depend upon its future operating performance  which may be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors described in this prospectus  many of which are beyond its control 
the company currently anticipates that funds from current operations  available credit facilities and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to finance capital spending and working capital needs and to service its obligations as they become due 
if the company experiences difficulty in servicing its obligations  the company may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  restructure or refinance its indebtedness or seek additional equity capital 
there can be no assurance that any of these strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
uneven pattern of quarterly sales in the company s recent experience  a disproportionate percentage of quarterly sales have occurred in the last week or last day of the fiscal quarter 
this uneven sales pattern makes the prediction of revenues  earnings and working capital for each financial period especially difficult  and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition 
the company believes that this pattern of sales has developed as a result of several factors 
one such factor is the recent tendency of customers to delay purchases until the end of a quarter in the hope of receiving more favorable pricing 
another factor is that customers may not be able to determine until close to the end of their fiscal year whether there are available funds in their capital budgets for the purchase of industrial electronics and computer systems products 
although the company is unable to predict whether this uneven sales pattern will continue over the long term  the company anticipates that  for the foreseeable future  the majority of its sales will continue to occur in the final days of the quarter
