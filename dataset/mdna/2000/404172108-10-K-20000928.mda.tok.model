item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s net income is primarily dependent upon the difference or spread between the average yield earned on loans  mortgage backed securities and investments and the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings  as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities 
the interest rate spread is affected by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different times  or on a different basis  than its interest earning assets 
to better insulate itself from such risk  the company has  over the last few years  attempted to increase both numerically and on a percentage basis its holding of consumer and commercial loans 
the company has also decreased its ratio of fixed rate to adjustable rate loans 
the company s net income is also affected by  among other things  gains and losses on sales of foreclosed property  loans  mortgage backed securities and securities available for sale  provisions for losses on loans  service charge fees  subsidiary activities  operating expenses and income taxes

see forward looking statement under management s discussion and analysis found on page of this report for further discussion 
financial condition data at june   the company had total assets of million  an increase of million from the level at june  the increase in assets was due primarily to an increase in loans receivable of million  mortgage backed securities available for sale of million and cash and cash equivalents of million 
the increase in loans receivable  mortgage backed securities available for sale and cash and cash equivalents was funded primarily by an increase in deposits of million and an increase in advances from federal home loan bank fhlb and other borrowings of million from the levels at june  in addition  stockholders equity decreased from million at june  to million at june   primarily due to the purchase of treasury stock of million  the payment of cash dividends of million and the change in net unrealized loss on securities available for sale of  which was partially offset by net income of million 
the increase in loans receivable of million was due primarily to purchases and originations of principal exceeding amortizations and prepayments of principal 
the increase in mortgage backed securities available for sale of million was primarily the result of purchases of million exceeding sales  amortizations and prepayments of principal 
the bank s purchases of mortgage backed securities available for sale were comprised primarily of thirty year  fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
the million increase in deposits was primarily due to an increase in money market accounts of million and an increase in certificates of deposit of million offset by a reduction in saving accounts of million 
these increases were primarily the result of a focused marketing campaign in money market accounts during the fiscal year 
advances from the fhlb and other borrowings increased million for the year ended june  primarily due to the company obtaining new advances in the amount of million which were partially offset by payments of million on advances and other borrowings during the fiscal year 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
average balances  interest rates and yields 
the following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resulting yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin 
the table does not reflect any effect of income taxes 
all average balances are monthly average balances and include the balances of nonaccruing loans 
the yields and costs for the years ended june   and include fees which are considered adjustments to yield

net interest margin is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis of net interest income the following schedule presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it distinguishes between the increases and decreases due to fluctuating outstanding balances that are due to the levels and volatility of interest rates 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume ie  changes in volume multiplied by old rate and ii changes in rate ie  changes in rate multiplied by old volume 
for purposes of this table  changes attributable to both rate and volume  which cannot be segregated  have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

asset quality in accordance with the bank s internal classification of assets policy  management evaluates the loan portfolio on a monthly basis to identify loss potential and determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the following table sets forth the amounts and categories of the bank s nonperforming assets for the periods indicated 
at june  dollars in thousands total nonaccruing loans    total accruing loans delinquent more than days  total foreclosed assets total nonperforming assets    ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming loans include nonaccruing loans and loans delinquent more than days 
total foreclosed assets does not include land held for development 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on real estate secured loans within to days after the payment is due  the bank generally institutes collection procedures by issuing a late notice 
the customer is contacted again when the payment is days past due 
in the case of consumer loans  the borrower is sent a notice when a loan is days past due and is contacted by telephone when a loan is days past due 
in most cases  delinquencies are cured promptly  however  if a loan has been delinquent for more than days  the bank attempts additional written as well as verbal contacts and  if necessary  personal contact with the borrower in order to determine the reason for the delinquency and to effect a cure  and  where appropriate  reviews the condition of the property and the financial circumstances of the borrower 
based upon the results of any such investigation  the bank may i accept a repayment program which under appropriate circumstances could involve an extension in the case of consumer loans for the arrearage from the borrower  ii seek evidence  in the form of a listing contract  of efforts by the borrower to sell the property if the borrower has stated that he is attempting to sell  or iii initiate foreclosure proceedings 
when a loan payment is delinquent for days  the bank generally will initiate foreclosure proceedings unless management is satisfied the credit problem is correctable 
when a loan becomes days delinquent  except for credit card loans  the bank places the loan on a nonaccrual status and  as a result  accrued interest income on the loan is taken out of income 
income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received until  in management s judgment  the borrower s ability to make periodic interest and principal payments is no longer in doubt  in which case the loan is returned to accrual status 
credit card loans remain in accrual status until days  when accrued interest income on the loan is taken out of income 
nonperforming assets decreased from million at june  to million at june   a decrease of  in addition  the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets  which is one indicator of credit risk exposure  decreased from at june  to at june  nonaccruing loans increased to million at june  from million at june   an increase of million 
included in nonaccruing loans at june  were eight loans totaling  secured by one to four family real estate  two loans in the amount of  secured by commercial real estate  four mobile home loans totaling  seven commercial business loans totaling  four agriculture loans totaling  and twenty consumer loans totaling  for the year ended june   gross interest income of  would have been recognized on loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis had such loans been current in accordance with their original terms 
gross interest income of  was recognized as income on loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis 
accruing credit card loans delinquent more than days decreased from million at june  to  at june  a total of million of credit card loans were delinquent days at june  as compared to million at june  net credit card loan charge offs for the year ended june  were million as compared to million for the same period in fiscal using historical stratification data on the current product  management expects credit card loan write offs not to exceed million in the next six months 
of this amount about will be a charge off against allowance for credit card loan losses  of which the company currently maintains an allowance for credit card loan losses equal to of the outstanding credit card loan balance  or about million 
the remaining will be charged against credit card fee income  interest income and credit card fee income in future periods 
based upon lack of performance  the company ceased processing subprime credit card applications in march as of june   the bank had  of foreclosed assets 
the balance of foreclosed assets at june  consisted of  in consumer collateral excluding mobile home loans   in mobile homes and  in single family residences 
at june   the bank had approximately million of other loans of concern that management has determined need to be closely monitored because of possible credit problems of the borrowers or the cash flows of the secured properties 
these loans were considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses 
the allowance for possible loan losses is established based on management s evaluation of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans for which full collectability may not be reasonably assured  considers the estimated fair market value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance 
although the bank s management believes that the june  recorded allowance for loan losses was adequate to provide for potential losses on the related loans  there can be no assurance that the allowance existing at june  will be adequate in the future 
the following table sets forth information with respect to activity in the bank s allowance for loan losses during the periods indicated 
years ended june  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period    total charge offs    total recoveries  net charge offs    additions charged to operations    additions from acquisition balance at end of period    ratio of net charge offs during the period to average loans outstanding during the period ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at end of period ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans at end of period the allowance for loan losses was million at june  as compared to million at june  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at june  and at june  the bank s management has considered nonperforming assets and other assets of concern in establishing the allowance for loan losses 
the bank continues to monitor its allowance for possible loan losses and make future additions or reductions in light of the level of loans in its portfolio and as economic conditions dictate 
the current level of the allowance for loan losses is a result of management s assessment of the risks within the portfolio based on the information revealed in credit reporting processes 
the company utilizes a risk rating system on all commercial business  agricultural  construction and multi family and commercial real estate loans  including purchased loans  that exceed  a monthly credit review is performed on all types of loans to establish the necessary reserve based on the estimated risk within the portfolio 
this assessment of risk takes into account the composition of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience for each loan category  previous loan experience  concentrations of credit  current economic conditions and other factors that in management s judgment deserve recognition 
in regard to credit card loans  the company is providing a reserve of of the loan balance until the credit card portfolio becomes seasoned 
as of june   million of the million allowance for loan losses was reserved for the credit card loan portfolio 
regulators have reviewed the company s methodology for determining allowance requirements on the company s loan portfolio and have made no recommendations for increases in the allowances during the three year period ended june  real estate properties acquired through foreclosure are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less a deduction for disposition costs 
valuations are periodically updated by management and a specific provision for losses on such properties is established by a charge to operations if the carrying values of the properties exceed their estimated net realizable values 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the allowances  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustments and net earnings being significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determinations 
future additions to the bank s allowances result from periodic loan  property and collateral reviews and thus cannot be predicted in advance 
at june   the bank had a total allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans

provision for losses on loans 
the allowance for possible losses on loans is maintained at a level which is considered by management to be adequate to absorb possible loan losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  based on an evaluation of the collectability of loans and prior loan loss experience 
the evaluation takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay 
the allowance for possible loan losses is established through a provision for possible loan losses charged to expense 
during the year ended june   the company recorded a provision for losses on loans of million compared to million for the year ended june   a decrease of million

these increases were partially offset by an increase in noninterest income of million and a reduction in income tax expense of million 
interest income 
interest income decreased  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  this decrease was primarily due to the falling interest rate environment during the first quarter of fiscal the decrease in interest earned on investment securities was primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of investment securities of million

the company anticipates activity in this type of lending to continue in future years subject to market demand except for subprime credit card loans which the company ceased processing applications in march in addition  the company sells the majority of conventional single family residential real estate loan originations into the secondary market 
net interest income is expected to trend upward as a result of this lending activity as interest rate yields are generally higher on these types of loans compared to the yield provided by conventional single family residential real estate loans 
this lending activity is considered to carry a higher level of risk due to the nature of the collateral and the size of the individual loans 
as such  the company anticipates continued increases in its allowance for loan losses

liquidity and capital resources the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  fhlb advances  amortization and prepayments of loan principal including mortgage backed securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of mortgage loans  sales and or maturities of securities  mortgage backed securities  and short term investments 
while scheduled loan payments and maturing securities are relatively predictable  deposit flows and loan prepayments are more influenced by interest rates  general economic conditions  and competition 
the bank attempts to price its deposits to meet its asset liability objectives consistent with local market conditions 
excess balances are invested in overnight funds 
federal regulations have historically required the bank to maintain minimum levels of liquid assets 
the required percentage has varied from time to time based upon economic conditions and savings flows and is currently of net withdrawable savings deposits and current borrowings 
liquid assets for purposes of this ratio include cash  certain time deposits  us government and corporate securities and other obligations generally having remaining maturities of less than five years 
the bank has historically maintained its liquidity ratio at a level in excess of that required by these regulations 
at june   the bank s regulatory liquidity ratio was 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term responsibility of management 
the bank adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of i expected loan demand  ii projected loan sales  iii expected deposit flows  iv yields available on interest bearing deposits  and v the objectives of its asset liability management program 
excess liquidity is invested generally in interest bearing overnight deposits and other short term government and agency obligations 
during fiscal  the bank required funds beyond its ability to generate funds internally 
thus it used its borrowing capacity with the fhlb by obtaining advances  which increased its borrowings with the fhlb by million 
the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments 
at june   the bank had outstanding commitments to originate or purchase loans of million and to sell loans of million 
the bank had no commitments to purchase or sell securities 
although deposits are the bank s primary source of funds  the bank s policy has been to utilize borrowings where the funds can be invested in either loans or securities at a positive rate of return or to use the funds for short term liquidity purposes

savings institutions insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation are required by the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of firrea to meet three regulatory capital requirements 
if a requirement is not met  regulatory authorities may take legal or administrative actions  including restrictions on growth or operations or  in extreme cases  seizure 
institutions not in compliance may apply for an exemption from the requirements and submit a recapitalization plan 
under these capital requirements  at june   the bank met all current capital requirements 
the office of thrift supervision ots has adopted a core capital requirement for savings institutions comparable to the requirement for national banks 
the ots core capital requirement is of total adjusted assets for thrifts that receive the highest supervisory rating for safety and soundness 
the bank had core capital of at june  pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance act fdicia  the federal banking agencies  including the ots  have also proposed regulations authorizing the agencies to require a depository institution to maintain additional total capital to account for concentration of credit risk and the risk of non traditional activities

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the bank s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the bank s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
effect of new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
the effective date of this statement was deferred by sfas no 
to require its application for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  initial application of this statement should be as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal quarter  on that date  hedging relationships must be designated anew and documented pursuant to the provisions of this statement 
earlier application of all of the provisions of this statement is encouraged  but it is permitted only as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter that begins after issuance of this statement 
this statement should not be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
management has evaluated the impact of this statement on the company s consolidated financial statements and believes the impact will not be significant 
year during the four years prior to fiscal year  substantial time and resources were dedicated in preparation for the issues pertaining to calendar year end the potential year end issue with yk proved uneventful 
asset liability and risk management interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the bank  like other thrift institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its interest bearing liabilities with short and medium term maturities mature or reprice more rapidly than its interest earning assets 
the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk 
even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the board of directors  the company does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
as a continuing part of its financial strategy  the bank considers methods of managing this asset liability mismatch consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of net interest income 
in order to properly monitor interest rate risk  the board of directors has created an asset liability committee whose principal responsibilities are to assess the bank s asset liability mix and recommend strategies to the board that will enhance income while managing the bank s vulnerability to changes in interest rates 
in managing market risk and the asset liability mix  the bank has placed its emphasis on developing a portfolio in which  to the extent practicable  assets and liabilities reprice within similar periods 
the effect of this policy will generally be to reduce the bank s one year gap and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
the goal of this policy is to provide a relatively consistent level of net interest income in varying interest rate cycles and to minimize the potential for significant fluctuations from period to period 
one approach used to quantify interest rate risk is the net portfolio value npv analysis 
in essence  this analysis calculates the difference between the present value of the liabilities and the present value of expected cash flows from assets and off balance sheet contracts 
the following table sets forth  at june   an analysis of the company s interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in npv resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve or basis points  measured in basis point increments 
the data in the following tables is based on assumptions utilized by the ots in assessing interest rate risk of thrift institutions and published in selected asset and liability price tables as of june  
even if interest rates change in the designated amounts  there can be no assurance that the company s assets and liabilities would perform as set forth below 
in addition  a change in us treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the treasury yield curve would cause significantly different changes to the npv than indicated below 
estimated increase decrease in npv estimated npv amount change in interest rates amount percent basis points dollars in thousands the following table sets forth the scheduled repricing or maturity of the bank s assets and liabilities which mature or reprice within one year 
in preparing the following table  it has been assumed  consistent with the assumptions used by the ots  that i adjustable rate first mortgage loans will prepay at a rate of per year  ii fixed maturity deposits will not be withdrawn prior to maturity  and iii escrow accounts are assumed to reprice or be withdrawn in the first three month period 
savings accounts and transaction accounts are expected to reprice within the first year 
using these classifications  fixed rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are assumed to prepay annually as follows weighted average interest rate prepayment assumption less than to to to and over the effect of these assumptions is to quantify the dollar amount of items that are interest sensitive and can be repriced within each of the periods specified 
such repricing can occur in one of three ways i the rate of interest to be paid on an asset or liability may adjust periodically on the basis of an index  ii an asset or liability such as a mortgage loan may amortize  permitting reinvestment of cash flows at the then prevailing interest rates  or iii an asset or liability may mature  at which time the proceeds can be reinvested at current market rates 
the following table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the bank s net interest yield because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other pressures beyond the bank s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period  may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes 
the table does not include redeployment of funds from contractual amortization and the possible impact of annual ceilings on adjustable rate loans and securities 
at june   the bank s cumulative one year gap as a percentage of total assets was a negative and its one to three year gap as a percentage of total assets was a negative

in addition  the company s management may make such statements orally to the media  securities analysts  investors or others 
forward looking statements deal with matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts 
these forward looking statements might include one or more of the following projections of income  revenues  earnings per share  dividends  capital expenditures  capital structure or other financial items 
descriptions of plans or objectives of management for future operations  products or services 
forecasts of future economic performance 
descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to such matters 
forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
they often include words such as believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  or words of similar meaning  or future or conditional verbs such as will  would  should  could or may 
the company s future results may differ materially from historical performance  and forward looking statements about the company s expected financial results or other plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
these include but are not limited to possible legislative changes and adverse economic  business and competitive developments such as shrinking interest margins  deposit outflows  reduced demand for financial services and loan products  changes in accounting policies or guidelines  or in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  changes in credit and other risks posed by the company s loan portfolios  technological  computer related or operational difficulties  adverse changes in securities markets  results of litigation  or other significant uncertainties 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made 
the company does not undertake to update forward looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward looking statements are made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management the company s net income is largely dependent on its net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net income 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to change in interest rates  management monitors the company s interest rate risk 
since  management s asset liability committee has met monthly to review the company s interest rate risk position and profitability  and to recommend adjustments for consideration by the board of directors 
management also reviews the bank s securities portfolio  formulates investment strategies  and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions to assure attainment of the board s objectives in the most effective manner 
notwithstanding the company s interest rate risk management activities  the potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net income 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  the board and management attempt to manage the company s interest rate risk while enhancing net interest margins 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the board and management may determine to increase the company s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to increase its net interest margin 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
consistent with the asset liability management philosophy described above  the company has taken several steps to manage its interest rate risk 
first  the company has structured the security portfolio to shorten the lives of its interest earning assets 
the company s recent purchases of mortgage backed securities and securities available for sale have had either short or medium terms to maturity or adjustable interest rates 
at june   the company had securities available for sale of million with contractual maturities of five years or less and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities of million 
mortgage backed securities amortize and experience prepayments of principal  the company has received average cash flows from principal paydowns  maturities  sales and calls of securities of million annually over the past three fiscal years 
the company also controls interest rate risk reduction by emphasizing non certificate depositor accounts 
the board and management believe that such accounts carry a lower cost than certificate accounts  and that a material portion of such accounts may be more resistant to changes in interest rates than are certificate accounts 
at june   the company had million of regular savings accounts  million of money market accounts and million of now and demand accounts  representing of total depositor accounts 
one approach used to quantify interest rate risk is the net portfolio value npv analysis 
in essence  this analysis calculates the difference between the present value of liabilities and the present value of expected cash flows from assets and off balance sheet contracts 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset liability and risk management for further discussion 
the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk 
even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the board of directors  the company does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities
