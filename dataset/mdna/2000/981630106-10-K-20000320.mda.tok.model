while management believes that  based on information currently available  the company s allowance for loan losses is sufficient to cover losses inherent in its loan portfolio at this time  no assurances can be given that the company s level of allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover future loan losses incurred by the company or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions used by management to determine the current level of the allowance for loan losses 
management may in the future increase its level of allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans and non performing loans in the event it increases the level of commercial real estate  multi family  commercial  construction and development or consumer lending as a percentage of its total loan portfolio

liquidity and capital resources liquidity and funding strategies are the responsibility of the company s asset liability management committee alco 
the alco is responsible for establishing liquidity targets and implementing strategies to meet desired goals 
liquidity is measured by the company s ability to raise cash within days at a reasonable cost and with a minimum of loss 
the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities and borrowings from the fhlb boston 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition

the loans are serviced as mortgage backed securities for fannie mae 
in addition to resulting in a decrease in loans receivable and a related increase in mortgage backed securities  the securitization provides a liquidity related benefit to the company in that it adds high quality collateral to the company s balance sheet which can be pledged for borrowings in the secondary market and designates such loans as available for sale so that the company could sell or collateralize such securities

year compliance the company accomplished the objectives established in its year action plan 
all internal software and hardware used in the company s business made it through the transition from to without any abnormalities or inaccurate results 
in addition  the company s critical vendors and suppliers also made the transition successfully 
as evidenced by our quiet and uneventful transition to the new millenium  the interests of our customers were well protected during the entire project 
other critical  future dates previously identified as being potentially vulnerable to the year problem were tested as part of the century rollover testing 
all critical applications thought to be impacted by future dates were evaluated and further testing of various dates conducted as necessary 
any potential problems identified during this testing have been corrected 
our success with century rollover testing gives us confidence that testing of other future critical dates is just as reliable 
we therefore do not anticipate any problems associated with these future dates 
as a side benefit of the year project  the company completed a revision of its business resumption plan 
the new plan was successfully tested and will continue to be updated and tested annually 
the company also established a new contingency back up site and plans to make further improvements to the infrastructure of this site during federal regulators are continuing to monitor the status of the banking industry as it relates to any future date implications 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which  as amended by sfas  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and requires that an entity recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure them at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  an entity may elect to designate a derivative as follows a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair market value of a recognized asset or liability  or of an unrecognized firm commitment that is attributable to a particular risk  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction  or a net investment in a foreign operation 
the statement generally provides for matching the timing of the recognition of the gain or loss on derivatives designated as hedging instruments with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the item being hedged 
depending on the type of hedge  such recognition will be in either net income or other comprehensive income 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value will be recognized in net income in the period of change 
management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement on the consolidated financial statements  but does not anticipate that it will have a material impact 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given the company s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with approved guidelines 
through such management  the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the company monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operating strategies 
the company maintains an alco responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which meets on a quarterly basis and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
besides the risk that rising interest rates could cause the cost of liabilities to rise faster than the yield on assets  the company s interest rate spread and margin could also be negatively affected in a declining interest rate environment if prepayments were to increase and the company were to reinvest such proceeds at a lower rate 
the company s spread and margin would also be negatively impacted if deposit interest rates did not decline commensurate with asset yields in such a declining interest rate environment 
similarly  spreads and margins would contract in a so called flat or inverse yield curve environment  in which traditional spreads between short and long term interest rates were to be compressed or become negative 
in recent years  the company has utilized the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination of shorter term adjustable rate loans  such as home equity loans and lines of credit as well as emphasizing the origination of multi family and commercial real estate loans  emphasizing the origination of retail checking accounts and offering deposit products with a variety of interest rates  preparing and monitoring static gap and asset liability funding matrix reports  and selectively utilizing off balance sheet hedging transactions  such as interest rate swaps  caps and floors 
the company periodically is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments include interest rate swap  cap and floor agreements 
interest rate swap agreements generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal  or notional  amounts 
these transactions are accounted for using the accrual method 
net interest income resulting from the differential between exchanging floating and fixed rate payments is recorded on a current basis 
interest rate cap and floor agreements generally involve the payment of a premium in return for cash receipts if interest rates rise above or fall below a specified interest rate level 
payments are based on a notional principal amount 
swaps are generally negotiated for periods of one to five years 
caps and floors generally are not readily available for time periods longer than five years 
the company s stated objective regarding the utilization of interest rate swaps  caps and floors is to reduce risk associated with adverse rate volatility while enabling the company to benefit from favorable interest rate movements 
the company s policies provide that a rate swap is in essence a cross hedge and may only be undertaken if the potential correlation of the swap is reasonable 
the company s policies also provide that the costs of caps and floors must be analyzed as they pertain to the spread  asset yield or liability cost being protected 
such costs must be viewed in light of the company s overall profitability 
the company s policies further provide that swap arrangements and the purchase of caps and floors shall only be negotiated with firms which meet the company s investment criteria 
all counter parties to swap  cap and floor arrangements must be pre approved by the company s board of directors 
at december   the notional principal amounts of the company s outstanding interest rate cap and floor agreements were million each 
under the terms of the cap agreements  which were entered into during  the company paid premiums totaling  which is included in other assets and being amortized over three years which are the terms of the agreements 
amortization for the year ended december  totaled  and is recorded as an interest expense on advances 
the agreements provide that  if the london interbank offered rate libor increases above  the company receives cash payments on a quarterly basis 
there were no cash payments for the year ended december  under the terms of the floor agreement  the company paid a premium of  during which is included in other assets and is being amortized over five years which is the term of the agreement 
amortization for the year ended december  totaled  and is recorded as an interest expense on advances 
the agreement provides that if libor falls below  the company receives cash payments on a quarterly basis 
cash payments received during the year ended december  totaled  and was recorded as a credit to interest on advances 
at december   the company was not a party to any swap arrangements 
gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
at december   the company s one year gap position  the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year  was negative 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a negative gap position would be in a worse position to invest in higher yielding assets which  consequently  may result in the cost of its interest bearing liabilities increasing at a rate faster than its yield on interest earning assets than if it had a positive gap 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a negative gap would tend to have its interest bearing liabilities repricing downward at a faster rate than its interest earning assets as compared to an institution with a positive gap which  consequently  may tend to positively affect the growth of its net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown the gap table 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a one year period and subsequent selected time intervals 
for loans on residential properties  adjustable rate loans  and fixed rate loans  actual repricing and maturity dates were used 
mortgage backed securities were assumed to prepay at rates between and annually 
the stratification of savings deposits including now  savings and money market accounts is based on management s philosophy of repricing core deposits in response to changes in the general interest rate environment 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on the company s estimated gap 
while the company believes such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment activity

interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between net interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
fair value of securities  including mortgage backed securities  is based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair value is based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments 
fair value of loans is  depending on the type of loan  based on carrying values or estimates based on discounted cash flow analyses 
fair value of deposit liabilities are either based on carrying amounts or estimates based on a discounted cash flow calculation 
fair values for fhlb advances are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis that applies interest rates concurrently being offered on advances of aggregated expected monthly maturities on fhlb advances 
shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the gap table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  some assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  if interest rates changed  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  it would become more difficult for borrowers to repay their adjustable rate loans if interest rates increased
