the remainder of the decrease was related to profit sharing 
the insurance management fee contract contains a provision to share in the profits of the managed insurance exchange

liquidity and capital resources net working capital was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the current year is due primarily to payments for purchases of property and equipment 
historically  the company has maintained a strong working capital position and  using that base  has been able to satisfy its operational and capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from its operating and investing activities 
these same sources of funds have also allowed the company to pursue investment and expansion opportunities consistent with its growth plans 
in  the company supplemented these traditional sources of funds with short term bank borrowings 
although it is uncertain that operating activities will provide positive cash flow in the year  the company has sufficient borrowing capacity as well as ample liquidity in its holdings of prime medical shares to meet its working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in  the company entered into a three year  revolving credit agreement with nationsbank of texas  na subsequently acquired by bank of america  na funds advanced under the agreement bear interest at the prime rate less  such interest to be payable quarterly 
the company will pledge shares of prime medical to the bank as funds are advanced under the line

capital expenditures for equipment were   and  in   and  respectively 
capital expenditures were higher in due to purchases necessary to reach compliance with year computer issues as well as to higher expenditures for improved office space and leasing fees 
the company expects capital expenditures in to be significantly less than the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  or to pay the interest on  or to refinance  its indebtedness  or to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on its future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control 
based upon the current level of operations and anticipated revenue growth  management believes that cash flow from operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under its bank line of credit  will be adequate to meet the company s future liquidity needs for at least the next several years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that anticipated revenue growth and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available under the line of credit in an amount sufficient to enable the company to service its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs 
inflation the operations of the company are not significantly affected by inflation because  having no manufacturing operations  the company is not required to make large investments in fixed assets 
however  the rate of inflation will affect certain of the company s expenses  such as employee compensation and benefits

no start up costs were incurred by the company or its affiliate during the company does not have any significant capitalized start up costs that would be required to be expensed in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has some exposure to cash flow and fair value risk from changes in interest rates  which may affect its financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
the company does not use financial instruments for speculative purposes  but does maintain a trading account inventory to facilitate the business of its broker dealer subsidiary 
at the end of the inventory balance was  historically  the company has turned this inventory rapidly and has neither significant realized gains nor losses 
the company has notes receivable  in the form of lines of credit to related companies  which are at fixed rates ranging from to 
their fair value will increase and decrease inversely with interest rates 
the company has debt totaling  most of which was drawn on a  revolving line of credit with a floating interest rate 
for each million that the company should borrow in  a increase in interest rate would result in a  annual increase in interest expense
