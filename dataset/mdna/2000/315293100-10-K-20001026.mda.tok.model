item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations for ferrellgas partners and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
forward looking statements statements included in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements 
these statements include whether or not ferrellgas  lp will have sufficient funds to meet its obligations and to enable it to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient funds to permit ferrellgas partners to meet its obligations with respect to the  of senior notes issued by ferrellgas partners in april  and to pay the required distribution on its senior common units  and to pay the minimum quarterly distribution of per common unit 
the forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements 
the risks and uncertainties and their effect on the partnership s operations include but are not limited to the following o the effect of weather conditions on demand for propane  o price and availability of propane supplies  o price and inventory risk of propane supplies  o the effect of increasing volatility in commodity prices on the partnership s liquidity  o the timing of collection of accounts receivable  o the availability of capacity to transport propane to market areas  o competition from other energy sources and within the propane industry  o operating risks incidental to transporting  storing  and distributing propane  o changes in interest rates  o governmental legislation and regulations  o energy efficiency and technology trends  o the condition of the capital markets in the united states  o the political and economic stability of the oil producing nations  o the expectation that the senior common units will be redeemed in the future with proceeds from an offering of equity at a price satisfactory to the partnership  and o expected savings from the integration of the thermogas acquisition  reductions made in personnel and assets related to the existing ferrellgas  lp locations and savings related to the routing and scheduling improvements  all discussed in business recent initiatives 
selected quarterly financial data due to the seasonality of the retail propane business  first and fourth quarter revenues  gross profit and net earnings are consistently less than the comparable second and third quarter results 
other factors affecting the results of operations include competitive conditions  demand for product  timing of acquisitions  variations in the weather and fluctuations in propane prices 
on december   the partnership purchased thermogas llc from williams natural gas liquids  inc  a subsidiary of the williams companies  inc 
thus the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal year will vary significantly from those same quarters in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  the partnership was able to identify the effect of the thermogas acquisition on the results of operations  because the thermogas operations acquired were being operated separately from the existing partnership operations 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the partnership began to implement its strategic and operating plans for the integration of thermogas into the partnership s existing operations 
these integration actions resulted in the merging of retail locations and the related customer groups 
due to the extent of this integration  the partnership is unable to quantify separately the effect of the thermogas acquisition in the discussion of results of operations in the third quarter of fiscal and future quarters 
during fiscal  the wholesale cost of propane increased significantly compared to fiscal the wholesale market price at one of the major supply points  mt 
belvieu  texas  ranged from a per gallon monthly average low of to a high of in fiscal in fiscal  the per gallon monthly average low and high price for the same supply point was and  respectively 
other major supply points in the united states experienced similar increases 
this significant cost increase together with the thermogas acquisition were the major factors causing the increase in the partnership s revenues  accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and cost of goods sold in each quarter of fiscal as compared to fiscal the following presents the partnership s selected quarterly financial data for the two years ended july  fiscal year ended july  in thousands  except per unit data first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter revenues     gross profit     net earnings loss     net earnings loss per limited partner unit basic and diluted fiscal year ended july  in thousands  except per unit data first quarter second third quarter fourth quarter quarter revenues     gross profit     earnings loss before extraordinary loss     earnings loss before extraordinary loss per limited partners unit basic and diluted net earnings loss     the net earnings loss for the first quarter of fiscal year ended july   reflects a  extraordinary loss on early retirement of debt  net of minority interest of results of operations fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july  total revenues 
total gas liquids and related product sales increased to  in fiscal as compared to  for fiscal  primarily due to the addition of thermogas sales and increased sales price per gallon 
the fiscal winter was reported as the warmest winter in recorded history 
for the year  temperatures were warmer than normal and warmer than last year as reported by the american gas association 
sales price per gallon increased due to the effect of the significant increase in the wholesale cost of propane as compared to fiscal retail volumes increased to  gallons in fiscal as compared to  gallons for fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of thermogas and partially offset by the effect of warmer weather 
other revenues increased by  primarily due to favorable results from risk management operations and increased other retail sales 
other retail sales  which includes  among others  tank rental  service labor  appliance and material sales  increased primarily due to the acquisition effect of thermogas 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to  in fiscal as compared to  during fiscal  primarily due to gross profit generated from the acquired thermogas operations and  to a lesser extent  increased favorable results from the risk management operations  partially offset by lower retail margins 
fiscal s retail margins benefited significantly from a low wholesale cost environment 
that cost environment was not repeated during fiscal in addition  while the wholesale cost of propane rapidly increased during the year  the retail sales price lagged the cost increase which caused retail margins to decrease 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to  in fiscal as compared to  for fiscal primarily due to personnel  plant and office  vehicle and other operating expenses incurred due to the acquired thermogas operations 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal to  as compared to  for fiscal primarily due to the addition of intangibles and property  plant and equipment from the thermogas acquisition 
equipment lease expense 
vehicle  tank and computer lease expense increased by  in fiscal due primarily to the addition of operating tank leases  and to a lesser extent to increased operating leases related to new vehicles and computers acquired for retail locations 
see note h to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding the operating tank leases 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal this increase is primarily the result of increased borrowings related to the thermogas acquisition and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the overall average interest rate paid by the partnership 
as a result of the thermogas acquisition  ferrellgas  lp assumed  in debt and also refinanced a portion of its existing revolving credit facility balances 
on february   ferrellgas  lp issued  of fixed rate senior notes which have maturities ranging from to and an average interest rate of in order to repay the  in assumed debt 
the additional  in borrowings was used to fund debt issuance costs 
fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july  total revenues 
total gas liquids and related product sales decreased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in sales price per gallon as a result of the lower wholesale cost of propane experienced in fiscal  the effects of warmer weather and a decrease in revenues from wholesale propane marketing  partially offset by the effect of acquisitions of propane businesses 
the winter of fiscal was reported as the third warmest winter in recorded history 
for the year  temperatures were warmer than normal and warmer than the same period in as reported by the american gas association 
a generally lower wholesale product cost environment experienced during fiscal caused a significant decrease in the sales price per gallon as compared to fiscal retail volumes increased by or  gallons  primarily due to acquisitions 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal retail operations results increased primarily due to increased retail margins and an increase in volumes attributed to acquisitions  partially offset by decreased volumes attributed to warmer weather 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal fiscal s operating expenses increased due to acquisition related increases in personnel costs  plant and office expenses  vehicle and other expenses and also due to performance and merit compensation increases 
equipment lease expense 
vehicle and tank lease expense increased by  in fiscal due to the utilization of operating lease financing to fund fleet upgrades and replacements 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased in fiscal as compared to the fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in the overall average interest rate paid by the partnership on its borrowings as a result of the refinancing of fixed rate debt and existing revolving credit facility balances  partially offset by the effect of increased borrowings for acquisition and growth capital expenditures see liquidity and capital resources financing activities following 
extraordinary item 
during fiscal year  the partnership recognized an extraordinary loss of  net of a minority interest of  the gross extraordinary loss included a payment of a premium and a write off of unamortized financing costs of  resulting primarily from the early extinguishment of  of its fixed rate senior notes 
liquidity and capital resources the ability of the partnership to satisfy its obligations is dependent upon future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
due to the seasonality of the partnership s retail propane business  a significant portion of the partnership s cash flow from operations is typically generated during the winter heating season and the partnership s corresponding second and third fiscal quarters 
during the non peak season and the partnership s first and fourth fiscal quarters  it is not unusual for the partnership to generate negative cash flow from operations due to lower retail sales and fixed expenses impact during the non peak season 
as experienced in previous fiscal years  the next fiscal quarter ending october   is expected to generate negative cash flows from operations  and is typically the time period when the partnership utilizes other sources of funds to meet its obligations 
subject to meeting certain financial tests discussed below  ferrellgas  inc believes that ferrellgas  lp will have sufficient funds available to meet its obligations  to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient funds to permit ferrellgas partners to meet its obligations with respect to the  senior secured notes issued in april and to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient funds to distribute the minimum quarterly distribution on all common units for the fiscal quarter ending october the partnership s credit facilities  public debt  private debt  accounts receivable securitization facility and operating tank leases contain several financial tests and covenants which restrict the partnership s ability to pay distributions  incur debt and engage in certain other business transactions 
in general  these tests are based on the partnership s debt to cash flow ratio and cash flow to interest expense ratio 
ferrellgas  inc believes that the most restrictive of these tests currently are debt incurrence limitations within the credit facility  tank leases and accounts receivable securitization facility and limitations on the payment of distributions within the ferrellgas partners senior secured notes 
the credit facility  tank leases and accounts receivable securitization facility limit ferrellgas  lp s ability to incur debt if ferrellgas  lp exceeds prescribed ratios of either debt to cash flow or cash flow to interest expense 
the ferrellgas partners senior secured notes restrict payments if a minimum ratio of cash flow to interest expense is not met 
this restriction places limitations on the partnership s ability to make certain restricted payments such as the payment of cash distributions to unitholders 
the cash flow used to determine these financial tests generally is based upon the partnership s most recent cash flow performance giving pro forma effect for acquisitions and divestitures made during the test period 
the partnership s financial performance during the  and fiscal years has been adversely impacted by average temperatures that were reported by the national oceanic atmospheric administration as the warmest in recorded history 
in addition  during fiscal  the partnership has experienced high product costs which has negatively impacted retail margins 
despite these challenges  the partnership has continued to meet all of its financial tests and covenants 
these include the debt incurrence tests within the credit facility  tank leases and accounts receivable securitization facility and the ferrellgas partners senior secured notes restricted payment test  as well as other financial tests and covenants in the ferrellgas partners senior secured notes  the million senior notes  the million senior notes  the credit facility  the tank leases and the accounts receivable securitization facility 
based upon current estimates of the partnership s cash flow  ferrellgas  inc believes that the partnership will be able to meet all of the required financial tests and covenants for the fiscal quarter ending october  however  due to the lower than expected operating results experienced during fiscal  if the partnership were to encounter additional unexpected downturns in business operations  such as significantly warmer than normal weather or a volatile cost environment  the partnership may not meet certain financial tests during immediate future quarters 
these factors could temporarily restrict the ability of ferrellgas  lp to incur debt or ferrellgas partner s ability to make cash distributions to its common unitholders 
depending on the circumstances  the partnership could consider alternatives to permit the incurrence of debt at ferrellgas  lp or the continued payment by ferrellgas partners of the quarterly cash distribution to its common unitholders 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives can or will be implemented with respect to any given quarter 
future maintenance and working capital needs of the partnership are expected to be provided by cash generated from future operations  existing cash balances  the credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility 
to fund expansive capital projects and future acquisitions  ferrellgas  lp may borrow on the existing credit facility  ferrellgas partners or ferrellgas  lp may issue additional debt to the extent permitted under existing debt agreements or ferrellgas partners may issue additional equity securities  including  among others  common units 
toward this purpose  on february   ferrellgas partners filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the periodic sale of up to  in debt and or equity securities 
the registered securities would be available for sale by the partnership in the future to fund acquisitions  reductions in indebtedness or for general corporate purposes 
ferrellgas partners also maintains an additional shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for  common units 
these common units may be issued by ferrellgas partners in connection with the partnership s acquisition of other businesses  properties or securities in business combination transactions 
on august   the subordination period ended and all subordinated units converted to common units 
this conversion is more fully described in note f of the consolidated financial statements provided herein 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was  for the twelve months ended july   compared to  for fiscal this decrease in cash provided from operations is primarily due to the higher working capital requirements resulting from the increased costs of propane during fiscal investing activities 
during the twelve months ended july   before the effect of the thermogas acquisition  the partnership made total acquisition capital expenditures of  this amount was funded by  of cash payments   of noncompete notes   of common units issued and  of other costs and consideration 
on december   the partnership purchased thermogas from a subsidiary of the williams companies 
at closing the partnership entered into the following noncash transactions o issued  in senior common units to the seller  o assumed a  bridge loan  which was refinanced from the proceeds of the  senior notes issued on february   and o assumed a  operating tank lease 
as a result of the transaction  the partnership acquired  of cash which remained on the thermogas balance sheet 
since the closing of the acquisition  the partnership has paid  in additional costs and fees related to the transaction between december  and july  the partnership reimbursed the williams companies  as final settlement of its working capital reimbursement obligation 
the partnership has accrued  in exit costs  which it expects to incur within twelve months from the acquisition date as it implements the integration of the thermogas operations 
this accrual included  of termination benefits and  of costs to exit thermogas activities 
exit costs are generally those costs incurred to terminate employees pursuant to an acquisition and to exit an activity of an acquired company 
as of july   the partnership has paid  for termination benefits and  for exit costs 
the partnership does not have any material commitments of funds for capital expenditures other than to support the current level of operations 
in fiscal  the partnership does not expect a significant increase in growth and maintenance capital expenditures resulting from the thermogas acquisition as compared to fiscal levels 
during the twelve months ended july   the partnership made growth and maintenance capital expenditures of  consisting primarily of the following o additions to partnership owned customer storage tanks and cylinders  o relocating and upgrading district plant facilities  o upgrading computer equipment and software  and o vehicle lease buyouts 
the partnership s capital requirements for repair and maintenance of property  plant and equipment are relatively low due to limited technological change and long useful lives of propane tanks and cylinders 
the partnership leases light and medium duty trucks  tractors and trailers 
the partnership believes vehicle leasing is a cost effective method for meeting its transportation equipment needs 
the partnership plans to purchase vehicles at the end of their lease term totaling  in   in and  in the partnership intends to renew other vehicle leases that would have had buyouts of  in   in   in   in and  in historically  the partnership has been successful in renewing vehicle leases subject to buyouts 
however  there is no assurance that it will be successful in the future 
the partnership continues to seek to expand its operations through strategic acquisitions of smaller retail propane operations located throughout the united states 
these acquisitions will be funded through internal cash flow  external borrowings or the issuance of additional partnership interests 
financing activities 
on august   ferrellgas  lp issued the privately placed unsecured million senior notes and entered into a credit facility with its existing banks 
the senior notes include five series with maturities ranging from year through at an average fixed interest rate of 
the proceeds of the senior notes were used to redeem  of ferrellgas  lp fixed rate senior notes issued in july  including a call premium  and to repay outstanding indebtedness under the former ferrellgas  lp revolving credit facility 
on december   ferrellgas  lp terminated its additional credit facility agreement that it had entered into on april  this facility had provided for an unsecured facility for acquisitions  capital expenditures  and general corporate purposes 
the outstanding additional credit facility before its termination on december  was  on december   ferrellgas  lp entered into a  operating tank lease involving the sale leaseback of a portion of its customer tanks with banc of america leasing capital  llc 
this operating lease has a term that expires june  and may be extended for two additional one year periods at the option of ferrellgas  lp  if such extension is approved by the lessor 
on december   immediately prior to the closing of the thermogas acquisition  thermogas entered into a  operating tank lease involving a portion of its customer tanks  with banc of america leasing capital  llc 
in connection with the acquisition of thermogas  ferrellgas  lp assumed all obligations under the  operating tank lease  which have terms and conditions similar to the december    operating tank lease discussed above 
the partnership intends to renew both leases for the two additional one year periods  subject to lessor approval 
following the renewal periods  the partnership intends to refinance these leases  however  there can be no assurance that the partnership will be successful in obtaining this refinancing or lessor approval for the renewals 
on february   ferrellgas  lp issued million of privately placed unsecured senior notes 
the proceeds of the million senior notes  which include three series with maturities ranging from year through and an average fixed interest rate of  were used to retire  of ferrellgas  lp bridge loan financing assumed in connection with the thermogas acquisition 
on april   ferrellgas  lp completed the syndication of both the  and  operating tank lease to a group of banks and other financial institutions 
on april   ferrellgas  lp entered into an amended and restated credit facility 
this  credit facility  which expires on june   replaces the previous  credit facility 
ferrellgas  lp s credit facility consists of a  unsecured working capital  general corporate and acquisition facility  including a letter of credit facility  and a  revolving working capital facility 
this  facility is subject to an annual reduction in outstanding balances to zero for thirty consecutive days 
all borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at the borrower s option  at a rate equal to either london interbank offered rate plus an applicable margin varying from percent to percent or the bank s base rate plus an applicable margin varying from percent to percent 
the bank s base rate at july  and was and  respectively 
to offset the variable rate characteristic of the credit facility  ferrellgas  lp entered into a interest rate collar agreement  expiring january  with a major bank limiting the floating rate portion of london interbank offered rate based loan interest rates on a notional amount of  to between and 
during the year ended july   the partnership repaid  to its credit facility as it related to the funding of working capital  business acquisitions and capital expenditure needs 
effective april   ferrellgas partners entered into an interest rate swap agreement with bank of america  related to the semi annual interest payment due on the  fixed rate senior secured notes due the swap agreement  which expires june   requires bank of america to pay the stated fixed interest rate annual rate pursuant to the  senior secured notes  equaling  every six months due on each june and december in exchange  the partnership is required to make quarterly floating interest rate payments on the th of march  june  september and december based on an annual interest rate equal to the month london interbank offered rate interest rate plus applied to the same notional amount of effective june   ferrellgas  lp entered into an interest rate cap agreement with bank of america  related to variable quarterly rent payments due pursuant to two operating tank lease agreements 
the variable quarterly rent payments are determined based upon a floating london interbank offered rate based interest rate 
the cap agreement  which expires june   requires bank of america to pay ferrellgas  lp  at the end of each march  june  september and december  the excess  if any  of the applicable month floating london interbank offered rate interest rate over a cap of  applied to the unamortized amount outstanding each quarter under the two operating tank lease agreements 
the total obligation under these two operating tank lease agreements as of july  was  on september   ferrellgas  lp received  in cash in exchange for the sale and contribution of a  interest in a pool of its trade accounts receivable to its recently created wholly owned  special purpose subsidiary  ferrellgas receivables 
ferrellgas receivables then sold the interest to a commercial paper conduit of banc one  na according to the terms of a day agreement 
the level of funding available from this agreement is limited to  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  this transaction will be reflected on the partnership s financial statements as a sale of accounts receivable and contribution of capital in the first quarter of fiscal the proceeds of these sales are less than the face amount of accounts receivable sold by an amount that approximates the purchaser s financing cost of issuing its own commercial paper backed by these accounts receivable 
this loss on the september  transaction will be approximately  in the first quarter of fiscal and represents the difference between the fair market value and the book value of the receivables contributed and sold 
at september    of borrowings and  of letters of credit were outstanding under the ferrellgas  lp credit facility 
these borrowings currently carry interest rates ranging from to 
at september   ferrellgas  lp had  available for general corporate  acquisition and working capital purposes under the credit facility and the accounts receivable facility 
based on the pricing grid contained in the credit facility  the current borrowing rate for future borrowings under the credit facility is london interbank offered rate plus 
the partnership believes that during fiscal these facilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs 
however  if the partnership were to experience an unexpected significant increase in working capital requirements  it could cause the partnership to exceed its immediately available resources 
events that could cause increases in working capital requirements include a significant increase in the cost of propane compared to current levels  a significant delay in the collections of accounts receivable or increased volatility in commodity prices related to risk management activities 
the partnership would consider alternatives to provide increased working capital 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives can or will be implemented 
although the williams companies has the right to convert any outstanding senior common units into common units at a premium on february  or upon the occurrence of a material event  the partnership intends to redeem the senior common units at par value prior to the date of conversion 
no assurances can be given that the partnership will be successful in securing the financing to redeem the senior common units 
on august   the partnership declared an in kind distribution of per senior common unit payable by the issuance of additional senior common units and a cash distribution of per common unit  that was paid on september  see notes c and f in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding the in kind distributions to the senior common unitholders

management will implement this bulletin in the first quarter of fiscal and believes that it will have no material affect on the partnership s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the partnership s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices 
additionally  the partnership seeks to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure on variable rate debt and operating leases by interest rate collar and cap agreements 
at july   the partnership had  in variable rate debt and  notional amount of interest rate collar agreements outstanding  after considering the effect of the swap transaction 
the variable rate debt increased in fiscal by  due to the swap transaction 
at july   the partnership had  outstanding in variable rate operating leases and  notional amount of interest rate collar agreements outstanding to mitigate the related variable rate exposure 
both the operating leases and interest rate collar agreements were entered into in fiscal thus  assuming a basis point increase in the variable interest rate to the partnership during fiscal  the interest rate risk related to the variable rate debt  the operating tank leases  the swap transaction and the associated interest rate collar and cap agreements would be an increase of  the partnership s risk management activities utilize certain types of energy commodity forward contracts and swaps traded on the over the counter financial markets and futures traded on the new york mercantile exchange to anticipate market movements  manage and hedge its exposure to the volatility of floating commodity prices and to protect its inventory positions 
the partnership also utilizes certain over the counter energy commodity options to limit overall price risk and to hedge its exposure to inventory price movements 
market risks associated with energy commodities are monitored daily by senior management for compliance with the partnership s risk management trading policy 
this policy includes specific dollar exposure limits  limits on the term of various contracts and volume limits for various energy commodities 
the partnership also utilizes loss limits and daily review of open positions to manage exposures to changing market prices 
market  credit and liquidity risk 
new york mercantile exchange traded futures are guaranteed by the new york mercantile exchange and have nominal credit risk 
the partnership is exposed to credit risk associated with futures  swaps and option transactions in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
for each counterparty  the partnership analyzes its financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establishes credit limits and monitors the appropriateness of each limit 
the change in market value of exchange traded futures contracts requires daily cash settlement in margin accounts with brokers 
forwards and most other over the counter instruments are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term 
the partnership attempts to balance favorable and unfavorable positions with counterparties in order to minimize the risk of collateral requirements for over the counter instruments 
sensitivity analysis 
the partnership has prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk of its energy commodity positions 
forward contracts  futures  swaps and options were analyzed assuming a hypothetical change in forward prices for the delivery month for all energy commodities 
the potential loss in future earnings from these positions from a adverse movement in market prices of the underlying energy commodities is estimated at  as of july  the preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in prices may or may not equal  thus  actual results may differ
