as a result of the large number of transactions not collected by its japanese subsidiary  which resulted in a significant restatement of quarterly revenue in  the company currently believes that it is not appropriate for its japanese subsidiary to recognize future revenues prior to the collection of cash

these side arrangements were not disclosed by certain employees of the company s japanese subsidiary to the financial institutions upon the sale of the receivables

financial risk management foreign exchange risk as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
historically  the company s primary exposures have related to nondollar denominated sales and expenses in europe  asia pacific  including japan and australia  and latin america

we strongly urge current and prospective investors to carefully consider the cautionary statements and risks contained in this report 
stock price volatility sybase s ability to exceed  or its failure to achieve  expected operating results for any period could significantly impact the company s stock price 
inevitably  some investors will experience gains while others will experience losses depending on the timing of their investment 
the market for the company s stock is highly volatile  and the trading price of the company s common stock has fluctuated widely during the past years 
the stock price may continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors  including the company s financial results  press and industry analyst reports  market acceptance of our products and pricing policies  activities of competitors  and other events 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have categorically affected the market price for high technology companies  but which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
revenue related factors the timing and amount of sybase s revenues are subject to a number of factors that make it difficult to accurately estimate revenues and operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
in the company s experience  license fees revenues tend to decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the next year 
this has contributed to lower total revenues and earnings in the first quarter compared to the prior fourth quarter 
we currently anticipate that this seasonal pattern will continue 
since the company operates with little or no backlog  quarterly revenues depend largely on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  the company has recorded to of its quarterly revenues in the last month of each quarter  particularly during the final two weeks of that month 
the company s customers include many large enterprises that make substantial investments in our products and services 
therefore  the inability to record one or more large orders from a customer at the very end of a quarter could materially and adversely impact our results or operations 
the company s operating expenses are based on projected annual and quarterly revenue levels  and are generally incurred ratably throughout each quarter 
since our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  failure to realize projected revenues for a specified period could impact operating results  causing an operating loss for that period  as occurred in the first quarter of in north america  sybase currently ships most of its products from its california and massachusetts distribution facilities 
because we tend to record a high percentage of revenues during the last two weeks of each quarter  disruption of operations at either facility at that time due to natural calamity or systems failure  for example could directly harm the company s ability to record revenues for such quarter 
this could  in turn  have an adverse impact on operating results 
competition the market for the company s products and services is fast paced and extremely competitive  and is marked by dynamic customer demands  short product life cycles  and the rapid emergence of the internet marketplace 
sybase has numerous competitors  including large companies such as oracle corporation  microsoft corporation  and ibm corporation  and smaller highly aggressive internet firms 
many of these companies may have greater financial  technical  sales  and marketing resources  and a larger installed base than sybase 
in addition  our competitors advertising and marketing efforts could adversely influence customer perception of our products and services  and harm our business and prospects as a result 
to remain competitive  sybase must be able to develop new products  enhance existing products and retain competitive pricing policies in a timely manner 
the company s failure to compete successfully with new or existing competitors could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  and on the market price of the company s common stock 
product development increasing widespread use of the internet may significantly alter how the company does business in the future 
this  in turn  could affect our ability to timely meet the demand for new or enhanced products and services at competitive prices 
during and  sybase created certain integrated product sets intended to offer customers more complete packaged solutions 
as a result  certain individual products incorporated into the product sets were no longer available for sale separately 
such integration is intended to address customer needs in a more comprehensive way and improve company revenues and profitability 
however  the elimination of certain products for individual sale could adversely affect license fees and service revenues if this change is not well received in the marketplace 
sybase s future results may also be affected if its products cannot interoperate and perform well with software products of other companies 
certain leading applications currently are not interoperable with sybase products  and others may never be 
in addition  many of sybase s principal products are designed for use with products offered by competitors 
in the future  vendors of non sybase products may become less willing to provide the company with access to their products  technical information  and marketing and sales support  which could harm the company s business and prospects 
divisional sales model in january  the company realigned its direct sales force  product teams and professional services capabilities into four divisions 
this reorganization was intended to enhance overall company revenues and profitability by providing increased focus on each of four key markets enterprise solutions  mobile and embedded computing  internet applications and business intelligence 
if the company has misjudged the demand for its products and services in these markets  or if the divisions are unable to coordinate their respective sales efforts in a focused and efficient way  the change could materially and adversely affect sybase s business and prospects 
international operations sybase derives a substantial portion of its revenues from its international operations 
in  these revenues represented of the company s total revenues 
as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
for a discussion of risks associated with currency fluctuation  see financial risk management foreign exchange risk above  incorporated here by reference 
the company s revenues from international operations could also fluctuate due to the relative immaturity of some markets  rapid growth in other markets  and organizational changes made by sybase to accommodate these conditions
