item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company focusing on the application of genomics to the systematic discovery of genes  gene sequences  variations in gene sequences  biological pathways and drug candidates in order to accelerate the discovery and development of the therapeutic  agricultural and diagnostic products to improve human and animal health and the vitality of agriculture 
we were incorporated in november and  until march  were engaged primarily in organizational activities  research and development of our technology  grant preparation and obtaining financing 
we have incurred losses since inception  principally as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
we anticipate incurring additional losses over at least the next several years as we expand our collaborative gene discovery efforts and internal discovery and development to discover genes  biological pathways and drug candidates  continue development of our technology and expand our operations 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
on february   we completed an offering for  of convertible subordinated debentures due and received net proceeds of approximately  in addition  on february   the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase an additional  of convertible subordinated debentures due  providing us with additional net proceeds of approximately  the debentures may be resold by the initial purchasers to qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act and to non us persons outside the united states under regulation s under the securities act 
the debentures are convertible into our common stock 
in addition  prior to february   if our common stock price reaches specified levels  we have the right to redeem the debentures at a premium by converting the debentures into common stock 
if the price of our common stock reaches for of consecutive trading days prior to february   we may redeem all of the debentures by converting them into common stock 
if we were to convert the debentures prior to february   in addition to the interest accrued and unpaid  we would make an interest make whole payment equal to the present value of the aggregate amount of the interest that would otherwise have accrued from the provisional redemption date through february  we have agreed to file a registration statement with the sec for the resale of any shares issued as a result of the conversion of the debentures 
we are required to file the registration statement by may we anticipate that collaborations will continue to be an important element of our future revenues 
we do not expect that government grant revenues  which were a significant source of our revenues through  will in future years be significant  either in actual dollar amounts or as a percentage of revenues 
therefore  the loss of revenues from existing collaborations would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to generate revenue growth and become profitable is dependent  in part  on our ability to enter into additional collaborative arrangements  and on our ability and the ability of our collaborative partners to successfully commercialize products incorporating  or based on  our technologies which are our solutions to enable discovery of drug products and to predict the efficacy and safety of drug products 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain or expand existing collaborations  or enter into future collaborations to develop applications of our seqcalling  genecalling or pathcalling technologies on terms satisfactory to us  if at all  and  if entered into  we cannot guarantee that any such collaborative arrangements will be successful 
our failure to successfully develop and market additional products over the next several years  or to realize existing product revenues  would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
royalties or other revenue generated for us from commercial sales of products developed by using our technologies are not expected for at least several years  if at all 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
our revenue for the year ended december  was  representing an increase of  or  compared to our revenue of  in this increase was largely due to an increase in collaboration revenue recorded under our arrangements with glaxo  roche pharma  roche vitamins  and cor 
the increase was offset by a decrease in grant revenue due to the completion of all of our federal grants during the calendar year 
as a result of the completion of such federal grants  we foresee no additional grant revenue in future periods  unless additional grant awards are received 
the revenue we recognized under our collaborative arrangements is generally based upon work performed on behalf of collaborators by our employees  or based upon our attainment of certain benchmarks specified in the related agreements 
we expect that collaboration revenues will continue to increase as we add additional collaborations 
operating expenses 
grant research expenses for the year ended december  were  representing a decrease of  or  compared to  in the decrease in grant research expenses was attributable to the completion of our federal grants during the first and second quarters of as a result of the completion of such federal grants  we foresee no additional grant research expenses in future periods  unless additional grant awards are received 
collaborative research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  representing an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in such expenses was primarily attributable to our obligations to fulfill research requirements under new and existing collaborations  in addition to internal research efforts  which resulted in increased purchases of laboratory supplies  increased equipment depreciation and facilities expenses  and additional personnel costs 
we expect our future collaborative research and development expenses to increase as we hire additional personnel and expand our research and development facilities in support of our collaborations and internal research 
during the fourth quarter of  we undertook an upgrade of scientific technologies and related lab equipment and signed an agreement with comdisco  inc comdisco for the acquisition of certain lab equipment with a fair market value of approximately  as a part of this transaction  we also purchased other lab equipment recorded as a capital lease for approximately  from transamerica business credit corporation tbcc 
the comdisco agreement calls for the exchange of the tbcc equipment for the comdisco equipment 
as a result of the exchange of the tbcc equipment for the comdisco equipment  we recognized an asset impairment expense of approximately  in the fourth quarter of see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources section 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased  or  to  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the expansion of administration facilities  increasing payroll costs and the incurrence of related depreciation expense and legal expenses in support of developing our intellectual property portfolios 
over the next several years  we anticipate that the percentage increases in general and administrative expenses will be proportionate to percentage increases in collaborative research and development expenses 
interest income  net 
net interest income for the year ended december  of  decreased  or  compared to  for the decrease was primarily due to the lower balances held in our cash and cash equivalent accounts  and the additional interest expense we paid on capital lease obligations 
we anticipate that net interest income will increase in the future  due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of funds received from the completion of our convertible debt offering  our recent private placements with pequot partners fund  lp and pequot international fund  inc collectively pequot and abgenix  and from the drawdown and simultaneous conversion of loans from biogen and genentech  offset by the interest expense associated with the completion of our convertible debt offering and the expected increase in capital lease obligations 
gross interest expense for the year ended december  of  represented an increase of  or  compared to  for this increase in gross interest expense was primarily attributable to additional capital lease obligations for equipment entered into during the last twelve months  which enabled us to support our research and development activities 
net loss attributable to common stockholders 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  or per share as compared to  or per share in since inception  we have incurred operating losses  and as of december  had an accumulated deficit of  and therefore  have not paid any federal income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  valuation allowances in amounts equal to the deferred income tax assets have been established to reflect these uncertainties in all periods presented 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  was  representing an increase of  or  compared to  in this increase was largely due to an increase in collaboration revenue due to additional revenue recorded under our arrangements with pioneer hi bred and biogen  offset by a decrease in revenue received from genentech under the evaluation agreement 
see note of notes to financial statements 
in april  pioneer hi bred doubled its annual collaboration funding to us to a minimum of  the increase in total revenue was also due to additional grant revenue recorded as a result of timing issues in connection with grant expenses incurred 
operating expenses 
grant research expenses for the year ended december  were  representing a decrease of  or  compared to  in the decrease in grant research expenses was primarily attributable to the completion of two federal grants during the first quarter of  thereby decreasing the costs incurred by us in support of these grants 
collaborative research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  representing an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in collaborative research and development expenses was primarily attributable to increased expenses as we hired additional research and development personnel  increased purchases of laboratory supplies  increased equipment depreciation and increased facilities expenses in connection with the expansion of our collaborative research efforts and our internal discovery and development programs 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased  or  to  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the expansion of administration facilities  the incurrence of related depreciation expense  payment of legal fees  compensation related expenses in connection with a separation agreement  amortization of stock based compensation and hiring of additional personnel to support our future growth

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  compared to  as of december  this increase was primarily a result of our receipt of combined net proceeds of approximately  from our private placements with pequot and abgenix  and from the drawdown and simultaneous conversion of loans from biogen and genentech  offset by operating losses in support of our research and development activities 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through our initial public offering  revenues received under our collaborative research and development arrangements  private placements of equity securities  government grants  and capital leases 
as of december   we had recognized  of cumulative sponsored research revenues from collaborative research agreements and government grants 
to date  inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
in september  we completed a private placement of  shares of unregistered common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  to pequot 
in october  we exercised our right under existing collaborative agreements with biogen and genentech to borrow an aggregate of  to support on going operating activities 
simultaneously with these drawdowns  we converted the loan from biogen into  shares of our common stock  and converted the loan from genentech into  shares of our non voting common stock 
on november   we filed a registration statement registering the resale of the  shares of common stock issued to biogen and the  shares of common stock that are issuable upon the conversion of the  shares of non voting common stock issued to genentech 
the registration of such shares is required under the collaborative agreements with biogen and genentech

accordingly  on november   we signed an agreement with comdisco  for the acquisition of certain lab equipment with a fair market value of approximately  as a part of this transaction  we also purchased other lab equipment recorded as a capital lease for approximately  from tbcc 
the comdisco agreement calls for the exchange of the tbcc equipment for the comdisco equipment 
as a result of the exchange of the tbcc equipment for the comdisco equipment  we recognized an asset impairment expense of approximately  in the fourth quarter of in order to properly reflect our estimate of the fair market value of the retired lab equipment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the newly acquired comdisco equipment will be treated as a capital lease in the amount of  on february   we completed an offering for  of convertible subordinated debentures due and received net proceeds of approximately  in addition  on february   the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase an additional  of convertible subordinated debentures due  providing us with additional net proceeds of approximately  the debentures may be resold by the initial purchasers to qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act and to non us persons outside the united states under regulation s under the securities act

we are required to file the registration statement by may on march   we announced a two for one split on both our voting common stock and our non voting common stock  each payable to our stockholders in the form of a stock dividend 
on march   our stockholders of record will receive one additional share of our voting common stock for every share of voting common stock and one additional share of non voting common stock for every share of non voting common stock each stockholder owns at the close of business on march  our investing activities have consisted primarily of acquisitions of equipment and expenditures for leasehold improvements 
at december   our gross investment in equipment  computers and leasehold improvements since inception was  at december   equipment with a gross book value of  secures our equipment financing facility 
we anticipate that net proceeds of approximately  from our available lease line will be utilized for capital expenditures over the next several years  primarily for the purchase of additional equipment and improvements at our laboratories 
we had approximately  in material commitments for capital expenditures at december  in accordance with our investment policy  we are utilizing the following investment objectives for cash and cash equivalents investment decisions are made with the expectation of minimum risk of principal loss  even with a modest penalty in yield  appropriate cash balances and related short term funds are maintained for immediate liquidity needs  and appropriate liquidity is available for medium term cash needs  and maximum after tax yield is achieved 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  can be attributed to an increase in our net loss and accrued expenses  primarily offset by decreases in accounts payable  accrued bonuses  deferred revenue  and the asset impairment charge as well as depreciation and amortization costs 
as of december   we had federal and connecticut net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately  and  respectively 
federal net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in  and connecticut net operating loss carryforwards began expiring in we also had federal and connecticut research and development tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately  and  respectively at december  year compliance the year problem arose because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these computer programs may recognize a year ending in as the year rather than the year  which could result in a significant disruption of operations and an inability to process certain transactions 
early in  we assessed our internal computer systems and our non information technology systems and determined that  because our computer applications use four digits to identify a year in the field date  we were internally compliant with year requirements 
with respect to material non information technology systems  we determined that substantially all of these systems were provided by third parties 
we developed a strategic plan to estimate the potential risks related to third parties with which we have significant relationships and concluded that year issues would not materially affect the continuation of our normal daily operations 
to date  our operations have suffered no significant disruption from year problems 
we incurred no material historical costs relating to year compliance  and we have not incurred any material costs in resolving the year problems of third parties with whom we interact 
we intend  however  to continue monitoring our internal computer systems and those of third parties for year problems 
year problems that are as yet undiscovered may arise in the future and could have a significant impact on our operations
