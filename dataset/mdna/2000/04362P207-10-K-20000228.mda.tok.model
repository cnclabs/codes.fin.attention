results of operations the following table and discussion compares the results of operations for the years ended december   and years ended december  percent of net revenues net revenues licenses services total net revenues cost and expenses cost of software distribution cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative write off of goodwill and long term assets write off of acquired research and development merger and restructuring charges total expenses operating income loss net income loss our operating results for improved over the prior year due to revenue growth of while costs and expenses increased by only when compared to growth in consolidated revenues was experienced by all regions during fiscal as sales increased by   and in latin america  north america  europe and asia pacific  respectively 
as a percentage of net revenues  all operating expense categories for either decreased or remained consistent when compared to as we continued our effort to keep operating expenses in line with revenues 
revenue growth combined with lower operating costs resulted in an increase of million  or  in operating income to million for from million in revenues we derive revenues from licensing software and providing post license technical product support and updates to customers and from consulting and training services 
license revenues 
license revenues may involve the shipment of product by us or the granting of a license to a customer to manufacture products 
our products are sold directly to end user customers or through resellers  including oems  distributors and value added resellers var s 
license revenues for increased to million from million in the higher license revenue growth rate experienced in was due to continued demand for our established products and the introduction and market positioning of new products and versions including our red brick and cloudscape product offerings 
each of our regions reported increased license revenues for fiscal when compared to fiscal  as follows europe  middle east and africa emea license revenues increased to million as compared to million  an increase of north america license revenues increased to million as compared to million  an increase of latin america license revenues increased to million as compared to million  an increase of asia pacific license revenues increased to million as compared to million  an increase of license revenues for increased slightly to million from million in this modest increase in license revenues reflected a number of factors which affected us during  including an overall decrease in revenue growth rates in the rdbms industry worldwide  continued uncertainty in the asia pacific economies and financial markets as well as changes to our european management 
our increased focus on reseller channels in resulted in a significant build up of licenses that had not been resold or utilized by the resellers 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  revenue from license agreements with resellers is recognized as earned by us when the licenses are resold or utilized by the reseller and all of our related obligations have been satisfied 
accordingly  amounts received from customers and financial institutions in advance of revenue being recognized are recorded as a liability in advances from customers and financial institutions in our consolidated financial statements 
advances in the amount of million and million had not been recognized as earned revenue as of december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we received million in customer advances and recognized revenue from previously recorded customer advances of million 
included in the million recognized were million of licenses which were resold or utilized by the reseller  million related to contractual reductions in customer advances and million related to previously deferred revenue for solution sales which has now been recognized 
contractual reductions result from settlements between us and resellers in which the customer advance contractually expires or a settlement is structured wherein the rights to resell our products terminate without sell through or deployment of the software 
as of december   we had reached structured settlements with three resellers with remaining rights to resell a total of million of our products  which will be utilized by december  pursuant to the minimum future reduction terms of the settlement 
management believes that the level of licenses sold through these resellers is likely to continue  however  revenue may not be sustained following full utilization of the advances from customers and financial institutions because there may be less incentive for resellers to sell our products 
in order to properly recognize revenue on arrangements where the reseller has duplication rights  we rely on accurate and timely reports from resellers of the quantity of licenses that have been resold or utilized 
in instances where a reseller does not submit a timely report  we accrue royalty revenue through the end of the reporting period provided we have vendor specific historical information 
from time to time  late or inaccurate reports are identified or corrected for a variety of reasons  including resellers updating their reports or as a result of our proactive activities such as audits of the resellers royalty reports 
as a result  audits form these late or updated reports  which was not previously accrued  is recognized in the period during which the reports are received 
such revenue amounted to approximately million for and was not significant for we expect that the late or inaccurate reporting of resale or utilization of licenses by resellers and the resulting fluctuations will continue for the foreseeable future 
our license transactions can be relatively large in size and difficult to forecast both in timing and dollar value 
as a result  license transactions have caused fluctuations in net revenues and net income loss because of the relatively high gross margin on such revenues 
as is common in the industry  a disproportionate amount of our license revenue is derived from transactions that close in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
the timing of closing large license agreements also increases the risk of quarter to quarter fluctuations 
we expect that these types of transactions and the resulting fluctuations in revenue will continue 
service revenues 
service revenues are comprised of maintenance  consulting and training revenues 
service revenues increased to million in and to million in from million in service revenues accounted for   and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in service revenues  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  was attributable primarily to the renewal of maintenance contracts in connection with our growing installed customer base 
as our products continue to grow in complexity  more support services are expected to be required 
we intend to satisfy this requirement through internal support  third party services and oem support 
maintenance revenues increased to million for and to million for from million for consulting and training revenues increased to million for and remained flat at million for as compared to million in costs and expenses cost of software distribution 
cost of software distribution consists primarily of manufacturing and related costs such as media  documentation  product assembly and purchasing costs  freight  customs and third party royalties  and amortization of previously capitalized software development costs and any write offs of previously capitalized software 
cost of software distribution increased million  or  to million for compared to million for this increase was primarily due to an increase in royalties related to new products and the write off of capitalized software costs 
during the third quarter of  approximately million of previously capitalized software costs were written down to the estimated net realizable value after it was determined that the projected sales of certain tools products and system management programs were not sufficient to realize the capitalized product development costs 
amortization of capitalized software remained relatively flat at million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the amortization of capitalized software will vary from period to period as new products are released and other products become fully amortized 
cost of software distribution decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily caused by a write down in of million to net realizable value of certain of our database tool products related to our acquisition of centerview software  inc in the first quarter of  a decrease in third party software royalties  the write off of certain unused application software in the second quarter of and a reduction in labor  materials and shipping costs 
cost of services 
cost of services consists primarily of maintenance  consulting and training expenses 
cost of services for increased to million from million in due primarily to a increase in average headcount during  a portion of which resulted from the addition of the red brick consulting team subsequent to the completion of the acquisition in december cost of services decreased as a percentage of net service revenues to for compared to for the increase in gross service margins from in to during was due to a higher percentage of customer maintenance support revenue in which typically has a higher profit margin than consulting and training services revenue 
maintenance represented approximately of service revenues in compared to in cost of services for decreased by to million as compared to million in and decreased as a percentage of net service revenues to for compared to for these decreases were primarily attributable to decreases of in average headcount for over the same period in as well as improved efficiency and better control of outsourced expenses 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  marketing and communications programs and related overhead costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for from million for due primarily to increased advertising and marketing efforts during in connection with the introduction of several new products and our new corporate logo and identity in order to increase brand awareness 
this increase was in line with net revenue growth rates as sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were and for and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for from million for the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in as compared to was primarily the result of a significant reduction in average sales and marketing headcount worldwide 
we intend to invest more resources in marketing and communications programs during than we have in recent years in order to attempt to create greater market awareness and visibility 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  project consulting and related overhead costs for product development 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million for and million for the increase in research and development expenses during was attributable primarily to increased amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of red brick and a slight increase in average headcount during  offset by an increase of million in the amount of product development expenditures capitalized in compared to the increase for was primarily due to increased salary and benefits and a decrease in the amount of product development expenditures capitalized in compared to this decrease in capitalized expenditures was attributable to the fact that  during the first half of  a large portion of expenditures incurred were on products that had reached technological feasibility but had not yet been commercially released 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses have decreased slightly to for  from and for and  respectively  which is the level that we believe is consistent with our long term objectives for research and development spending 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of finance  legal  information systems  human resources  bad debt expense and related overhead costs 
general and administrative expenses were million in as compared with million in  an increase of 
during  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to from in during  general and administrative expenses decreased to million from million for the decrease in in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues was primarily the result of a reduction in bad debt expense due to our efforts to better manage both the amount and credit risk of our accounts receivable balances  offset by increases in legal and other professional service fees  consulting fees and average headcount 
write off of goodwill and other long term assets 
during the first quarter of  our japanese subsidiary experienced a significant sales shortfall and operating losses 
accordingly  we evaluated the ongoing value of the subsidiary s long lived assets primarily computer and other equipment and goodwill 
based on this evaluation  we determined that the subsidiary s assets had been impaired and wrote them down by million to their estimated fair values 
fair value was determined by using estimated future discounted cash flows and or resale market quotes as appropriate 
write off of acquired research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of red brick in december  and our acquisition of centerview software  inc centerview in february  we recorded charges of million and million in and  respectively 
our december  acquisition of red brick has been accounted for as a purchase 
we issued approximately million shares of our common stock to acquire all of the outstanding shares of red brick common stock 
we also reserved an additional million shares of our common stock for issuance in connection with the assumption of red brick s outstanding stock options and warrants 
the purchase price was allocated to the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the total purchase price of million included the issuance of stock and the assumption of stock options together million  net of issuance costs  direct acquisition costs of million  accrued merger and integration costs of million and liabilities assumed of million 
of the total purchase price  million was allocated to in process research and development expense that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses  million was allocated to cash and short term investments  approximately million was allocated to other tangible assets  million was allocated to capitalized software  million was allocated to the acquired workforce and million was allocated to goodwill 
goodwill  capitalized software and the acquired workforce are intangible assets which are being amortized over their estimated lives  which average five years 
the following two in process research and development projects were acquired in the acquisition of red brick red brick warehouse warehouse a high performance  client server rdbms software product specifically designed for data warehousing  data mart  data mining  and olap applications 
warehouse has been red brick s core product and  as of december  the valuation date  was being sold as version  which was released in january we released informix red brick warehouse version on schedule during may red brick formation formation an etml extract  transfer  move  load product which was originally released as version in september the current version as of the valuation date 
formation is considered to be in the early stages of its product life cycle 
new features and functionality are currently under development and will be added in subsequent releases 
we released red brick version on schedule during may and we are currently in the process of evaluating the future use of formation version due to the acquisition of similar technology as a result of the pending merger with ardent 
the fair value of the in process technology was based on a discounted cash flow model  similar to the traditional income approach 
the income approach involves five steps the annual after tax cash flows the asset will generate over its remaining useful life are estimated  these cash flows are converted to their present value equivalents using a required rate of return which accounts for the relative risk of not realizing the annual cash flows and for the time value of money  the residual value  if any  of the asset at the end of its remaining useful life is estimated  the estimated residual value is converted to its present value equivalent  and the present value of the estimated annual after tax cash flows is added to the present value of the residual value to obtain an estimate of the asset s fair value 
the discount rate used in discounting the estimated cash flows is based on the risks associated with achieving such estimated cash flows upon successful completion of the acquired projects 
associated risks include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  and risks related to the impact of potential changes in market conditions and technology 
in developing cash flow estimates  revenues were forecasted based on relevant factors  including aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole  characteristics of the potential market for the technology and the anticipated life of the underlying technology 
projected annual revenues for the warehouse and formation projects were assumed to increase from product release through  decline slightly in and decline significantly in which is estimated to be the end of the in process technology s economic life 
cost of software distribution and services  sales and marketing expense  research and development expense and general and administrative expense were estimated as a percentage of revenues throughout the forecast period 
gross profit was assumed to be between and for both the warehouse project and the formation project 
as certain other assets contribute to the cash flow attributable to the two projects  returns to these other assets or capital charges were calculated and deducted from the after tax operating income to isolate the cash flow solely attributable to the two projects 
accordingly  returns were deducted for working capital  fixed assets ie property and equipment and the workforce in place 
informix then discounted the estimated cash flows attributable to warehouse and formation using a discount rate 
the fair value of the in process research and development was allocated as approximately million and million to the warehouse and formation projects  respectively 
the acquisition of red brick was a tax free reorganization under the internal revenue code 
therefore  the charge for in process research and development and amortization of acquired intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes 
in february  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of centerview  a privately owned company which developed and sold software application development tools 
the aggregate purchase price paid was approximately million  which included cash and direct acquisition costs 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and  based on an independent appraisal of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  the purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired including developed software technology  acquired workforce  in process technology  and goodwill 
the in process technology  which  based on the independent appraisal  was valued at million  had not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition and had no alternative future uses in other research and development projects 
consequently  its value was charged to operations in the first quarter of fiscal  the period in which the acquisition was consummated 
the remaining identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over three to five years 
the in process research and development project acquired in the acquisition of centerview consisted of the client server software  data director  that combines the functionality of high end client server tools with the price and openness of visual programming environments 
data director is an integrated development extension for microsoft visual basic that enables companies to build corporate intranet and client server applications in a single environment 
as of the date of acquisition  data director version was considered developed technology while data director versions and were considered in process technology which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have any alternative future uses 
data director version was scheduled for first customer release in july while version was anticipated to reach first customer release in april  with commercial release to occur approximately two to three months after first customer introduction of the product 
the expected aggregate costs to complete both data director versions and were approximately million 
the fair value of the in process technology was based on projected cash flows which were discounted based on the risks associated with achieving such projected cash flows upon successful completion of the acquired projects 
associated risks include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  and risks related to the impact of potential changes in market conditions and technology 
in developing cash flow projections  revenues were forecasted based on relevant factors  including aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole and for the database application development market  product family revenues  the aggregate size of the database application development market  anticipated product development and product introduction schedules  product sales cycles  and the estimated life of the underlying technology 
projected annual revenues for the data director in process development projects were assumed to increase from product release through  decline slightly in and decline significantly in  which was estimated to be the end of the in process technology s economic life 
gross profit was assumed to be throughout the technology life cycle based on percentages estimated in informix s aggregate business model 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and capital charges to provide a return on other acquired assets were deducted from gross profit to arrive at net operating income 
operating expenses were estimated as a percentage of revenue and included general and administrative expenses  sales and marketing expenses and development costs to maintain the technology once it achieved technological feasibility 
the net cash flows of the in process research and development projects were discounted to their present values using a discount rate of 
this discount rate approximated the overall rate of return for the acquisition of centerview as a whole and reflected the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in process research and development projects and the uncertainty of technological advances 
we are currently selling two versions of data director  one for visual basic applications and the other for web applications 
merger and restructuring charges 
during the quarter ended december   we recorded a charge of million associated with the merger with cloudscape 
this amount included million for financial advisor  legal and accounting fees related to the merger and million for costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies  including expenditures of million for severance and related costs  million for closure of facilities and million for the write off of redundant assets 
accrued merger costs totaling million remained as a liability in our consolidated financial statements as of december  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in june and september  we approved plans to restructure our operations to bring expenses in line with forecasted revenues and substantially reduced our worldwide headcount and modified operations to improve efficiency 
accordingly  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million for the significant components of these restructuring changes were severance and benefits  write off of assets  and facility charges 
severance and benefits represented the reduction of approximately employees  primarily sales and marketing personnel  on a worldwide basis 
temporary employees and contractors were also reduced 
write off of assets included the write off or write down in carrying value of equipment as a result of our decision to reduce the number of information superstores throughout the world  as well as the write off of equipment associated with headcount reductions 
the equipment subject to the write offs and write downs consisted primarily of computer servers  workstations  and personal computers that were no longer utilized in our operations 
facility charges included early termination costs associated with the closing of certain domestic and international sales offices 
during and  adjustments of million and million  respectively  were recorded to the results of operations 
these adjustments  which appear as a credit to restructuring charges in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  and  were due primarily to adjusting the estimated severance and facility components of the restructuring charge to actual costs incurred 
we have substantially completed actions associated with our restructuring except for subleasing or settling our remaining long term operating leases related to vacated properties 
the terms of these operating leases expire at various dates through accrued restructuring costs totaling million remained as a liability in our consolidated financial statements as of december   all of which related to facility charges 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
other income expense interest income 
interest income for was million as compared to million and million for and  respectively 
excluding approximately million of interest income related to income tax refunds received in fiscal  interest income earned during on cash and short term investments actually increased by over this increase is consistent with the increase in the average interest bearing cash and short term investment balances during when compared to the same period in the increase in when compared to also resulted from an increase in the average interest bearing cash and short term investment balances in due to increased sales and operating income as well as approximately million in interest income related to income tax refunds received during interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million for from million and million for and  respectively 
these decreases are due primarily to a decline in the amortization of interest charges incurred in connection with the financing of customer accounts receivable prior to  in addition to a decline in interest charges related to payments on capital leases 
we did not enter into any accounts receivable financing transactions in and litigation settlement expense 
during  we incurred a charge of million in connection with our entering into a memorandum of understanding regarding the settlement of the private securities and related litigation against us 
the charge consists of million in cash  million in common stock and approximately million in legal fees required to obtain and complete the settlement 
the charge excludes approximately million of insurance proceeds which  according to the terms of the memorandum of understanding  were contributed directly by our insurance carriers 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  increased to net other income of million for from a net other expense of million for for  other income included approximately million of net realized gains on the sale of long term investments  offset by a downward adjustment of million to the carrying value of certain investments and approximately million of net foreign currency transaction losses 
during  other income expense  net  decreased to a net other expense of million from net other income of million for other income expense  included million of foreign currency transaction losses and million of foreign currency transaction gains in and  respectively 
approximately million of the million of foreign currency transaction gains recognized in resulted primarily from a change in our foreign currency denominated intercompany accounts payable and accounts receivable balances arising from the restatement of our  and financial statements 
other components of other income expense for included million of net realized gains on the sale of long term investments offset by a downward adjustment of million to the carrying value of certain investments 
income taxes in  income tax expense of million resulted primarily from foreign withholding taxes and taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we have provided a valuation allowance for the net deferred tax assets that are dependent on taxable income beyond in foreign jurisdictions  and domestic taxable income 
the expected tax expense of million  computed by applying the federal statutory rate of to the income before income taxes  was offset primarily by a million decrease in the valuation allowance and a million net foreign tax expense 
in  income tax expense resulted primarily from foreign withholding taxes and taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we have provided a valuation allowance for the net deferred tax assets that are dependent on future taxable income 
the expected tax expense of million  computed by applying the federal statutory rate of to the income before income taxes  was offset primarily by a million decrease in the valuation allowance and a million net foreign tax benefit 
in  income tax expense resulted primarily from foreign withholding taxes and taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the expected tax benefit computed by applying the federal statutory rate to the loss before income taxes was substantially offset by a corresponding increase in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
we have provided a valuation allowance for the net deferred tax assets in excess of amounts recoverable through carryback of net operating losses 
accordingly  the net deferred tax asset at december  of million was provided for anticipated irs tax refunds  which were received during quarterly operating results first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands  except per share data year ended december  net revenues     gross profit     net income loss     preferred stock dividend net income loss applicable to common stockholders     net income loss per common share basic diluted year ended december  net revenues     gross profit     net income loss    preferred stock dividend  value assigned to warrants  net income loss applicable to common stockholders     net income loss per common share basic diluted year ended december  net revenues     gross profit     net income loss     preferred stock dividend value assigned to warrants  net income loss applicable to common stockholders     net income loss per common share basic diluted in the first quarter of  we experienced a substantial shortfall in license revenues compared to forecasts  resulting in a substantial loss for the quarter 
the shortfall in revenue was due to slow growth in demand for rdbms products as well as our inability to close a number of sales transactions that management anticipated would close by the end of the quarter  especially in europe 
as a result of the shortfall in license revenues for this quarter  we  in the second and third quarters of  initiated two internal restructurings of our operations intended to reduce operating expenses and improve our financial condition 
these restructurings included reductions in headcount and leased facilities and the downsizing  elimination or conversion into solutions labs of our planned information superstores 
costs associated with the restructurings totaled approximately million and had a material adverse impact on our results of operations for see restructuring charges 
additionally  during  we had a major restatement for all of the periods included in the three years ended december   as well as for the quarter ended march  at that time  our administrative processes were weak which contributed to the existence of significant weaknesses in our internal controls 
following these events  customers were concerned about informix s viability and  accordingly  our management was concerned about whether customers would honor their financial obligations to us 
the restructuring activities and the restatement of financial results impacted the environment in which we operated  and  accordingly  impacted the estimates and assumptions used by management in the preparation of our financial statements 
as of december   we made certain estimates including allowances for uncollectable accounts receivable based on the probability of collections  estimates for product returns associated with ongoing customer uncertainty about our financial condition and contingencies associated with continuing issues related to these estimates  in the ordinary course of business  change as a result of management actions and environmental changes 
during the last quarter of and the first two quarters of  we took a number of actions to help restore customer confidence regarding the ongoing viability of informix 
these actions included i generating a total of million proceeds from an offering of series b preferred stock and the exercise of warrants related to outstanding series a preferred stock and increasing the balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  ii visits to key customers by senior management to reinforce our customers confidence in us  iii signing significant new contracts with existing customers and winning new customers in a variety of application areas including data warehousing and web content management  iv demonstrating continued ability to generate a meaningful revenue stream  v decreasing employee turnover and increasing the ability to attract new employees and senior management talent  and vi introducing significant new products and increasing research and development funding 
all of these factors contributed to customers honoring their financial obligations to informix  while reducing the probability of product return and collections problems 
additionally  during the first two quarters of  the following actions were taken and improvements made in the quality of our accounts receivable balances 
the actions taken included i centralizing european credit and collections for most countries and outsourcing this function to a professional credit and collections firm  ii improving our europe region s accounts receivable aging from a balance of million outstanding greater than days as of december  to a balance of million outstanding greater than days as of june   and iii refining our methodology for estimating general uncollectible accounts receivable over and above specific accounts receivable reserves 
the improvement in both our financial condition and the credit and collections processes which resulted from our actions led to a decrease of risk such that reserves for product return and bad debts were reduced by million and million in the first and second quarters of  respectively 
we believe the actions taken by management improved our operating environment and helped restore customer confidence in our company and its products 
as of december   our accrued liabilities included accruals for certain claims against us 
during the first quarter of  our lawyers determined that there was no merit to a specific claim for which we had recorded a liability of million 
accordingly  we reversed this million accrual during the first quarter of in addition  we reduced an accrued liability related to another specific claim by million and million during the second and third quarters of  respectively  based on a legal opinion and a settlement offer 
we recorded restructuring charges of million and million in the second and third quarters of  respectively 
the total restructuring expense decreased by million during the fourth quarter of primarily due to adjusting the original estimate of the loss incurred on the sale of land to the actual loss 
we recorded restructuring related adjustments to decrease restructuring expense by million  million  million and million in the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of  respectively  and million during the first quarter of primarily due to adjusting the estimated severance and facility charges to actual costs incurred 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of million to write down the carrying values of certain of our japanese subsidiary s long lived assets to their fair values 
during the same quarter  we also recorded a charge of million to write down the carrying value of capitalized software development costs for certain products to their net realizable values 
in connection with our acquisition of red brick in december  we recorded a charge to operations in the fourth quarter of of million for in process research and development which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
in connection with our acquisition of cloudscape in october  we recorded a charge of million to operations in the fourth quarter of for merger costs 
during the second quarter of  we incurred a charge of million in connection with our entering into a memorandum of understanding regarding the settlement of the private securities and related litigation against us 
liquidity and capital resources as of or for the year ended december  in millions cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital deficit cash and cash equivalents provided by used in operations cash and cash equivalents used for investment activities cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities operating cash flows 
we generated positive cash flows from operations totaling million for primarily from improved operating profitability and a reduction in cash outflows for accounts payable and accrued liabilities offset by an increase in the amount of license revenue recognized from customer advances and an increase in the effect of changes in current assets and deferred maintenance revenue on operating cash flows 
investing cash flows 
net cash and cash equivalents used for investing activities increased by approximately million for when compared to this increase was due primarily to a net increase of approximately million in our investment in available for sale securities of excess cash generated from operating income during other significant changes in investing activities during when compared to include a million decrease in purchases of strategic investments  an increase in proceeds from the sale of strategic investments of million  an increase in capital expenditures of million and an increase in the capitalization of software development costs of million 
financing cash flows 
net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities during consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of our common stock and advances from customers and financial institutions offset by principal payments on capital leases and payments for structured settlements with resellers 
the million decrease in cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities during when compared to was due primarily to net proceeds of million received by us during from the issuance of  additional shares of our series a preferred stock at per share and net proceeds of approximately million received during from the issuance of convertible preferred stock by cloudscape  which was subsequently converted into common stock prior to the cloudscape merger 
summary 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months

actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of debt securities with an average maturity of less than two years 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december  and  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
equity security price risk 
we hold a small portfolio of marketable equity traded securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity price fluctuations of plus or minus would have had a million and million impact on the value of these securities in and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies primarily european and asian currencies until such receivables are collected and payables are disbursed 
a foreign currency forward exchange contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
these foreign exchange forward contracts are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying foreign receivables or payables are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date which approximate the value and expected settlement date of the underlying transactions 
for contracts that are designated and effective as hedges  discounts or premiums the difference between the spot exchange rate and the forward exchange rate at inception of the contract are accreted or amortized to other expenses over the contract lives using the straight line method while unrealized gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period resulting from changes in the spot exchange rate are recognized in earnings in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables or payables are recognized  and generally offset 
we operate in certain countries in latin america  eastern europe  and asia pacific where there are limited forward foreign currency exchange markets and thus we have unhedged exposures in these currencies 
most of our international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
although we take into account changes in exchange rates over time in our pricing strategy  we do so only on an annual basis  resulting in substantial pricing exposure as a result of foreign exchange volatility during the period between annual pricing reviews 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is relatively long  depending on a number of factors including the level of competition and the size of the transaction 
we periodically assess market conditions and occasionally reduce this exposure by entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge up to of the forecasted net income of our foreign subsidiaries of up to one year in the future 
these forward foreign currency exchange contracts do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes and  therefore  are marked to market 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risk  there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount contract amount  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value 
fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate at december  and the forward rate  plus the unamortized premium or discount 
all contracts mature within twelve months 
forward contracts weighted average at december  contract amount contract rate fair value in thousands in thousands forward currency to be sold under contract euro  korean won  czech koruna  singapore dollar  thai bhat  australian dollar  other individually less than million  total  forward currency to be purchased under contract british pound  japanese yen  other individually less than million total  grand total  not meaningful year compliance general many computer systems and software products were originally coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies needed to be upgraded to comply with year requirements prior to january  prior to january   significant uncertainties existed in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
now that january  has come and gone with very few significant reported year related incidents  the level of uncertainty surrounding such incidents has diminished 
our original year compliance efforts included reviewing and updating the year compliance status of the software and systems used in our internal business processes obtaining appropriate assurances of compliance from the manufacturers of these products and agreements  as necessary  to modify or replace all non compliant products this program was substantially completed by december  in addition  we converted certain of our software and systems to commercial products from third parties that were known to be year compliant 
this conversion required the dedication of substantial time from our administrative and management information personnel the assistance of consulting personnel from third party software vendors the training of our personnel using such systems based on the information available to date  we believe that we were able to complete our year compliance review and make necessary modifications prior to the end of to the extent that we will continue to rely on the products of other vendors to resolve year issues  there can be no guarantee that we will not experience delays in implementing such products 
we could incur substantial costs and disruption of our business if key systems  or a significant number of systems  were to fail as a result of year problems or if we were to experience delays in implementing year compliant software products 
state of readiness our year project was divided into four major sections product readiness information systems operations applications software is systems third party suppliers global business processes includes facilities  legal  manufacturing  technical support  sales  product management and development  marketing and finance there were five general phases of our year project applicable to each of the four sections awareness phase 
increasing employee awareness through various forms of communication mission critical inventory phase 
taking an inventory of mission critical items relevant to year including computer hardware  software  telecommunications equipment  embedded controllers within our facilities  and other non computer related equipment  assigning priorities to identified items for assessment and possible renovation  and assessing the status of year compliance of items which we have determined to be material to our business repair or replace phase 
repairing or replacing material items that are not year compliant 
material items are those items that we believe have a significant negative impact on customer service  involve a risk to the safety of individuals  may cause damage to property or the environment  or may significantly affect revenue update testing phase 
testing of updates given by third party suppliers business contingency phase 
designing and implementing contingency plans for each internal organization and critical location during the year rollover period as of december  we had substantially completed all of the phases for each of the four sections of the project 
product readiness 
all of our currently supported products are year compliant  meaning that the use or occurrence of dates on or after january  will not adversely affect the performance or functionality of our products with respect to four digit year dates or the ability of our products to correctly create  store  process  and output information related to such date data  including leap year calculations 
however  year compliance of our products may be affected by other parts of the system in which they are being used  as discussed below 
our products often depend on data from other parts of the system in which they are being used 
year compliance is not effective unless all of the hardware  operating system  other software  and firmware being used along with our products correctly interpret and or translate date data into a four digit year date and properly exchange date data with our products 
we have tested our currently supported products under different year test scenarios 
we will continue to improve our testing efforts with each new release of our software products 
from time to time  our year program office has updated the history table of each product family when a year or dbcentury related product deficiency was found and fixed in a certain interim or maintenance release 
we have made year testing scenarios part of our standard test suite 
our year program office finished incorporating the red brick product compliance information and plans into our year program plan during the first quarter of informix did not experience any year related issues with cloudscape products or facilities 
is systems 
is operations systems 
our is operations systems consist of all computer hardware  systems software and telecommunications 
our current hardware inventory includes pc desktops  pc laptops  unix servers  unix workstations  and nt workgroup servers 
our current software inventory includes windows operating system and ms office products  product development environment tools for unix  and various management systems 
our telecommunications equipment includes both voice and data services  including pbx systems  voicemail  acd  video conferencing  local area networks  wide area networks  and remote access equipment 
we completed remediation of all mission critical is operations components by the end of december non critical systems were also made year compliant by november testing was ongoing as hardware or system software was renovated or replaced  although  the level of testing was significantly limited by our technical ability to emulate our complex systems and networks and cost benefit considerations 
we began contingency planning in december  completed draft contingency plans by september and continued to refine and rehearse through the end of december is applications systems 
our is applications systems consist of all enterprise wide applications either supplied by third party vendors or internally developed 
we completed our remediation efforts of all mission critical is applications by the end of march we made all important and non important is applications systems year compliant by the end of december none of our other information technology projects have been delayed due to the implementation of the year project 
third party suppliers 
we identified and prioritized critical suppliers and communicated with them about our plans and progress in addressing the year problem and how their individual compliance could impact our success 
we completed detailed evaluations of most critical suppliers 
these evaluations were followed by the development and implementation of contingency plans where appropriate  which began  in certain departments  in the fourth quarter of and drafted by the end of september follow up reviews with each of our critical suppliers were completed by the end of december in order to ascertain alternative communication channels and emergency procedures in the event of widespread outages 
global business processes 
we have completed the assessment of the hardware  software and associated embedded computer chips that are used in the operation of all of our critical facilities 
all repair and testing of embedded systems within our critical facilities was completed by the end of december we have also completed the preparation in our key business areas  including finance  product development and legal 
customer service completed their support plans for the year rollover weekend  and documented their offerings on the informix year web site 
we began contingency planning for these organizations and their respective critical business processes in the first quarter of  and were completed with such planning  testing and training by december costs the total cost associated with required modifications to become year compliant is not expected to be material to our financial position 
the estimated total cost of the year project is approximately million 
the total amount expended on the project through december  was approximately million 
the estimated future cost of completing the year project is estimated to be approximately million 
our year project is expected to significantly reduce our level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of our material third party suppliers 
we believe that the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations has been reduced with the implementation of new business systems and the completion of the project as scheduled 
however  although the rollover from to has passed  many software industry experts believe that there is still reason to expect the occurrence of the year related incidents of some kind or the other 
to date  we have not experienced any disruption of our business or key systems as a result of year problems 
similarly  we have not been informed of any year problems encountered by our customers relating to their use of our software products 
it is possible  however  that informix or its customers may encounter year problems at a later time 
if such problems were to arise  we could incur substantial costs or the interruption in or a failure of certain normal business activities or operations  which could hurt our business 
if our customers experience year related problems as a result of their use of our software products  then those customers could assert claims for damages which  if successful  could result in significant costs  damage our operations or adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
european monetary conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european economic community entered into a three year transition phase during which a common currency  the euro  was introduced 
between january  and january   governments  companies and individuals may conduct business in these countries in both the euro and existing national currencies 
on january   the euro will become the sole currency in these countries 
during the transition phase  we will continue to evaluate the impact of conversion to the euro on our business 
in particular  we are reviewing whether our internal software systems can process transactions denominated either in current national currencies or in the euro  including converting currencies using computation methods specified by the european economic community the cost to us if we must modify or replace any of our internal software systems whether we will have to change the terms of any financial instruments in connection with our hedging activities based on current information and our initial evaluation  we do not expect the cost of any necessary corrective action to have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have reviewed the effect of the conversion to the euro on the prices of our products in the affected countries 
as a result  we have made some adjustments to our prices to attempt to eliminate differentials that were identified 
however  we will continue to evaluate the impact of these and other possible effects of the conversion to the euro on our business 
we cannot guarantee that the costs associated with conversion to the euro or price adjustments will not in the future have a material adverse effect on our business 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application of sfas is encouraged but should not be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our operating results  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the aicpa issued statement of position sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
this amendment clarified the specification of what was considered vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various elements in a multiple element arrangement 
sop is effective for all transactions entered into by us beginning in fiscal year the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our operating results  financial position or cash flows 
recent developments on february   international business machines corporation ibm filed an action against us in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging infringement of six united states patents owned by ibm 
the informix products that ibm alleges infringe its patents are informix online dynamic server versions  and  informix se version  informix newera version  informix net  informix star  illustra visual information retrieval  and illustra visual intelligence viewer 
in its complaint  ibm seeks a permanent injunction against further alleged infringement  unspecified compensatory damages  unspecified treble damages  and interest  costs and attorneys fees 
we strongly believe that the allegations in the complaint are without merit and intend to defend the action vigorously and to assert such counterclaims against ibm as may be appropriate 
factors that may affect future results current and potential stockholders should consider carefully each of the following factors in making their investment decisions 
these factors should be considered together with the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k 
risk factors our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors  which could result in our failing to achieve revenue or profitability expectations 
our quarterly and annual results of operations have varied significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary in the future due to a number of factors described below and elsewhere in this managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations section  many of which are beyond our control 
any one or more of the factors listed below or other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our revenue or profitability expectations 
in particular  the failure to meet market expectations could cause a sharp drop in our stock price 
these factors include changes in demand for our products and services  including changes in industry growth rates  the size  timing and contractual terms of large orders for our software products  adjustments of delivery schedules to accommodate customer or regulatory requirements  the budgeting cycles of our customers and potential customers  any downturn in our customers businesses  in the domestic economy or in international economies where our customers do substantial business  changes in our pricing policies resulting from competitive pressures  such as aggressive price discounting by our competitors or other factors  our ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new or enhanced versions of our products and solutions  changes in the mix of revenues attributable to domestic and international sales  and seasonal buying patterns which tend to peak in the fourth quarter 
intense competition could adversely affect our ability to sell our products or grow our business 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and or future competitors and such inability could impair our ability to sell our products 
the market for our products is highly competitive  diverse and is subject to rapid change 
moreover  we expect that the technology for database products generally  and  in particular  the technology underlying database solutions and products for the internet and datawarehousing products  will continue to change rapidly 
for example  as customers embrace the internet  we need to develop and enhance our software solutions to support internet applications 
it is possible that our products will be rendered obsolete by technological advances 
we currently face competition from a number of sources  including several large vendors that develop and market databases  applications  development tools  decision support products  consulting services and or complete database driven solutions for the internet 
our principal competitors include computer associates  ibm  microsoft  ncr teradata  oracle and sybase 
additionally  as we expand our business in the markets of datawarehousing and web e commerce  we expect to compete with a different group of companies  including small  highly focused companies offering single products or services that we include as part of an overall solution 
a number of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have 
as a result  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  evolving markets and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
competition may affect the pricing of our products or services  and changes in product mix may occur  either of which may reduce our margins 
existing and future competition or changes in our product or service pricing structure or product or service offerings could result in an immediate reduction in the prices of our products or services 
also  a significant change in the mix of software products and services that we sell  including the mix between higher margin software and maintenance products and lower margin consulting and training  could materially adversely affect our operating results for future quarters 
additionally  if significant price reductions in our products or services were to occur and not be offset by increases in sales volume  our operating margins would be adversely affected 
for example  several of our competitors have announced the development of enhanced versions of their principal database products that are intended to improve the performance or expand the capabilities of their existing products 
new or enhanced products by existing competitors or new competitors could result in greater price pressure on both our products 
in addition  the following factors could affect the pricing of relational database management solutions products and related products the industry movement to new operating systems  like windows nt  linux and other low cost operating systems available through other appliances  access to relational database management solutions products through low end desktop computers  access to database driven solutions  including object relational database management systems products  through the internet  the bundling of software products for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy by competitors  and our own practice of bundling our software products for enterprise licenses or for promotional purposes with our partners 
in particular  the pricing strategies of competitors in the software database industry have historically been characterized by aggressive price discounting to encourage volume purchasing by customers 
we may not be able to compete effectively against competitors who continue to aggressively discount the prices of their products 
our proposed acquisition of ardent may not be approved by both companies stockholders or  if the acquisition is approved  difficulties integrating ardent may prevent us from realizing the benefits of the merger 
the completion of our proposed acquisition of ardent is subject to approval by both companies stockholders 
if the stockholders of either company do not approve the proposed acquisition  it would disrupt our operational plans and could harm our future operating results 
even if we complete the proposed acquisition  we could encounter difficulties integrating ardent s operations and personnel 
integration difficulties may disrupt the combined company s business and could prevent the achievement of the anticipated benefits of the merger 
the difficulties  costs and delays involved in integrating the companies  which may be substantial  may include distracting management and other key personnel  particularly sales and marketing personnel and senior engineers involved in product development and product definition  from the business of the combined company  inability to effectively market and distribute ardent s products or develop ardent technology so as to produce new or enhanced products that will be accepted in the marketplace  perceived and potential adverse changes in business focus or product offerings  failure to generate significant revenue from the sale of newly developed ardent products  failure to integrate complex software technology  product lines and software development plans  potential incompatibility of business cultures  costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures  particularly integrating different information systems  inability to retain and integrate key management  technical  sales and customer support personnel  inability to maintain ardent s existing relationships with its partners  inability to maintain ardent s existing customers base or replace the ardent products used by those customers with informix products  and disruption in our sales force may result in a loss of current customers or the inability to close sales with potential customers 
in addition  if we complete the acquisition  we will incur substantial transactional and integration expenses of approximately to million associated with combining the operations of the two companies and the fees of financial advisors  attorneys and accountants 
these expenses will prevent us from spending those amounts on other possibly more productive uses 
although we believe that the costs will not exceed this estimate  the estimate may be incorrect or unanticipated contingencies may occur that substantially increase the costs of combining ardent s operations with our own 
if we do not respond adequately to our industry s evolving technology standards or do not continue to meet the sophisticated needs of our customers  sales of our products may decline 
our future success will depend on our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and emerging hardware  software  database and networking platforms 
we will have to develop and introduce commercially viable enhancements to our existing products and solutions on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
if we do not enhance our products to meet these evolving needs  we will not sell as many products 
our position in existing  emerging or potential markets could be eroded rapidly by product advances 
our product development efforts will continue to require substantial financial and operational investment 
we may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary investment or to attract and retain qualified software development engineers 
in addition  we may not be able to internally develop new products or solutions quickly enough to respond to market forces 
as a result  we may have to acquire technology or access to products or solutions through mergers and acquisitions  investments and partnering arrangements 
we may not have sufficient cash  access to funding  or available equity to engage in such transactions 
moreover  we may not be able to forge partnering arrangements or strategic alliances on satisfactory terms  or at all  with the companies of our choice 
we have experienced  and anticipate that we will continue to experience  turnover at our senior management levels  which could harm our business and operations 
in july  we announced the appointment of jean yves f 
dexmier as a member of the board of directors and president and chief executive officer  while robert j 
finocchio resigned his position as president and chief executive officer 
mr 
finocchio continues to be actively involved in our management in his capacity as the chairman of the board 
during the past nine months  several of our senior executive officers have resigned  including our i vice president and treasurer  ii vice president  human resources and iii vice president  web and e commerce division  all three of whom have since been replaced  as well as the vice president  corporate controller  who resigned when we replaced the corporate controller position with two controller positions  both of which report directly to our chief financial officer 
also  our vice president  corporate marketing  resigned effective december  and our executive vice president and chief financial officer  howard a 
bain iii  resigned effective march  it is possible that this high turnover at our senior management levels will continue and that other senior executive officers could also resign 
of our senior executive officers and key employees  only robert j 
finocchio  chairman of the board  and the former president and chief executive officer  is bound by an employment agreement  the terms of which are nonetheless at will 
in addition  we do not maintain key man life insurance on our employees and have no plans to do so 
the loss of the services of one or more of our current senior executive officers or key employees could harm our business and could affect our ability to successfully implement our business objectives 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our current senior executives 
if we were to lose the services of one or more of our current senior executives or key employees  this could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and achieve our business objectives  particularly if one or more of those executives or key employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with informix 
our executive team may not be able to successfully work together to meet its business objectives 
since the beginning of  we have expanded our ability to deliver products and solutions for the internet  including e commerce solutions  and business intelligence solutions driven by our datawarehouse technology 
our management team has not worked together for a significant length of time and may not be able to successfully implement this strategy 
if the management team is unable to accomplish our business objectives  it could materially adversely affect our ability to grow our business 
as noted above  mr 
dexmier was appointed as the president and chief executive officer in july in addition  two new executive officers  the vice president and treasurer and the vice president  i 
intelligence business group  joined informix in july and the vice president  human resources  joined informix in october almost all of informix s other executive officers have joined the company since the beginning of fiscal we may not be able to retain our key personnel or  if we complete the acquisition of ardent  to integrate and retain ardent s key personnel  which may prevent us from meeting our business objectives 
we may not be able to retain our key personnel  including certain sales  consulting  technical and marketing personnel  or attract other qualified personnel in the future 
in addition  if we complete the acquisition of ardent we may not be able to retain ardent s key personnel  including its current management 
our success depends upon the continued service of key qualified personnel 
the competition to attract  retain and motivate these personnel is intense 
we have at times experienced  and continue to experience  difficulty recruiting qualified software  customer support and other personnel 
the loss of such key personnel could result in our inability to effectively develop  market and sell our products thereby harming our financial results 
any cancellations or delays in planned customer purchases of our products or services could materially adversely affect our net income and could substantially reduce quarterly revenues 
because we do not know when  or if  potential customers will place orders and finalize contracts  we cannot accurately predict revenue and operating results for future quarters 
if there is a downturn in potential customers businesses  the domestic economy in general  or in international economies where we derive substantial revenue  potential customers may defer or cancel planned purchases of our products 
because we base operating expenses on anticipated revenue levels and because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  delays in the recognition of revenues from even a limited number of product license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter  which could cause net income to fall significantly short of anticipated levels 
if a large number of the orders that are typically booked at the end of a quarter are not booked  our net income for that quarter could be substantially reduced 
our software license revenue in any quarter often depends on orders booked and shipped in the last month  weeks or days of that quarter 
at the end of each quarter  we typically have either minimal or no backlog of orders for the subsequent quarter 
if a large number of orders or several large orders do not occur or are deferred  revenue in that quarter could be substantially reduced 
seasonal trends in sales of our software products could adversely affect our quarterly operating results 
our sales of software products have been affected by seasonal purchasing trends that materially affect our quarter to quarter operating results 
we expect these seasonal trends to continue in the future 
revenue and operating results in our quarter ending december are typically higher relative to other quarters because many customers make purchase decisions based on their calendar year end budgeting requirements and because we measure our sales incentive plans for sales personnel on a calendar year basis 
as a result  we have historically experienced a substantial decline in revenue in the first quarter of each fiscal year relative to the preceding quarter 
the lengthy sales cycle for products makes revenues susceptible to fluctuations 
any delay in the sales cycle of a large transaction or a number of smaller transactions could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our sales cycles typically take many months to complete and vary depending on the product  service or solution that is being sold 
the length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which we have little or no control  including the size of a potential transaction and the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities 
the sales cycle can be further extended for sales made through third party distributors 
our future revenue and our ability to make investments in developing our products is substantially dependent upon our installed customer base continuing to license our products and renew our service agreements 
we depend on our installed customer base for future revenue from services and licenses of additional products 
if our customers fail to renew their maintenance agreements  our revenue will be harmed 
the maintenance agreements are generally renewable annually at the option of the customers and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
therefore  current customers may not necessarily generate significant maintenance revenue in future periods 
in addition  customers may not necessarily purchase additional products or services 
our services revenue and maintenance revenue also depend upon the continued use of these services by our installed customer base 
any downturn in software license revenue could result in lower services revenue in future quarters 
moreover  if either license revenue or revenue from services declines  we may not have sufficient cash to finance investments or acquire technology 
the success of our international operations is dependent upon many factors which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products internationally and could affect our profitability 
international sales represented approximately of our total revenue during the year ended december  the international operations are  and any expanded international operations will be  subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally that could adversely affect our ability to sell our products internationally  and therefore  our profitability  including the following difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  longer payment cycles  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  uncertainties relative to regional  political and economic circumstances  recessionary environments in foreign economies  and increases in tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers imposed by foreign countries 
in particular  instability in the asian pacific and latin american economies and financial markets  which together accounted for approximately of our total net revenues during the year ended december   could adversely affect our ability to sell our products internationally 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses 
despite efforts to manage foreign exchange risk  our hedging activities may not adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
as a consequence  we may incur losses in connection with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
most of our international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  it is not possible to predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
although we take into account changes in exchange rates over time in our pricing strategy  we do so only on an annual basis  resulting in substantial pricing exposure as a result of foreign exchange volatility during the period between annual pricing reviews 
in addition  as noted previously  the sales cycles for our products is relatively long 
foreign currency fluctuations could  therefore  result in substantial changes in the financial impact of a specific transaction between the time of initial customer contact and revenue recognition 
in addition to the hedging program  we have implemented a foreign exchange hedging program consisting principally of the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts in the primary european and asian currencies 
this program is intended to hedge the value of intercompany accounts receivable or intercompany accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies against fluctuations in exchange rates until such receivables are collected or payables are disbursed 
additionally  uncertainties related to the euro conversion could adversely affect our hedging activities 
if the internet does not continue to develop as we anticipate  or if our product offerings are not accepted in this market  we may not be able to grow our business 
the internet is a rapidly evolving market 
we are unable to predict whether and to what extent internet computing and electronic commerce will be embraced by consumers and traditional businesses 
our successful introduction of database driven products and solutions for the internet market will depend in large measure on the commitment by hardware and software vendors to manufacture  promote and distribute internet access appliances  the lower cost of ownership of internet computing relative to client server architecture  and the ease of use and administration relative to client server architecture 
in addition  if a sufficient number of vendors do not undertake a commitment to the market  the market may not accept internet computing or internet computing may not generate significant revenues for our business 
also  standards for network protocols  as well as other industry adopted and de facto standards for the internet  are evolving rapidly 
there can be no assurance that standards we have chosen will position our products to compete effectively for business opportunities as they arise on the internet 
the widespread acceptance and adoption of the internet by traditional businesses for conducting business and exchanging information is likely only if the internet provides these businesses with greater efficiencies and improvements 
the failure of the internet to continue to develop as a commercial or business medium could materially adversely affect our business 
even if the internet and electronic commerce are widely accepted and adopted by consumers and businesses  our database products and database driven solutions for the internet may not succeed 
we recently announced our intention to focus a substantial part of our product development and sales efforts on developing and selling technology and services for the internet market 
this market is new to our product development  marketing and sales organizations 
we may not be able to market and sell products and solutions in this market successfully 
in addition  our database products and database driven solutions for the internet may not compete effectively with our competitors products and solutions 
further  we may not generate significant revenue and or margin in this market 
any of these events could materially  adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
if the data warehouse market does not continue to grow  or if our product offerings in this market are not accepted  we may not be able to sell our products or grow our business 
the data warehouse market may not continue to grow  or may not grow rapidly  and our customers may not expand their use of data warehouse products 
in addition  we may not be able to market and sell our products and solutions in this market or otherwise compete effectively and generate significant revenue 
although demand for data warehouse software has grown in recent years  the market is still emerging 
our future financial performance in this area will depend to a large extent on continued growth in the number of organizations adopting data warehouses  our success in developing partnering arrangements with developers of software tools and applications for the data warehouse market  and existing customers expanding their use of data warehouses 
recent organizational changes could disrupt our business operations and could adversely affect the sales of our products 
on october   we reorganized our operating business divisions into four new business groups the transact business group  which is responsible for delivering on line transaction processing products  the i

we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of this reorganization 
in addition  the reorganization could disrupt our current business operations  including our product development and sales efforts 
further  any such disruption or other operational difficulty encountered while implementing the organization could distract our management team and cause uncertainty and confusion among our customers 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks and this would weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase costs 
our success will continue to be heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
these means of protecting proprietary rights may not be adequate  and the inability to protect intellectual property rights may adversely affect our business and or financial condition 
we currently hold eight united states patents and several pending applications 
there can be no assurance that any other patents covering our inventions will be issued or that any patent  if issued  will provide sufficiently broad protection or will prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringers 
our ability to sell our products and prevent competitors from misappropriating our proprietary technology and trade names is dependent upon protecting our intellectual property 
our products are generally licensed to end users on a right to use basis under a license that restricts the use of the products for the customer s internal business purposes 
we also rely on shrink wrap and click wrap licenses  which include a notice informing the end user that by opening the product packaging  or in the case of a click on license by clicking on an acceptance icon and downloading the product  the end user agrees to be bound by the license agreement 
despite such precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that is regarded as proprietary 
in addition  we have licensed the source code of our products to certain customers under certain circumstances and for restricted uses 
in addition  we have also entered into source code escrow agreements with a number of our customers that generally require release of source code to the customer in the event the company enters bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings or otherwise ceases to conduct business 
we may also be unable to protect our technology because competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology  policing unauthorized use of software is difficult  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights in software to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  shrink wrap and or click wrap licenses may be wholly or partially unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions  and litigation to enforce intellectual property rights  to protect trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
in the future  third parties could  for competitive or other reasons  assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
as discussed above under recent developments  ibm recently filed a lawsuit against us claiming that some of our products infringe certain of ibm s patents ibm claim 
other third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their proprietary rights 
these claims  with or without merit  could harm our business by increasing costs and by adversely affecting our ability to sell our products 
any claim of this type  including the ibm claim  could affect our relationships with our existing customers and prevent future customers from licensing our products 
any such claim  including the ibm claim  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or license agreements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
it is expected that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
errors in our products or the failure of products to conform to customer specifications or expectations could result in our customers demanding refunds from us  asserting claims for damages or limiting sales of products 
because our software products are complex  they often contain errors or bugs that can be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
while we continually test our products for errors and work with customers through our customer support services to identify and correct bugs in our software  it is expected that product errors will continue to be found in the future 
although many of these errors may prove to be immaterial  some could be significant 
detection of any significant errors may result in  among other things  loss of  or delay in  market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs 
the failure of our products to conform to customer specifications or expectations could result in decreased sales of our products 
a key determinative factor in future success will continue to be the ability of our products to operate and perform well with existing and future leading  industry standard application software products intended to be used in connection with relational and object relational database management system products 
failure to meet in a timely manner existing or future interoperability and performance requirements of certain independent vendors could adversely affect the market for our products 
commercial acceptance of our products and services could also be adversely affected by critical or negative statements or reports by brokerage firms  industry and financial analysts and industry periodicals about informix  its products or business  or by the advertising or marketing efforts of competitors  or by other factors that could adversely affect consumer perception 
potential year problems may occur which could result in significant costs to informix 
to date  we have not experienced any disruption of our business or key systems as a result of year problems 
similarly  we have not been informed of any year problems encountered by our customers relating to their use of our software products 
it is possible  however  that informix or its customers may encounter year problems at a later time 
if such problems were to arise  we could incur substantial costs or the interruption in or a failure of certain normal business activities or operations  which could hurt our business 
if our customers experience year related problems as a result of their use of our software products  then those customers could assert claims for damages which  if successful  could result in significant costs  damage our operations or adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
if the rdbms and ordbms markets do not grow as quickly as we anticipate  we may sell fewer products 
if the growth rates for the relational and object relational database management systems  or rdbms or ordbms  respectively  decline for any reason  there will be less demand for our products  which would have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
the future growth rate of the rdbms market cannot be predicted 
delays in market acceptance of our ordbms products could result in fewer product sales 
in recent years  the types and quantities of data required to be stored and managed has grown increasingly complex and includes  in addition to conventional character data  audio  video  text and three dimensional graphics in a high performance scalable environment 
since  we have invested substantial resources in developing our ordbms product line 
the market for ordbms products is new and evolving  and its growth depends upon a growing need to store and manage complex data and upon broader market acceptance of our products as a solution for this need 
organizations may not choose to make the transition from conventional rdbms products to ordbms products 
our inability to rely on the statutory safe harbor as a result of the settlement of the sec investigation could harm our business 
in july  the sec issued a formal order of private investigation of informix and certain unidentified other entities and persons with respect to accounting matters  public disclosures and trading activity in our securities that were not described in the formal order 
during the course of the investigation  we learned that the investigation concerned the events leading to the restatement of its financial statements  including fiscal years  and  that was publicly announced in november effective january   informix and the sec have entered into a settlement of the investigation as to informix 
pursuant to the settlement  we consented to the entry by the sec of an order instituting public administrative proceedings pursuant to section a of the securities act of and section c of the securities exchange act of  making findings  and imposing a cease and desist order 
pursuant to the order  we neither admitted nor denied the findings  except as to jurisdiction  contained in the order 
the order prohibits us from violating and causing any violation of the anti fraud provisions of the federal securities laws  for example by making materially false and misleading statements concerning its financial performance 
the order also prohibits us from violating or causing any violation of the provisions of the federal securities laws requiring informix to file accurate quarterly and annual reports with the sec  maintain accurate accounting books and records  and maintain adequate internal accounting controls 
pursuant to the order  we are also required to cooperate in the sec s continuing investigation of other entities and persons 
in the event that we violate the order  we could be subject to substantial monetary penalties 
as a consequence of the issuance of the order  we will not  for a period of three years from the date of the issuance of the order  be able to rely on the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the federal securities laws 
the safe harbor  among other things  limits potential legal actions against us in the event a forward looking statement concerning our anticipated performance turns out to be inaccurate  unless it can be proved that  at the time the statement was made  we actually knew that the statement was false 
if we become a defendant in any private securities litigation brought under the federal securities laws  our legal position in the litigation could be materially adversely affected by our inability to rely on the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements 
failure to continue to strengthen our internal accounting controls could adversely affect our business 
although we have made significant progress in our efforts to strengthen our accounting controls and processes  we may not be able to hire and retain enough finance personnel to continue to do so 
if we are unable to continue to strengthen our accounting controls and processes  that inability could adversely affect our ability to accurately forecast and report our financial results 
in addition  any customer uncertainty about our internal accounting controls could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products 
we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of future business acquisitions which could hurt our ability to grow its business and sell its products 
in the future we may acquire or invest in other businesses that offer products  services and technologies that we believe would help expand or enhance our products and services or help expand our distribution channels 
if we were to make such an acquisition or investment  the following risks could impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products and ultimately could impair our ability to sell our products difficulty in combining the technology  operations or work force of the acquired business  disruption of our on going businesses  difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction  difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel 
in addition  the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and common stock 
if the consideration is paid in the our common stock  existing stockholders would be further diluted 
any amortization of goodwill or other assets resulting from any acquisition could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the rights of our series b preferred stockholders may adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders 
holders of our series b preferred shares have certain rights that may adversely affect holders of our common stock 
at december    shares of our series b preferred stock remained outstanding 
rights to consent to corporate transactions 
our agreements with the purchasers of our series b preferred stock contain covenants that could impair our ability to engage in various corporate transactions in the future  including financing transactions and certain transactions involving a change in control or acquisition of our assets or equity  or that could otherwise be disadvantageous to informix and the holders of our common stock 
in particular  an acquisition of our assets or equity may not be effected without the consent of the holders of the outstanding series b preferred stock or without requiring the acquiring entity to assume the series b preferred stock or cause the series b preferred stock to be redeemed 
these provisions are likely to make an acquisition more difficult and expensive and could discourage potential acquirors 
we made certain covenants in connection with the issuance of the series b preferred stock which could limit our ability to obtain additional financing by  for example  providing the holders of the series b preferred stock certain rights of first offer and prohibiting informix from issuing additional preferred stock without the consent of the series b preferred stockholders 
conversion rights 
the shares of our series b preferred stock are convertible into shares of our common stock based on the trading prices of our common stock during future periods 
any conversion of series b preferred stock into our common stock will dilute the existing common stockholders 
we are also obligated to issue upon conversion of the series b preferred stock additional warrants to acquire shares of our common stock equal to of the total number of shares of common stock into which the series b preferred stock converts 
the exercise of these warrants will have further dilutive effect to the holders of our common stock 
as of december    shares of series b preferred stock remained outstanding and  assuming a per share conversion price  were convertible into  shares of our common stock  and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  additional shares of our common stock would become issuable upon such conversion 
if the conversion price of the series b preferred stock is determined during a period when the trading price of our common stock is low  the resulting number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred stock could result in greater dilution to the holders of our common stock 
as of december   series b preferred stockholders had converted an aggregate of  shares of series b preferred stock into  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
penalty provision 
the terms of our series b preferred financing agreements also include certain penalty provisions that are triggered if we fail to satisfy certain obligations 
for instance  we must keep a registration statement in effect for the resale of shares of our common stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred shares and upon exercise of the warrants 
we may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs 
we may be subject to claims for damages related to product errors in the future 
a material product liability claim could materially adversely affect our business because of the costs of defending against these types of lawsuits  diversion of key employees time and attention from the business and potential damage to our reputation 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entail the risk of such claims 
while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability  these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims 
such limitation of liability provisions may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions to the extent local laws treat certain warranty exclusions as unenforceable 
provisions in our charter documents with respect to undesignated preferred stock may discourage potential acquisition bids for informix 
our board of directors is authorized to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock in one or more series 
of the  shares of preferred stock   shares have been designated series a preferred  none of which is outstanding   shares have been designated series a preferred  none of which is outstanding  and  shares have been designated series b preferred  of which  shares remained outstanding as of december  subject to the prior consent of the holders of the series b preferred stock  our board of directors can fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such preferred stock without any further vote or action by its stockholders 
however  the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders 
as a result  the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock may be adversely affected 
the issuance of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
other provisions in our charter documents with respect to undesignated preferred stock may discourage potential acquisition bids for informix and prevent changes in our management which its stockholders may favor 
other provisions in our charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction that our stockholders may favor 
the provisions include elimination of the right of stockholders to act without holding a meeting  certain procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings  and a board of directors divided into three classes  with each class standing for election once every three years 
these provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the board of directors and in the policies formulated by the board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or threatened change of control 
these provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and  accordingly  could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control 
such provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights but could  however  have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for shares of our common stock  and consequently  may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management 
in addition  we have adopted a rights agreement  commonly referred to as a poison pill  that grants holders of our common stock preferential rights in the event of an unsolicited takeover attempt 
these rights are denied to any stockholder involved in the takeover attempt and this has the effect of requiring cooperation with our board of directors 
this may also prevent an increase in the market price of our common stock resulting from actual or rumored takeover attempts 
the rights agreement could also discourage potential acquirors from making unsolicited acquisition bids 
delaware law may inhibit potential acquisition bids which may adversely affect the market price for informix common stock and prevent changes in its management that its stockholders may favor 
informix is incorporated in delaware and is subject to the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
delaware law prevents certain delaware corporations  including those corporations  such as informix  whose securities are listed for trading on the nasdaq national market  from engaging  under certain circumstances  in a business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
for purposes of delaware law  a business combination would include  among other things  a merger or consolidation involving informix and an interested stockholder and the sale of more than of informix s assets 
in general  delaware law defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person 
under delaware law  a delaware corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions 
informix does not intend to opt out of these antitakeover provisions of delaware law 
our common stock likely will be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations which may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above the price at which they purchased their shares 
fluctuations in the price and trading volume of our common stock may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares above the price at which they purchased their shares 
stock prices and trading volumes for many software companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons  including some reasons which may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations 
this market volatility  as well as general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions  could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the market price of our common stock would likely decrease significantly 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly because of market uncertainty about the company s business prospects or the prospects for the rdbms ordbms markets in general  revenues or results of operations that do not match analysts expectations  the introduction of new products or product enhancements by informix or its competitors  general business conditions in the software industry  changes in the mix of revenues attributable to domestic and international sales  and seasonal trends in technology purchases and other general economic conditions
