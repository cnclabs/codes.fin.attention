the company s exposure to product liability claims is discussed in the note entitled commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report 
future results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may be affected to the extent that the company s ultimate exposure with respect to product liability varies from current estimates 
outlook this outlook section and other parts of this management s discussion and analysis contain forward looking information and involve certain risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results 
certain important factors that  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s results of operations and that could cause such future results of operations to differ are described in cautionary statements pursuant to the securities litigation reform act which is an exhibit to this report 
as an industry leader  the company is positioned to capitalize on the challenging but opportunity rich marketplace in fiscal the global equipment rental business is expected to continue its robust growth  leading to additional economies of scale and broadened end user awareness that should further expand the demand for the company s products 
management expects to grow sales not only through market share gains  but also through pull through marketing initiatives designed to increase demand for the company s products 
demand for the company s equipment is anticipated to remain strong in fiscal domestic demand for excavators should benefit from anticipated increases in federal highway spending 
similarly  management expects sales of material handlers to grow through greater penetration at the major rental companies  new product introductions and increased demand from end users for the company s brand 
additionally  the rapid growth of awp usage in europe is anticipated to continue into fiscal  leading to continuing growth in the company s overseas markets 
the company also expects to introduce a substantial number of new products in fiscal the company also expects to continue to reduce costs and to increase cash flow as management continues to enhance gradall s operations and improve its capacity utilization and manufacturing processes 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these risks principally through its regular operating and financing activities 
while the company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of its outstanding debt  the company does not currently utilize any derivative financial instruments related to its interest rate exposure 
total short term and long term debt outstanding at july  was million  consisting of million in variable rate borrowing and million in fixed rate borrowing 
at this level of variable rate borrowing  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease pre tax current year earnings by approximately  at july  a hypothetical change in interest rates would not result in a material change in the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and sells these products in that market as well as international markets  principally europe and australia 
as a result of the sales of its products in foreign markets  the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar  as compared to foreign currencies resulting from transactions in foreign markets 
at july   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s transactions are denominated would have the result of reducing gross profits for the year ended july  by approximately million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices
