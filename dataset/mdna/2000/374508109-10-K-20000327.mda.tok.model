these matters include soil and water contamination  air pollution and personal injuries or property damage allegedly caused by substances manufactured  handled  used  released or disposed of by the company 
future expenditures related to health and environmental matters cannot be reasonably quantified in many circumstances for various reasons  including the speculative nature of remediation and cleanup cost estimates and methods  imprecise and conflicting data regarding the hazardous nature of various types of substances  the number of other potentially responsible parties involved  various defenses which may be available to the company and changing environmental laws and interpretations of environmental laws 
rules and regulations implementing federal  state and local laws relating to health and the environment will continue to affect the operations of the company 
the company cannot predict what health or environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or enforced with respect to products or activities of the company 
compliance with more stringent laws or regulations  as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies  could have an adverse effect on the financial position and the results of operations of the company and could require substantial expenditures by the company for the installation and operation of refinery equipment  pollution control systems and other equipment not currently possessed by the company 
on october   the state of new mexico filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of new mexico  and a separate lawsuit in the second judicial district court  county of bernalillo  state of new mexico  against numerous entities  including general electric company  acf industries  inc  chevron corporation  texaco refining and marketing  inc  phillips petroleum company  ultramar diamond shamrock corporation  the united states department of energy  the united states department of defense  the united states air force and the company 
the lawsuits relate to alleged releases of pollutants at the south valley cercla superfund site in albuquerque  new mexico 
the south valley superfund site includes contamination that allegedly originated from a number of facilities  including a ge aircraft engines us air force facility and the albuquerque terminal  which was acquired by the company in from texaco 
the lawsuits allege that the defendants released or threatened to release hazardous substances into the environment  causing injury to surface water  groundwater and soil at the south valley superfund site  which are natural resources of the state 
in the federal court lawsuit  the state seeks monetary damages under cercla for all past  present and future damages to these natural resources  plus interest  costs and attorneys fees 
the state court complaint contains state law claims for trespass  public nuisance  interference with natural resources held in trust by the state  negligence  strict liability  unjust enrichment and punitive damages 
the state seeks various monetary damages in connection with these claims  including natural resources damages  loss of use of property and natural resources  loss of tax revenues  lost profits  punitive damages and attorneys fees and costs 
since its original filing  the state court complaint has been removed to federal court 
the company  along with certain other defendants  has filed a motion to dismiss the state claims 
although neither complaint calculates the amount of damages being sought by the state  a preliminary assessment report on alleged damages to natural resources  dated december  issued by the new mexico office of the natural resources trustee estimated these damages at  liability for natural resource damages under cercla is joint and several such that a responsible party may be liable for all natural resource damages at a site even though it was responsible for only a small part of such damages 
texaco agreed to defend  indemnify  reimburse and hold the company harmless from and against all claims and damages arising from  or caused by  pre closing contamination at the albuquerque terminal 
texaco has acknowledged this obligation  subject to any evidence that alleged releases resulted from the company s operations 
the company believes that any damages associated with the south valley superfund site relate to releases that predate the company s acquisition of the albuquerque terminal and  accordingly  does not believe that it needs to record a liability in connection with the two lawsuits 
in  the company constructed the farmington refinery that was operated until the company became aware of soil and shallow groundwater contamination at this facility in the company hired environmental consulting firms to investigate the contamination and undertake remedial action 
the consultants identified several areas of contamination in the soils and shallow groundwater underlying the farmington property 
a consultant to the company has indicated that contamination attributable to past operations at the farmington property has migrated off the refinery property  including a hydrocarbon plume that appears to extend no more than  feet south of the refinery property 
remediation activities are ongoing by the company under ocd s supervision  although no cleanup order has been received 
the company had reserved approximately  for possible environmental expenditures relating to its farmington property  of which approximately  still remains 
the farmington property is located adjacent to the lee acres landfill  a closed landfill formerly operated by san juan county  which is situated on lands owned by blm 
industrial and municipal wastes were disposed of in the landfill by numerous sources 
during the period that it was operational  the company disposed of office trash  maintenance shop trash  used tires and water from the farmington refinery s evaporation pond at the landfill 
the landfill was added to the national priorities list as a cercla superfund site in in connection with this listing  epa defined the site as the landfill and the landfill s associated groundwater plume 
epa excluded any releases from the farmington refinery itself from the definition of the site 
in may  epa notified the company that it may be a potentially responsible party under cercla for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances  pollutants or contaminants at the landfill 
blm made a proposed plan of action for the landfill available to the public in remediation alternatives examined by blm in connection with the development of its proposed plan ranged in projected cost from no cost to approximately  blm proposed the adoption of a remedial action alternative that it believes would cost approximately  to implement 
blm s  cost estimate is based on certain assumptions which may or may not prove to be correct and is contingent on confirmation that the remedial actions  once implemented  are adequately addressing landfill contamination 
for example  if assumptions regarding groundwater mobility and contamination levels are incorrect  blm is proposing to take additional remedial actions with an estimated cost of approximately  blm has received public comment on its proposed plan 
the final remedy for the site  however  has not yet been selected 
it is anticipated that the final remedy will be selected in in  a consultant to the company estimated  based on various assumptions  that the company s share of potential liability could be approximately  this figure was based upon estimated landfill remediation costs significantly higher than those being proposed by blm 
the figure was also based on the consultant s evaluation of such factors as available clean up technology  blm s involvement at the site and the number of other entities that may have had involvement at the site  but did not include an analysis of all of the company s potential legal defenses and arguments  including possible setoff rights 
potentially responsible party liability is joint and several  such that a responsible party may be liable for all of the clean up costs at a site even though the party was responsible for only a small part of such costs 
although it is possible that the company may ultimately incur liability for clean up costs associated with the landfill  a reasonable estimate of the amount of this liability  if any  cannot be made at this time because  among other reasons  the final site remedy has not been selected  a number of entities had involvement at the site  allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties has not yet been made  and potentially applicable factual and legal issues have not been resolved 
based on current information  the company does not believe that it needs to record a liability in relation to blm s proposed plan 
blm may assert claims against the company and others for reimbursement of investigative  cleanup and other costs incurred by blm in connection with the landfill and surrounding areas 
it is also possible that the company will assert claims against blm in connection with contamination that may be originating from the landfill 
private parties and other governmental entities may also assert claims against blm  the company and others for property damage  personal injury and other damages allegedly arising out of any contamination originating from the landfill and the farmington property 
parties may also request judicial determination of their rights and responsibilities  and the rights and responsibilities of others  in connection with the landfill and the farmington property 
currently  however  there is no outstanding litigation against the company by blm or any other party 
in connection with the acquisition of the bloomfield refinery  the company assumed certain environmental obligations including bloomfield refining company s obligations under an administrative order issued by epa in pursuant to the resources conservation and recovery act 
the order required brc to investigate and propose measures for correcting any releases of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents at or from the bloomfield refinery 
the company established an environmental reserve of  in connection with this matter  of which approximately  still remains 
the company has discovered hydrocarbon contamination adjacent to a  barrel crude oil storage tank that was located in bloomfield  new mexico 
the company believes that all or a portion of the tank and the acres owned by the company on which the tank was located may have been a part of a refinery  owned by various other parties  that  to the company s knowledge  ceased operations in the early s 
the company submitted a work plan to define the extent of petroleum contamination in the soil and groundwater  which was approved by ocd subject to certain conditions 
one of the conditions required the company to submit a comprehensive report on all site investigations to ocd by january  the company filed the required report on january  based upon the report  it appears possible that contaminated groundwater is contained within the property boundaries and does not extend offsite 
it is anticipated that ocd will not require remediation of offsite soil based upon the low contaminant levels found there 
the company previously estimated cleanup costs at  and an environmental reserve in that amount was created  of which  remains 
if ocd adopts the remediation alternative proposed by the company  the company anticipates that the cost of remediation will be closer to  the company  however  does not know whether ocd will adopt the company s remediation proposal 
the company is in receipt of a nov  dated february   from nmed alleging that the company failed to comply with certain notification requirements contained in one of the permits applicable to the ciniza refinery s land treatment facility 
as a result  the company and nmed are negotiating a plan for closure of the land treatment facility 
it is anticipated that the costs associated with implementing the type of closure plan under discussion would be approximately  an estimated  of this amount would be spent in  with the remainder spent over a period of approximately years 
the company has an environmental liability accrual of approximately  approximately  relates to ongoing environmental projects  including the remediation of a hydrocarbon plume that appears to extend no more than  feet south of the inactive farmington refinery and hydrocarbon contamination on and adjacent to the acres that the company owns in bloomfield  new mexico 
the remaining  relates to certain environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of the bloomfield refinery 
this environmental accrual is recorded in the current and long term sections of the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company is subject to audit on an ongoing basis of the various taxes that it pays to federal  state  local and tribal governments 
these audits may result in assessments or refunds along with interest and penalties 
in some cases the jurisdictional basis of the taxing authority is in dispute and is the subject of litigation or administrative appeals 
the company has received several tax notifications and assessments from the navajo tribe relating to company operations outside the boundaries of the navajo indian reservation in an area of disputed jurisdiction  including a  severance tax assessment including interest and penalties through the date of the assessment issued in november  and a  severance tax assessment including interest and penalties through the date of the assessment issued in may  both of which relate to crude oil removed from properties located within this area 
the company has invoked its appeal rights with the tribe s tax commission in connection with the assessments and intends to oppose the assessments 
although it is probable that the company will incur liability in connection with tax notifications and assessments from the navajo tribe relating to the area of disputed jurisdiction  it is not possible to precisely estimate the amount of any obligation for such taxes at this time because the navajo tribe s legal authority to impose taxes throughout this area has not been legally established and all potentially applicable factual issues have not been resolved 
the company has accrued a liability for assessments that it has received from the navajo tribe for substantially less than the amount of the assessments 
it is possible that the company s assessments will have to be litigated by the company before final resolution 
in addition  the company may receive further tax assessments 
the company may potentially be able to request reimbursement from third party oil lease interest owners in connection with any severance tax amounts ultimately paid by the company that relate to purchases from the interest owners 
the company intends to continue purchasing activities in the area of disputed jurisdiction 
the company s current receipts and projections of four corners crude oil production indicate that the company s crude oil demand may periodically exceed the supply of crude oil that is available from local sources 
the company has  and may from time to time  decrease production runs at its refineries from levels it would otherwise schedule as a result of shortfalls in four corners crude oil production 
the four corners basin is a mature production area and  accordingly  is subject to a natural decline in production over time 
in the past  this natural decline has been offset by new drilling  field workovers and secondary recovery projects which resulted in additional production from existing reserves 
many of these projects were cut back  however  when crude oil prices declined dramatically in based upon history and discussions with local producers  the company anticipates that additional projects will again be undertaken and that production will increase from the field as a result of the recovery in crude oil prices which began in the second quarter of through the first quarter of  the company has noticed an increase in four corners production and has indications that producers are considering projects that  if undertaken  could increase production significantly by the end of or early the company estimates that for the year its refinery production runs will approximate levels based on current receipts and projections of four corners crude oil production 
if additional crude oil or other refinery feedstocks become available  the company may increase its production runs depending on demand for finished products and refining margins attainable 
the company supplements the four corners crude oil used at its refineries with other feedstocks 
these feedstocks currently include locally produced natural gas liquids and other feedstocks produced outside of the four corners area 
the company continues to evaluate supplemental feedstock alternatives for its refineries on both a short term and long term basis 
these alternatives include  among other possibilities  the encouraging of new exploration and production opportunities on tribal reservation lands 
in addition  the company may evaluate a project to increase its production of gasoline from abundantly available natural gas liquids 
whether or not supplemental feedstocks are used at the company s refineries depends on a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the availability of supplemental feedstocks  the cost involved  the quantities required  the quality of the feedstocks  the demand for finished products  and the selling prices of finished products 
there is no assurance that current or projected levels of four corners crude oil supply for the company s refineries will be maintained 
any significant long term interruption or decline in four corners crude oil supply  due to prices or other factors  or any significant long term interruption of crude oil transportation systems  would have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company is aware of a number of actions  proposals or industry discussions regarding product pipeline projects that could impact portions of its marketing areas 
one of these projects is the potential conversion and extension of the existing texas new mexico crude oil pipeline to transport refined products from west texas to new mexico  including albuquerque and potentially bloomfield 
another potential project would take product on to salt lake city  utah 
in addition  various actions have been undertaken to increase the supply of refined products to el paso  texas  which is connected by pipeline to the albuquerque area to the north and the phoenix and tucson  arizona markets to the west 
the completion of some or all of these projects would result in increased competition by increasing the amount of refined products potentially available in these markets  as well as improving competitor access to these areas  and may result in new opportunities for the company  as the company is a net purchaser of refined products in some of these areas 
separately  at the end of  an existing natural gas liquids pipeline had been converted to a refined products pipeline and was delivering finished product from southeastern new mexico to the albuquerque and four corners areas 
the company expects increased competition for sales volumes in these areas as a result of the completion of this project 
the company is subject to various federal and state programs relating to the composition of motor fuels 
in december  epa issued a rule which requires refiners to reduce the sulfur content of gasoline to ppm by unless they qualify for an extension of this deadline 
the company may be eligible for an extension of up to one year under a provision pertaining to gasoline produced or sold in certain designated geographic areas  including three states in which the company markets its gasoline 
it is anticipated that the company will incur costs in the approximate amount of  to purchase the equipment necessary to produce gasoline with a ppm sulfur content at its refineries 
the federal clean air act requires the sale of reformulated gasoline in certain designated areas of the country 
motor fuels produced by the company s refineries are not sold in any such areas 
arizona  however  has adopted a cleaner burning gasoline program 
the company does not presently manufacture gasolines that satisfy arizona cbg specifications 
the specifications are currently applicable to gasolines sold or used in maricopa county and a portion of yavapai county  and are expected to become effective in pinal county by the company operates approximately service stations in these areas  and also conducts wholesale marketing operations there 
the company currently does not intend to make the changes necessary to produce cbg because the capital costs associated with manufacturing large quantities of such gasolines would be significant in amounts not determined by the company 
the company has the ability to purchase or exchange for these gasolines to supply its operations in the cbg areas  including pinal county 
it is possible that additional legislation or regulations affecting motor fuel specifications may be adopted that would impact geographic areas in which the company markets its products 
in  the company outlined a program for year yk compliance 
the yk issue is the result of certain computer systems using a two digit format rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
such computer systems may be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the year  which could lead to system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
the company identified three major areas determined to be critical for successful yk compliance financial and information system applications  manufacturing and process applications  including embedded chips  and business relationships 
the company hired an outside consultant to act as its year project manager 
this consultant directed the company s efforts in identifying and resolving yk issues pursuant to a five phase program for year compliance 
awareness phase 
this phase included the development of a project management plan to make the company aware of the yk problem  identify potential yk issues in all areas of the company and develop a plan of action to resolve these issues 
this phase was completed in july assessment phase 
completed in october  this phase included generating a complete inventory of all software  hardware  processing equipment and embedded chips throughout the entire organization and identifying those items that were yk compliant and those that were not 
renovation remedy phase 
in this phase  strategies were developed for each item inventoried during the assessment phase to determine whether remedial action was required and  if so  whether the item should be eliminated  replaced  or updated 
this phase also included the determination of priorities and scheduling  including contingency plans for all critical items 
this phase was substantially completed in february except for phoenix fuel and the company s retail operations  which were completed in june validation testing phase 
in this phase  a test plan was developed and implemented to validate the remedies selected in the previous phase 
the company completed testing in september implementation phase 
this phase involved the use of the yk compliant inventory  and the development and implementation of additional plans to avoid yk problems 
the company completed this phase in september remediation of the yk items identified by the company was accomplished using both internal and external manpower 
the total cost of the yk project was approximately  the company funded its yk expenditures from operating cash flows 
the company experienced no significant disruptions to its business operations as a result of yk issues 
the company is not aware of any significant yk problems affecting critical business partners
