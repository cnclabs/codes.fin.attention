all information stated herein has been revised to reflect the stock for stock transactions  accounted for as poolings of interests  with henry s and sun harvest  which were consummated on september  and december   respectively 
the company declared a for stock split for all stockholders of record on november   effective december  all shares and per share information presented herein have been retroactively restated to reflect this stock split 
overview store openings  closings  remodels  relocations and acquisitions 
in  we opened eight new stores in phoenix  arizona  san diego  california opened by henry s  evanston and hinsdale  illinois  madison  new jersey  albuquerque  new mexico  tulsa  oklahoma and nashville  tennessee  and relocated five stores in phoenix  arizona  ft 
collins  colorado  portland  oregon  salt lake city  utah and memphis  tennessee 
as of march   we have opened three new stores and relocated one new store 
also during  we acquired operating natural foods stores  including seven nature s fresh northwest stores in metropolitan portland  oregon of which one was subsequently relocated during the second quarter  four in metropolitan boston  massachusetts  three in tucson  arizona  two in norwalk and hartford  connecticut  and one in melbourne  florida 
we also consummated two stock for stock transactions  accounted for as poolings of interest  which added stores to our historic store base  including henry s marketplace stores in metropolitan san diego  california one of which was opened in and is included in the number of new stores opened discussed herein and nine sun harvest and four vitamin stores in san antonio  austin and other texas communities 
we plan to open  acquire or relocate as many as stores in the remainder of we are actively looking for other acquisition opportunities and may complete additional acquisitions in we will continue to evaluate the profitability of all of our stores on an ongoing basis and may  from time to time  make decisions regarding closures  disposals  relocations or remodels in accordance with such evaluations 
as a result of such evaluations  we closed two farm to market stores in tempe  arizona and buffalo grove  illinois in in the first quarter of  we closed our dallas store for remodeling and reopening under the sun harvest tradename  and closed two of our smaller stores 
during the first half of  we plan to remodel as many as of our existing  older stores to remerchandise and incorporate new features 
acquisitions 
in  we opened eight new stores including one opened by henry s and acquired stores  including o nature s fresh northwest  located in metropolitan portland  oregon  which owned seven operating natural foods stores and one site in development 
nature s had sales of approximately million in the purchase price was approximately million in cash and assumption by us of a million promissory note payable to the seller 
this acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method and the excess of cost over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of million was allocated to goodwill  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
o four stores operated under the name wild harvest in metropolitan boston  massachusetts 
the purchase price aggregated million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method  and the excess of cost over the fair value of the assets acquired of  was allocated to goodwill  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
we also consummated two stock for stock transactions  accounted for as poolings of interest  which added natural food grocery stores and four small vitamin stores to our historic store base  with the following entities o henry s marketplace  located in metropolitan san diego  california  which owned operating natural foods stores and one site in development 
henry s had sales of approximately million in the merger consideration was  shares of wild oats common stock 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
o sun harvest farms and an affiliate  located in san antonio  austin and other texas communities  which owned nine operating natural food stores and four vitamin stores 
sun harvest farms had sales of approximately million in sales in the merger consideration was  shares of wild oats common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
our results of operations have been and will continue to be affected by  among other things  the number  timing and mix of store openings  acquisitions  relocations or closings 
new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection gradually and  as a result  generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than more mature stores 
we anticipate that the new stores opened in will experience operating losses for the first six to months of operation  in accordance with historical trends 
further  acquired stores  while generally profitable as of the acquisition date  generate lower gross margins and store contribution margins than our company average due to their substantially lower volume purchasing discounts 
over time  typically six months  as we sell through the acquired inventories and are able to realize our volume purchase discounts  we expect that the gross margin and store contribution margin of the acquired stores will approach our company average 
we anticipate that our current high concentration of acquired stores  including the nature s  henry s and sun harvest stores  will have a temporary negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 
we are actively upgrading  remodeling or relocating some of our older stores 
we plan to remodel or remerchandise as many as of our older stores in the first half of remodels and relocations typically cause short term disruption in sales volume and related increases in certain expenses as a percentage of sales  such as payroll 
remodels on average take between and days to complete 
we cannot predict whether sales disruptions and the related impact on earnings may be greater in time or volume than projected in certain remodeled or relocated stores 
store format and clustering strategy 
we operate two store formats supermarket and urban 
the supermarket format is generally  to  gross square feet  and typically generates higher sales and store contribution than the urban format stores  which are generally  to  gross square feet 
our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by the mix of supermarket and urban format stores opened  acquired or relocated and whether stores are being opened in markets where we have an existing presence 
we expect to focus primarily on opening  acquiring or relocating supermarket format stores in the future but will consider additional urban stores when appropriate opportunities arise 
in addition  we pursue a strategy of clustering stores in each of our markets to increase overall sales  reduce operating costs and increase customer awareness 
in the past  when we have opened a store in a market where we have an existing presence  our sales and operating results have declined at certain of our existing stores in that market 
however  over time  we believe the affected stores generally will achieve store contribution margins comparable to prior levels on the lower base of sales 
we intend to continue to pursue our store clustering strategy and expect the sales and operating results trends for other stores in an expanded market to continue to experience temporary declines related to the clustering of stores 
comparable store sales results 
sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the thirteenth full month of operations for new  relocated and acquired stores 
a variety of factors affect our comparable store sales results  including  among others o the opening of stores by us or by our competitors in markets where we have existing stores o the relative proportion of new or relocated stores to mature stores o the timing of promotional events o store remodels o our ability to execute our operating plans effectively o changes in consumer preferences for natural foods products o general economic conditions 
past increases in comparable store sales may not be indicative of future performance 
our comparable store sales results have been negatively affected in the past by planned cannibalization  which is the loss of sales at an existing store when we open a new store nearby  resulting from the implementation of our store clustering strategy 
we expect that comparable sales increases will continue to be negatively affected in by planned cannibalization due to the opening of new or relocated stores in several of our existing markets  including  among others  phoenix  arizona  san diego  california  kansas city and st 
louis  missouri  las vegas  nevada  albuquerque  new mexico and salt lake city  utah 
as a result  we expect comparable store sales percentage increases to be flat to slightly negative for the first quarter of  and to average in the low to mid single digits for the remainder of there can be no assurance that comparable store sales for any particular period will not decrease in the future 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses include labor  rent  utilities  supplies and certain other costs incurred prior to a store s opening 
pre opening expenses have averaged approximately  to  per store historically  although the amount per store may vary depending on the store format and whether the store is the first to be opened in a market  or is part of a cluster of stores in that market 
in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for costs of start up activities 
statement of position requires that pre opening costs be expensed as incurred 
statement of position is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and the initial application should be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we adopted statement of position in fiscal and recorded approximately  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of taxes  during results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  certain selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of sales fiscal year ended sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit direct store expenses store contribution selling  general and administrative expenses pre opening expenses non recurring expenses income from operations interest expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal contained weeks of operations as compared to weeks in fiscal sales sales for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million from million in the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of seventeen stores  the opening of eight new stores  and the relocation of five stores  as well as the inclusion of a full year of sales for the nine new stores opened and seven stores acquired in comparable store sales increased for  as compared to for gross profit gross profit for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million from million in the increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to the acquisition of seventeen stores and the opening of eight new stores

direct store expenses direct store expenses for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million from million in the increase in direct store expenses is attributable to the increase in the number of stores operated by the company

in addition  the company moved its corporate office during the fourth quarter of to a larger facility to accommodate an increased support staff for its larger base of stores 
there is a full year of additional selling  general and administrative expenses for rent and utilities on the new facility in  as compared to one quarter in pre opening expenses as previously discussed herein  in april  the aicpa issued sop  accounting for the costs of start up activities 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses for the fiscal year ended january   decreased to million from million in the decrease in pre opening expenses is attributable to the decrease in the number of stores opened 
as a percentage of sales  pre opening expenses decreased to from due to the opening of eight new stores in as compared to nine new stores in non recurring expenses non recurring expenses for the fiscal year ended january   were million  as compared to  in non recurring expenses of approximately million were recorded in the first quarter of as the result of certain decisions by our management regarding our operations and selected store closures 
the first decision was a change in our strategic direction with respect to our two farm to market stores located in buffalo grove  illinois  and tempe  arizona which resulted in a non recurring expense of million 
the second decision involved the reallocation of corporate resources to service new and existing stores  rather than closed sites which resulted in a non recurring expense of million 
components of the non recurring charge consist primarily of non cancelable lease obligations through the year in the amount of million and abandonment of fixed and intangible assets in the amount of million 
there were also non recurring expenses of  during the third quarter of  and million during the fourth quarter  as a result of the poolings with henry s and sun harvest 
the components were primarily non cancelable lease obligations and professional fees 
the charge is attributed to employee severance costs  inventory and fixed asset write downs  and lease cancellation costs associated with two poolings of interests transactions during interest expense  net net interest expense for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million  from  in as a percentage of sales  net interest expense increased to from less than in the increase is primarily attributable to interest on borrowings on our line of credit to fund acquisitions and new stores 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal contained weeks of operations as compared to weeks in fiscal sales sales for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million from million in the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of seven stores  the opening of nine new stores  and the relocation of two stores  as well as the inclusion of a full year of sales for the five new stores opened and nine stores acquired in comparable store sales increased for  as compared to for gross profit gross profit for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million from million in the increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to the acquisition of seven stores and the opening of nine new stores 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to in from in due to the maturation of the company s store base and the company s increasing volume purchase discounts 
direct store expenses direct store expenses for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million from million in the increase in direct store expenses is attributable to the increase in the number of stores operated by the company 
as a percentage of sales  direct store expenses decreased to from in due to the matured performance of the new stores opened in  as well as improved control of direct store expenses  particularly payroll and benefits costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million from million in as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to from in the increases are the result of additional personnel costs in the information technology  marketing and purchasing departments needed to support our growth plans  as well as additional costs to distribute marketing materials to our customers 
in addition  we moved our corporate office during the fourth quarter of to a larger facility to accommodate an increased support staff for our larger base of stores 
there were additional selling  general and administrative expenses for rent and utilities on the new facility  as well as costs of relocating the information systems that we use 
pre opening expenses pre opening expenses for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million from million in the increase in pre opening expenses is attributable to the increase in the number of stores opened or relocated 
as a percentage of sales  pre opening expenses increased to from due to the delayed opening of two stores resulting in additional pre opening costs primarily in the form of rental payments  as well as the opening of nine new stores in as compared to five new stores in non recurring expenses non recurring expenses for the fiscal year ended january   were  as compared to no non recurring expenses in the change is attributed to employee severance costs  inventory and fixed asset write downs  and lease cancellation costs associated with two poolings of interests transactions during interest expense  net net interest expense for the fiscal year ended january   decreased to  from  in as a percentage of sales  net interest expense decreased to less than from in the decrease is attributable to the investment of the net proceeds from the company s public equity offering in december and to lower levels of indebtedness incurred to fund new store openings and acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have been cash flow from operations  trade payables  bank indebtedness  and the sale of equity securities 
primary uses of cash have been the financing of new store development  new store openings  relocations  remodels  acquisitions and purchases of real property 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during as compared to million during cash provided by operating activities increased during this period primarily due to increases in net income before depreciation and amortization expense and non recurring expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during and million during cash provided by operating activities increased during this period primarily as a result of an increase in net income before depreciation and amortization expense and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
we have not required significant external financing to support inventory requirements at our existing and new stores because we have been able to rely on vendor financing for most of the inventory costs  and we anticipate that vendor financing will continue to be available for new store openings 
net cash used by investing activities was million during as compared to million during the same period in the increase is due to the opening of eight new stores  the acquisition of stores  the relocation of five stores and several store remodels in  as compared to nine new stores  one relocated store and seven acquired stores in and the construction costs incurred for new stores in development which opened during net cash used by investing activities was million during due to the acquisition of nine stores and the opening of five new stores during  the purchase of real property and the construction costs incurred for six new stores in development which opened during the first nine months of net cash provided by financing activities was million during as compared to million net cash used during the increase reflects increased borrowing under our revolving line of credit  as well as repayment of a million debt 
net cash used by financing activities was million during and net cash provided by financing activities was million during the fluctuation was primarily due to net proceeds of million from the sale of million shares of our common stock pursuant to a public equity offering in december we have a million revolving credit facility 
the facility has two separate lines of credit  one in the amount of million with a three year term expiring in and the other in the amount of million with a one year term  expiring in may both bear interest  at our option  at the prime rate or libor plus 
the line of credit agreement includes certain financial and other covenants  as well as restrictions on payments of dividends 
as of december   there were million in borrowings outstanding under the million line of this facility and million in borrowings outstanding under the million line 
we are currently negotiating with our bank group to increase the commitment under the revolving credit facility to million 
we spent approximately million during for new store construction  purchases of real property and leasehold interests  development  remodels and maintenance capital expenditures  exclusive of acquisitions  and anticipate that we will spend to million in for new store construction  equipment  leasehold improvements  remodels and maintenance capital expenditures  relocations of existing stores and purchases of leasehold interests  exclusive of acquisitions 
our average capital expenditures to open a leased store  including leasehold improvements  equipment and fixtures  have ranged from approximately million to million historically  excluding inventory costs and initial operating losses 
delays in opening new stores may result in increased capital expenditures  increased pre opening costs and lower sales 
we opened two stores on owned property in the second quarter of  acquired a third operating store and the underlying property in the second quarter of as part of the acquisition of the outstanding stock of nature s fresh northwest and acquired an office building in the fourth quarter of as part of the pooling of interests transaction with sun harvest farms  inc acquisition of real property and construction of stores requires substantially greater cash outlays than the remodeling of existing leased buildings ie  to million as compared to to million 
we sold three parcels in sale leaseback transactions and plan to sell the office building and a remaining vacant parcel in sale transactions 
the cost of initial inventory for a new store has historically been approximately  to  however  we obtain vendor financing for most of this cost 
pre opening costs currently are approximately  to  per store and are expensed as incurred 
the amounts and timing of such pre opening costs will depend upon the availability of new store sites and other factors  including the location of the store and whether it is in a new or existing market for us  the size of the store  and the required build out at the site 
costs to acquire future stores  if any  are impossible to predict and could vary materially from the cost to open new stores 
there can be no assurance that actual capital expenditures will not exceed anticipated levels 
we believe that cash generated from operations and funds available under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  exclusive of additional acquisitions  through new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
fas no 
also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
in june  the fasb issued fas no 
which defers the effective date of fas no 
to fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt fas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal  but does not expect such adoption to materially affect financial statement presentation 
year readiness statement information technologies 
we recognize the need to ensure that our operations will not be adversely affected by year software or hardware failures that may occur through the first half of the year we have determined that all components of our major software and hardware systems at our corporate headquarters are year compliant  and as of the date of this report  we have experienced no material disruptions in operations of such systems 
all but two of our stores contain point of sale systems  such as cash registers and scanners  that are also year compliant  including those recently acquired or added through stock for stock transactions in total replacement and installation cost to date has been approximately million 
the financial impact to us of further investments is not anticipated to be material 
vendors  suppliers and service providers 
we have received confirmation from a majority of our major suppliers  service providers  and financial institutions that they are year compliant 
we experienced no material disruptions as of january  in product supplies 
many of our product vendors are smaller businesses that have not considered the impact of year noncompliance and therefore have not taken steps to ensure compliance 
to the extent that product vendors manufacturing or distribution systems fail as a result of year noncompliance  certain products carried by our stores could become unavailable  resulting in decreases in operating revenues  although in many circumstances alternative local vendors products may be available 
one of our largest distributors has upgraded or replaced the majority of its technology infrastructure and devices that had embedded computer chips with compliant systems and devices 
at this time  we cannot evaluate the magnitude of the impact that a failure by that distributor to successfully install compliant systems could have on our operations 
a failure in the distributor s warehouse facilities could affect our ability to stock product in certain of our stores  resulting in lower sales revenues in those stores 
there were no major failures in the operating systems of our financial institutions as of january  if our financial institutions are not year compliant  a failure in their operating system could result in our temporary inability to access necessary cash resources required for operations  we expect that normal store operations  however  will generate sufficient revenues to cover daily operating needs 
our credit card processor has confirmed to us that it has adapted its systems to accept credit cards issued with expiration dates of and beyond and has also completed implementation of all phases of its compliance program in accordance with guidelines of the federal financial institutions examination council and to date there have been no disruptions in credit card processing 
mechanical systems 
there was little impact on store operations due to year noncompliance in mechanical systems as of january  we do not anticipate that any major store mechanical systems will require replacement because of year compliance concerns or that noncompliance of any mechanical systems will have any material effect on store operations 
the dollar value of perishable goods that could be affected by a failure in refrigerated systems is small in comparison to the total inventory of any one store 
the estimates and conclusions regarding year impact contained above are forward looking statements based on our best estimates of future events 
actual results may differ due to certain risks and uncertainties that we cannot  at this time  predict
