psa weekly sales for comparable restaurants increased in  in and in compared to the respective prior year  due to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amounts 
we believe restaurant sales improvements result from our two tier marketing strategy featuring both premium sandwiches and value priced alternatives  as well as to a popular brand building advertising campaign that features our fictional founder  jack 
also contributing to sales growth were our strategic initiatives  including an assemble to order ato program in which sandwiches are made when customers order them  menu boards that showcase combo meals and an order confirmation system at the drive thru

in  we reduced accrued liabilities and restaurant operating costs by million  primarily due to a change in estimates resulting from improvements to our loss prevention and risk management programs  which have been more successful than anticipated 
this change in estimates was supported by an independent actuarial study conducted to evaluate the self insured portion of our workers compensation  general liability and other insurance programs 
restaurant operating costs were of restaurant sales in  in  excluding the change in estimates  and in the percentage in increased compared to primarily reflecting costs related to initiatives designed to improve the overall guest experience and slightly higher labor related costs 
the restaurant operating costs percentage declined in compared to  reflecting improved rates of labor related costs and occupancy expenses  which increased at lesser rates than psa sales growth

in  such costs included a non cash charge of approximately million  primarily related to facilities and customer service improvement projects 
interest expense declined to million in from million in and million in  principally due to a reduction in total debt outstanding and lower interest rates 
over this three year period  total long term debt has been reduced by million and certain debt has been refinanced at lower rates 
the tax provisions reflect effective annual tax rates of  and of pre tax earnings in  and  respectively 
the favorable income tax rates in each year result from our ability to realize  as our profitability has improved  previously unrecognized tax benefits such as business tax credit  tax loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards 
also contributing to the effective rate decline in was our settlement with the us internal revenue service of a tax case related to the disposition in november of our interest in family restaurants  inc we recognized tax benefits of million primarily as a result of this settlement 
in  we incurred an extraordinary loss of million  less income tax benefits of million  on the early extinguishment of million each of senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
net earnings were million  or per diluted share in  million  or per diluted share  in and million  or per diluted share  in each year includes unusual items  which increased our net earnings 
in  we reached a final agreement with the us internal revenue service to settle a tax case as described above 
this settlement increased net earnings by million or 
per diluted share 
in  restaurant operating costs were reduced by million due to a change in estimates as described above 
this change in estimates increased net earnings by million  or 
per diluted share  net of income taxes 
in addition  included a rd week that contributed an extra million in net earnings  or 
per diluted share 
in  net earnings included approximately million  or 
per diluted share  net of income taxes  from the litigation settlement income offset by the aforementioned non cash charge  and the extraordinary loss of million  or 
per share 
excluding these unusual items  earnings increased to million or per diluted share in from million or per diluted share  in  which had increased from million  or per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased million to approximately million at october  from approximately million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
we expect to maintain low levels of cash and cash equivalents  reinvesting available cash flows from operations to develop new or enhance existing restaurants and to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
our working capital deficit decreased million to million at october  from million at october   principally due to a decline in income tax liabilities 
the company and the restaurant industry in general  maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories and vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
our revolving bank credit agreement provides for a credit facility expiring in of up to million  including letters of credit of up to million 
at october   we had borrowings of million and approximately million of availability under the agreement 
total debt outstanding has decreased million to million at october  from million at the beginning of fiscal year we are subject to a number of covenants under our various debt instruments including limitations on additional borrowings  capital expenditures  lease commitments and dividend payments  and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios  cash flows and net worth 
in september  the collateral securing the bank credit facility was released 
however  real and personal property previously held as collateral for the bank credit facility cannot be used to secure other indebtedness of the company 
in addition  certain of our real and personal property secure other indebtedness 
we require capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain  improve and refurbish existing restaurants  and for general operating purposes 
our primary sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations  the revolving bank credit facility  and the sale and leaseback of restaurant properties 
additional potential sources of liquidity include financing opportunities and the conversion of company operated restaurants to franchised restaurants 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that sufficient cash flows will be generated from operations so that  combined with available financing alternatives  we will be able to meet debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
although the amount of liability from claims and actions described in note of the consolidated financial statements cannot be determined with certainty  management believes the ultimate liability of such claims and actions should not materially affect our results of operations and liquidity 
on december   our board of directors authorized the purchase of our outstanding common stock in the open market for an aggregate amount not to exceed million 
at october   we had acquired  shares under this authorization for an aggregate cost of million 
seasonality our restaurant sales and profitability are subject to seasonal fluctuations and are traditionally higher during the spring and summer months because of factors such as increased travel and improved weather conditions which affect the public s dining habits 
future accounting changes in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement was amended by sfas which deferred the effective date to all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  is effective for our first quarter in the fiscal year ending september  and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  summarizing their views for applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
although we have determined that the adoption of sab should not have a material effect on our annual results of operations  it will impact the reporting of our franchise percentage rent between quarters within the year 
as permitted by sab  we plan to adopt the new standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal year at which time we will restate the earlier quarters of the year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure relating to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
we use interest rate swap agreements to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
at october   we had a million notional amount interest rate swap agreement expiring in june this agreement effectively converts a portion of our variable rate bank debt to fixed rate debt and has a pay rate of 
our million credit facility bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin based on a financial leverage ratio 
as of october   our applicable margin was set at 
in fiscal year  the average interest rate paid on the credit facility was approximately 
at october   a hypothetical one percentage point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of 
million in annual pre tax earnings 
the estimated reduction is based on holding the unhedged portion of bank debt at its october  level 
at october   we had no other material financial instruments subject to significant market exposure
