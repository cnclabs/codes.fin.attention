revenues in fiscal year increased by or million over the previous years revenue reaching million compared to million in the pacific rim revenues totaled million  an increase  year on year  of million or while the revenues in north america totaling in the fiscal year  declined million or 
two projects in the philippines accounted for the majority of the pacific rim revenue growth while the north america revenues were negatively impacted by project delays 
see factors that may affect future results below 
the delays in projects that adversely impacted the north american revenues in should result in an improved revenue performance for the north american operations in fiscal gross profit gross profits totaling million decreased by million or in compared to those in of million 
the gross margins in were as a percentage of revenues while in the gross profit margin percentage was of revenues 
the decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to the project mix that comprised the revenue source in comparison to that of the prior year as a result of increasingly competitive bidding activity on new projects 
in addition  a reduction in the estimated contract revenues and therefore gross margins of million dollars was recorded this year when previously agreed to change orders were subsequently rejected by the owner of a project in thailand that was nearing completion 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses in of million were of revenues in comparison to of revenues in  during which time selling general and administrative expenses totaled million 
selling  general and administrative expenses were and of revenues respectively for the pacific rim and north america 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  million in the pacific rim and in north america  over the previous year or in total 
approximately million of the million increase in selling general and administrative expenses represents a reserve that was established as the result of uncertainties that developed in the third quarter in regards to the collectability of primarily million of retention receivables and cost in excess of billings and million in taxes and other costs on the empire towers project located in thailand 
in the third quarter  events the company believes were outside its control occurred on the empire towers project after which the owner of the building refused to honor claims previously agreed to and asserted claims against the company which the company believes are unsubstantiated 
management has met subsequently on several occasions with the building owner and the previous owner s specified supplier of the glass material of the project  to resolve the matters being alleged 
the company believes that allegations made by the building owner are the responsibility of a materials supplier and therefore is continuing to seek a favorable outcome to the dispute 
the remaining increase in selling general and administrative expenses of million representing a increase over the previous year was due to the building of the company s infrastructure  primarily in the pacific rim  in support of the pacific rim s revenue growth which was in fiscal income taxes income tax expense decreased from million in the fiscal year to a tax benefit of million in fiscal year the pretax loss in north america resulted in a tax reduction of million while the profitability of projects in the pacific rim segment  mainly on two philippine projects  resulted in a million increase in tax expense minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 
the minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries for the fiscal year was million compared to million the previous year 
the increase is primarily the result of the profits recognized on two new projects in the philippines  which accounted for of the revenues in the pacific rim in in comparison to of revenues in the previous fiscal year 
these projects are part of a joint venture in which the minority partner s interest is of pretax earnings 
backlog 
backlog at october  was million compared to million at october  of the backlog at october   million is for projects located in north america and million is for projects in pacific rim countries

revenues increased to million in compared to million in revenues from north american projects decreased by million to million in from million in the million decrease was due primarily to the acquisition of fcam 
revenues from pacific projects increased to million in from million in see factors that may affect future results below 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross profit as a percent of revenues decreased to in from in this decrease was due primarily to the decrease in relative importance of one high margin project that provided of total revenues in compared to in that project is scheduled for completion in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase primarily relates to additional costs incurred in anticipation of higher levels of business in management expects selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in as the company increases its infrastructure in anticipation of higher levels of business 
other operating and income items 
other items of income before income taxes increased by million to million in compared to a loss of million in foreign currency transaction losses decreased by million to a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in all foreign currency transaction losses relate to operations in thailand 
operations in hong kong have not generated foreign currency transaction losses as the hong kong dollar is pegged to the united states dollar

other items of income  primarily equity income from joint ventures  decreased by million to million in compared to million in income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate decreased to in from in due to the lower relative proportion of income before taxes attributable to united states operations in versus the effective tax rate of operations in the united states is 
generally  united states taxes may be incurred on international sales between the company s foreign subsidiaries 
however  the company s operations in hong kong  malaysia  and thailand operate under rules of the internal revenue code  local tax laws  and international tax treaties that results in little or no united states or foreign income taxes 
the company s new joint venture in the philippines may incur income taxes in the to range 
the company s effective income tax rates are expected to increase in the future as income from operations in hong kong  malaysia  and thailand account for a smaller portion of consolidated income before taxes 
backlog 
backlog at october  was million compared to million at october  of the backlog at october   million is for projects located in north america and million for projects in pacific rim countries 
the increase in backlog is attributable to the increase in the company s bonding capacity as a result of the company s initial public offering of its common stock

management expects that the company will have sufficient liquidity to meet ordinary short term and business needs for the foreseeable future 
sources of liquidity generally available to the company include cash from operations  cash and cash equivalents  availability under existing credit facilities  and borrowings from other sources 
operating activities 
the company s operating activities used million in cash in compared to providing million in the primary factor causing the decrease in cash flow in was due to a net loss of million and an increase in the materials acquired and the fabrication and assembly of finished units for active projects in the pacific rim that had not as yet been invoiced 
investing activities 
the company s capital expenditures totaled million in compared to million in in  the company invested approximately in the pacific rim area primarily in the philippines for plant improvements and equipment in order to accommodate the growth in revenues that resulted from two projects that commenced production activities in early fiscal the company also commenced expansion of its fabrication and assembly capacity in tennessee by leasing a facility and starting leasehold improvements to that plant in anticipation of increasing revenues in fiscal year from projects awarded in and the re commencement of projects that incurred start up delays in the investment in property  plant and equipment in of million is primarily attributable to the commencement of activities in the philippines and additional engineering offices in thailand and the philippines in  the company contributed million in capital to joint ventures in the philippines  mexico and the prc compared to million in the company loaned million to the developer of a joint venture in the prc during the company has reached a tentative agreement with the borrower for the repayment of the entire amount during fiscal year the company terminated the joint venture in mexico to the mutual satisfaction of both parties in late financing activities 
in  cash generated by financing activities amounted to million dollars 
net bank borrowings provided million and the purchase of  treasury shares used million 
cash generated by financing activities in increased to million from million in the increase was due primarily to the issuance of common stock for million

on july   the company s underwriters exercised their over allotment option with respect to  shares resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds of the offering are intended to be used to establish or acquire an interest in a fabrication facility in the prc  capital expenditures at its tennessee fabrication facility  working capital and general corporate purposes 
in addition  increased stockholders equity resulting from the offering will allow the company to secure more and larger bonding facilities 
pending the complete application of the net proceeds the company has invested the net proceeds in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
the company maintains lines of credit with commercial banks in the united states and in hong kong totaling million 
the lines of credit are used to provide letters of credit in connection with the importation of goods  overdraft facilities and short term financing 
the lines of credit are collateralized by million in the form of certificates of deposit and  in the case of the hong kong line  by the personal guarantee of the chairman of the company 
the personal guarantee of the chairman of the company was vacated in december the lines of credit are fully collateralized and carry no restrictive covenants such as minimum balances or ratios 
as of october  and  the company had approximately million and million respectively in borrowings under its lines of credit 
year compliance the company undertook a project to address the issue of computer programs and embedded computer chips being unable to distinguish between the year and the year yk 
the project was divided into three phases phase i involved identifying areas where yk problems exist or may exist 
this phase included both it and non it systems and the surveying of suppliers and customers 
phase ii involved repairing or replacing items that were not yk compliant including computer hardware and software 
this phase also involved identifying alternative sources of supply for major vendors that are not yk compliant 
phase iii involved testing significant systems and processes to assure their yk compliance 
all phases of the project were completed prior to december  the company s costs incurred in connection with achieving yk compliance were not material 
however  the company does not separately track the internal costs incurred for the yk project since such costs are principally the related payroll costs for information systems employees 
management estimates the total external costs have totaled less than thirty thousand dollars 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario of a major yk failure would be the failure of several major suppliers to deliver required materials on time 
as discussed above  this would involve mainly suppliers in north america 
in such a case the company could experience project delays of up to two weeks on projects 
such delays could result in higher levels of overtime for production and field installation workers as well as liquidating damages if projects are at critical stages near completion 
the costs in such a case could be million 
the company has contingency plans to minimize any yk problems 
in house computer systems are believed to be yk compliant 
management believes that the company is adequately prepared for the year and that its yk project will mitigate any material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as of january  the company has not become aware of any negative impact from a yk problem 
recently issued accounting standards a discussion of recently issued accounting standards is presented in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
factors that may affect future results general 
the company s projects are awarded by private or governmental entities in a competitive bidding process 
due to the nature of the bidding and award process  the company has experienced  and in the future expects to experience  significant delays in project awards 
no assurance can be given that the timing of a project award will be consistent with the company s expectations 
in addition  numerous factors  many of which are out of the company s ability to control  have caused and will continue to cause substantial variations in its results of operations in any quarterly or annual reporting period 
some of these factors are downturns in one or more segments of the construction industry  changes in economic conditions  the failure of project owners to obtain adequate construction financing  the failure of project general contractors to schedule other trades in a manner most efficient for flour city  the company s failure to obtain or delays in awards of major projects  the cancellation or delay of major projects  including cancellations or delays caused by job site labor problems and jurisdictional disputes  or the company s failure to timely replace projects that have been completed or are nearing completion 
dependence on large projects  the delay or abandonment of which could adversely affect the company 
any of these factors could cause the company s results of operations to fluctuate significantly from period to period  including on a quarterly basis 
foreign exchange risks 
the company generally attempts to mitigate foreign exchange risk by entering into contracts providing for payment in united states dollars instead of the local currency wherever possible 
nonetheless  local currency must be used to pay for local labor  raw materials or other local country costs of operations 
the company currently has contracts denominated in the hong kong dollar  thai baht and philippine peso 
future contracts may be denominated in the currency of other countries 
the company maintains cash  short term debt based on floating interest rates  accounts receivable  and accounts payable in several currencies 
the functional currencies in which those accounts are maintained match the functional currencies of construction contracts in process 
accounts are also maintained in united states dollars in all countries in which the company operates 
the following table shows the october  united states dollar translated balances of selected non us dollar denominated current accounts by the currency in which they are maintained hong kong thai philippine in millions dollars baht pesos cash and restricted cash short term debt accounts and claim receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses us dollar exchange rate at october  materials and services to perform project contracts are procured globally 
aluminum extrusion is typically the largest material cost and is generally denominated in united states dollars 
glass purchases are generally denominated in united states dollars unless sourced locally in a foreign locale 
the expenses associated with erection services are generally denominated in local currency 
to the extent that foreign currencies weaken against the united states dollar  the company will experience translation losses due to the revaluation of accounts payable  accounts receivable and other asset and liability accounts 
the company generally attempts to contract to secure compensation for devaluation of local currencies relative to the united states dollar 
in these instances  although the company may incur translation losses  the company seeks to offset such losses by increases in the amount of local currency payable to the company under contract so as to approximate the original united states dollar equivalent value of the contract 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in negotiating contracts with terms that maintain a united states dollar equivalency 
as of october   the company s backlog of non us dollar based contracts totaled approximately million 
of that amount contract provisions to ensure united states dollar equivalency did not protect approximately million 
exchange rate fluctuations in local currency denominated contracts that do not have a united states dollar equivalency  and in exchange rates in general  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
empire towers project 
the company has substantially completed a project located in bangkok  thailand the empire towers contract which is denominated in thai baht 
at october   the total amounts due to the company under the empire towers contract are the baht equivalent of million including million in construction receivables and million in claims receivable for currency exchange losses 
during  the current owner of the empire towers contract acknowledged liability for the baht equivalent of approximately million in exchange losses 
million of that acknowledged liability had been collected as of october  the remaining million had been deferred to the final completion of the contract which was scheduled for in  the company revised its estimate of anticipated total contract revenues when the owner of the project refused to honor claims previously agreed to which resulted in a reduction of revenues of million 
in addition  events occurring in the third quarter of fiscal  which involved quality issues of materials specified by the original owner  caused the company to establish a million reserve to cover all uncollected assets associated with this project 
the current owner of the project made allegation the company believes to be unsubstantiated 
the company is currently in discussions with the project owner and the materials supplier in order to seek a favorable resolution 
political uncertainties 
the company operates in several countries including countries in asia and in mexico 
economic development in countries in which the company operates may be limited by the imposition of measures intended to control economic conditions and the inadequate development of an infrastructure to support manufacturing and large scale construction projects 
changes in governmental policies as well as general economic conditions including interest rates or rates of inflation could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of october   the company had no holdings of commodity based instruments  long term debt instruments  forward contracts  futures contracts  firmly committed foreign sales contracts  interest rate swaps  currency swaps  or other items in the nature of derivative financial instruments 
the company does maintain cash  short term debt based on floating interest rates  accounts receivable  and accounts payable in several currencies
