item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
factors that may affect future stock performance the performance of the company s common stock is dependent upon several factors including those set forth below and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
control by majority shareholders  ability to issue preferred stock mr 
david a 
schuff  the company s chairman and co founder  and mr 
scott a 
schuff  the company s president  chief executive officer  co founder and a member of its board of directors  collectively control the voting of approximately of the outstanding common stock 
as a result  these individuals control the vote on all matters requiring approval of the stockholders  including causing or restricting the sale or merger of the company 
in addition  the company s certificate of incorporation authorizes the company to issue shares of blank check preferred stock  the designation  number  voting powers  preferences  and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors 
accordingly  the board of directors has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock 
volatility of stock price the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market for many companies and have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
the market price of the common stock is also subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in the company s quarterly operating results  analyst reports  announcements concerning the company  legislative or regulatory changes or the interpretation of existing statutes or regulations affecting the company s business  litigation  general trends in the industry and other events or factors 
in july  the company completed an initial public offering of its common stock for per share 
since that time  the company s common stock has traded as low as per share and as high as per share 
the market price for the company s common stock remains volatile and there is no assurance that the market price will not experience significant changes in the future 
shares eligible for future sale there were  shares of common stock outstanding as of march  of these shares   shares of common stock are freely tradable 
the  remaining shares of common stock are beneficially held by messrs 
david a 
schuff and scott a 
schuff and are restricted securities as that term is defined under rule promulgated under the securities act of the securities act 
in general  under rule as currently in effect  subject to the satisfaction of certain other conditions  if one year has elapsed since the later of the date of acquisition of restricted shares from either an issuer or an affiliate of an issuer  the acquirer or subsequent holder is entitled to sell in the open market  within any three month period  a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of one percent of the outstanding shares of the same class or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of the required notice of sale 
of the restricted securities outstanding  all of these shares have been held for the one year holding period required under rule no predictions can be made with respect to the effect  if any  that sales of common stock in the market or the availability of shares of common stock for sale under rule will have on the market price of common stock prevailing from time to time 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the open market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock and may make it more difficult for the company to sell its equity securities in the future on terms it deems appropriate

restricted funds on deposit represent funds on deposit in interest bearing escrow accounts which are maintained in lieu of retention for specific contracts 
retentions on contract receivables are amounts due which are withheld until the completed project has been accepted by the customer in accordance with the contract 
see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the company recognizes revenues and costs from construction projects using the percentage of completion accounting method 
under this method  revenues are recognized based upon the ratio of the costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the project  commencing when progress is sufficient to estimate final results with reasonable accuracy  which typically occurs when fabricated product is shipped to the project site or when erection of the project commences 
construction contracts with customers generally provide that billings are to be made monthly in amounts which are commensurate with the extent of performance under the contracts 
costs and recognized earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts primarily represent revenues earned under the percentage of completion method which have not been billed  and also include costs incurred in excess of billings on contracts for which sufficient work has not been performed to allow for recognition of revenues 
billings in excess of costs and recognized earnings on uncompleted contracts represent amounts billed on contracts in excess of the revenues allowed to be recognized under the percentage of completion method on those contracts  or the costs incurred on contracts for which sufficient work has not been performed to allow for recognition of revenues 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information regarding the company s financial position as of december  and  and its results of operations for the years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the preceding selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
introduction the company s results of operations are affected primarily by i the level of commercial and industrial construction in its principal markets  ii the company s ability to win project contracts  iii the amount and complexity of project changes requested by customers or general contractors  iv the company s success in utilizing its resources at or near full capacity  and v the company s ability to complete contracts on a timely and cost effective basis 
the level of commercial and industrial construction activity is related to several factors  including local  regional and national economic conditions  interest rates  availability of financing  and the supply of existing facilities relative to demand 
the company believes that there is an increasing trend in the steel fabrication and erection industry to design and build large  complex projects according to accelerated time schedules 
with many projects  only a portion of the detail design drawings are completed when construction begins 
the remaining drawings are completed  with numerous design changes being implemented  throughout the construction process 
these fast track  design as you go projects are well suited to integrated contractors that can i reduce the logistical and coordination problems inherent in the use of multiple subcontractors to complete a large  complex project and ii more efficiently respond to rapid and multiple design changes while minimizing project delays and cost overruns commonly associated with such changes 
the complexity and size of these projects require subcontractors possessing extended financial and operational capabilities 
individual large projects can have a substantial impact upon the company s results of operations and cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from quarter to quarter 
the company obtains contracts through competitive bidding or negotiation  which generally are either fixed price  cost plus or unit cost arrangements 
during  and  most of the company s revenues were derived from projects performed pursuant to fixed price contracts 
in bidding or negotiating contracts  the company must estimate its costs  including projected increases in labor  material  and service costs 
project duration typically lasts from one to twelve months 
the company recognizes revenues using the percentage of completion accounting method 
under this method  revenues are recognized based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total cost to complete the project 
revenue recognition begins when progress is sufficient to estimate final results with reasonable accuracy  which typically occurs when fabricated product is shipped to the project site or when erection of the project commences 
revenues relating to changes in the scope of a contract are recognized when the customer has authorized the change  the work is commenced and the company has made an estimate of the amount that will be paid for the change 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which revisions become known 
estimated losses on contracts are recognized in full when it is determined that a loss will be incurred on a contract 
cost of revenues consists of the costs of materials  equipment  direct labor  fringe benefits  and indirect costs associated with detailing  fabrication and erection  including rent  depreciation and supervisory labor 
other costs not associated with specific projects are included in general and administrative expenses 
gross profit margins can be positively and negatively affected by large  more complex projects  the percentage of negotiated contracts relative to competitively bid contracts  the number and scope of contract modifications  and improvements in operating efficiencies 
gross profit margins can be adversely affected by construction delays  inefficient or underutilization of the company s resources  availability and cost of materials and labor  the timing and performance of work by other contractors  weather conditions and construction site conditions 
backlog increases as contract commitments are obtained  decreases as revenues are recognized  and increases or decreases to reflect modifications in the work to be performed under the contract 
the timing of contract commitments  the size of projects and other factors beyond the company s control can cause significant fluctuation in backlog outstanding at any given date 
prior to the completion of the company s initial public offering in july  the company was taxed as an s corporation for income tax purposes 
accordingly  its income was taxed directly to its stockholders 
immediately prior to the initial public offering  the company s s corporation election was revoked and the company became subject to income tax as a c corporation

on october   the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of bannister 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  of which approximately million was paid in cash and a million in the form of a promissory note secured by a letter of credit 
the acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and accordingly  the purchase prices have been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on the fair value at the date of the acquisition with the excess of the purchase price over net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill 
the operating results of addison  quincy  six  and bannister have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the closing date of each of the acquisitions

liquidity and capital resources the company attempts to structure the payment arrangements under its contracts to match costs incurred under the project 
to the extent the company is able to bill in advance of costs incurred  it generates working capital through billings in excess of costs and recognized earnings on uncompleted contracts 
to the extent the company is not able to bill in advance of costs  it relies on its credit facilities to meet its working capital needs 
at december   the company had million of outstanding borrowings under its line of credit  with approximately million available for borrowings  and working capital of approximately million 
the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity through its present resources and the existence of its bank credit facility to meet its near term operating needs

operating activities provided cash flows of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   operating cash flows were less than net income primarily due to a million increase in costs and recognized earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and a million increase in receivables resulting from increased revenues

financing activities required  for the year ended december  and provided million for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities in was primarily a result of million in net proceeds from the million private placement of the company s senior notes  of which million was used to pay existing indebtedness of the company 
the company maintains a million credit facility with a bank that matures on june   which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the credit facility is secured by a first priority  perfected security interest in all assets of the company and its present and future subsidiaries 
the company will be eligible for reductions in the interest rates on the credit facility if the company achieves certain leverage ratio targets 
the interest rates  based on the leverage ratio achieved  can range from a minimum of prime or libor plus to a maximum of prime plus or libor plus 
at december   there was approximately million of credit available under the credit facility for borrowings  which has been reduced by approximately million of outstanding letters of credits under which the company is committed 
the credit facility also requires that the company maintain specified leverage ratios  interest coverage ratios  fixed charge coverage ratios and a specified minimum ebitda

however  the company may expand its operations through future acquisitions and may require additional equity or debt financing 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  the company adopted the new statement effective january  the statement requires the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset  liability  or firm commitment through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial position 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company s future operating results and financial condition are dependent on a number of factors that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
the following potential risks and uncertainties  together with those mentioned elsewhere herein  including in item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters  could affect the company s future operating results  financial condition  and the market price of its common stock 
substantial leverage and ability to service debt with the company s senior notes  existing line of credit facility and other positionings  the company is highly leveraged with substantial debt service in addition to operating expenses and planned capital expenditures 
the company s senior notes permit the company to incur additional indebtedness  subject to certain limitations  including additional secured indebtedness under existing credit facilities 
the company s level of indebtedness will have several important effects on its future operations  including  without limitation  i a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on its indebtedness  reducing the funds available for operations and for capital expenditures  including acquisitions  ii covenants contained in the senior notes or the credit facility or other credit facilities will require the company to meet certain financial tests  and other restrictions will limit its ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of assets  and may affect the company s flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in its business  including possible acquisition activities  iii the company s leveraged position will substantially increase its vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions  iv the company s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate and other purposes may be limited and v the company s leveraged position and the various covenants contained in the senior notes and the credit facility may place the company at a relative competitive disadvantage as compared to certain of its competitors 
the company s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will be dependent upon the company s future performance  which will be subject to general economic  industry and competitive conditions and to financial  business and other factors affecting the operations of the company  many of which are beyond its control 
there can be no assurance that the company s business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt  it may be required  among other things  to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  to refinance or restructure all or a portion of its indebtedness  including the senior notes  to sell selected assets  or to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures and growth or business strategies 
there can be no assurance that any such measures would be sufficient to enable the company to service its debt  or that any of these measures could be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
fluctuating quarterly results of operations the company has experienced  and in the future is expected to continue to experience  substantial variations in its results of operations from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
in particular  the company s operating results may vary because of downturns in one or more segments of the building construction industry  changes in economic conditions  the company s failure to obtain  or delays in awards of  major projects  the cancellation of major projects  or the company s failure to timely replace projects that have been completed or are nearing completion 
in addition  from time to time the company has disputes with its customers concerning change orders to its contracts 
to the extent such disputes are not resolved on a timely basis  the company s results of operations may be effected 
any of the foregoing factors could result in the periodic inefficient or underutilization of the company s resources and could cause the company s operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period  including on a quarterly basis 
no assurance of successful acquisitions in addition to the acquisitions of addison  quincy  six and bannister  the company intends to consider acquisitions of and alliances with other companies in its industry that could complement the company s business  including the acquisition of entities in diverse geographic regions and entities offering greater access to industries and markets not currently served by the company 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition or alliance candidates can be identified or  if identified  that the company will be able to consummate such transactions 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate successfully any acquired companies into its existing operations  which could increase the company s operating expenses 
moreover  any acquisition by the company may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of additional debt and amortization of expenses related to goodwill and intangible assets  all of which could adversely affect the company s profitability 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  such as diverting attention of the company s management from other business concerns  the entrance of the company into markets in which it has had no or only limited experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the acquisitions of addison  quincy  six  and bannister have consumed and will continue to consume substantial management attention and resources of the company and will require substantial efforts and entail certain risks in the integration of their operations 
there can be no assurance that anticipated cost savings or synergies will be achieved 
the company will be dependent on the retention and future performance of key officers and employees of addison  quincy  six  and bannister for day to day management and future operating results 
fixed price contracts of the company s million backlog at december   most consisted of projects being performed on a fixed price basis 
in bidding on projects  the company estimates its costs  including projected increases in costs of labor  material and services 
despite these estimates  costs and gross profit realized on a fixed price contract may vary from estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions  variations in labor and equipment productivity over the terms of contracts  higher than expected increases in labor or material costs and other factors 
these variations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for any period 
variations in backlog  dependence on large contracts the company s backlog can be significantly affected by the receipt  or loss  of individual contracts 
for example  approximately million  representing of the company s backlog at december   was attributable to two contracts 
in the event one or more large contracts were terminated or their scope reduced  the company s backlog could decrease substantially 
the company s future business and results of operations may be adversely affected if it is unable to replace significant contracts when lost or completed  or if it otherwise fails to maintain a sufficient level of backlog 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business backlog 
dependence on construction industry the company earns virtually all of its revenues in the building construction industry  which is subject to local  regional and national economic cycles 
the company s revenues and cash flows depend to a significant degree on major construction projects in various industries  including the hotel and casino  retail shopping  health care  mining  computer chip manufacturing  public works and other industries  each of which industries may be adversely affected by general or specific economic conditions 
if construction activity declines significantly in the company s principal markets  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
capacity constraints  dependence on subcontractors the company routinely relies on subcontractors to perform a significant portion of its fabrication  erection and project detailing to fulfill projects that the company cannot fulfill in house due to capacity constraints or that are in markets in which the company has not established a strong local presence 
with respect to these projects  the company s success depends on its ability to retain and successfully manage these subcontractors 
any difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified subcontractors on terms and conditions favorable to the company could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to complete these projects in a timely and cost effective manner 
union contracts the company currently is a party to a number of collective bargaining agreements with various unions representing some of the company s fabrication and erection employees 
these contracts expire or are subject to expiration at various times in the future 
the inability of the company to renew such contracts could result in work stoppages and other labor disturbances  which could disrupt the company s business and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
revenue recognition estimates the company recognizes revenues using the percentage of completion accounting method 
under this method  revenues are recognized based on the ratio that costs incurred to date bear to the total estimated costs to complete the project 
estimated losses on contracts are recognized in full when the company determines that a loss will be incurred 
the company frequently reviews and revises revenues and total cost estimates as work progresses on a contract and as contracts are modified 
accordingly  revenue adjustments based upon the revised completion percentage are reflected in the period that estimates are revised 
although revenue estimates are based upon management assumptions supported by historical experience  these estimates could vary materially from actual results 
to the extent percentage of completion adjustments reduce previously reported revenues  the company would recognize a charge against operating results  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for the applicable period 
geographic concentration the company s fabrication and erection operations currently are conducted primarily in arizona  nevada  florida  georgia  california and texas  states in which the construction industry has experienced substantial growth during recent years 
because of this concentration  future construction activity and the company s business may be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in economic conditions existing in these states and in the southwestern and southeastern united states generally 
factors that may affect economic conditions include increases in interest rates or limitations in the availability of financing for construction projects  decreases in the amount of funds budgeted for governmental projects  decreases in capital expenditures devoted to the construction of plants  distribution centers  retail shopping centers  industrial facilities  hotels and casinos  convention centers and other facilities  the prevailing market prices of copper  gold and other metals that impact related mining activity  and downturns in occupancy rates  office space demand  tourism and convention related activity and population growth 
operating risks  litigation construction and heavy steel plate weldments involve a high degree of operational risk 
natural disasters  adverse weather conditions  design  fabrication and erection errors and work environment accidents can cause death or personal injury  property damage and suspension of operations 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in loss of revenues  increased costs  and liability to third parties 
the company is subject to litigation claims in the ordinary course of business  including lawsuits asserting substantial claims 
currently  the company does not maintain any reserves for its ongoing litigation 
the company periodically reviews the need to maintain a litigation reserve 
the company maintains risk management  insurance  and safety programs intended to prevent or mitigate losses 
there can be no assurance that any of these programs will be adequate or that the company will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that it considers reasonable 
risks of international operations the company currently operates in selected international markets and is seeking to further expand its presence in these markets 
less than of the company s revenues in  however  were related to projects outside the united states 
the company s international operations are subject to certain political  economic and other uncertainties  including risks of war  nationalization of assets  renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts  changing political conditions  changing laws and policies affecting trade and investment  and overlap of different tax structures 
although the company currently attempts to limit its exposure to currency fluctuations by dealing solely in united states dollars  there can be no assurance that the company s international operations will escape the risks of fluctuating currency values  hard currency shortages  or controls on currency exchange 
competition many small and various large companies offer fabrication  erection and related services that compete with those provided by the company 
local and regional companies offer competition in one or more of the company s geographic markets or product segments 
out of state or international companies may provide competition in any market 
the company competes for every project it obtains 
although the company believes customers consider  among other things  the availability and technical capabilities of equipment and personnel  efficiency  safety record and reputation  price competition usually is the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a contract 
competition has resulted in pressure on pricing and operating margins  and the effects of competitive pressure in the industry may continue 
some of the company s competitors have greater capital and other resources than the company and are well established in their respective markets 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not substantially increase their commitment of resources devoted to competing aggressively with the company or that the company will be able to compete profitably with its competitors 
substantial liquidity requirements the company s operations require significant amounts of working capital to procure materials for contracts to be performed over relatively long periods  and for purchases and modifications of heavy duty and specialized fabrication equipment 
in addition  the company s contract arrangements with customers sometimes require the company to provide payment and performance bonds and  in selected cases  letters of credit  to partially secure the company s obligations under its contracts  which may require the company to incur significant expenditures prior to receipt of payments 
furthermore  the company s customers often will retain a portion of amounts otherwise payable to the company during the course of a project as a guarantee of completion of that project 
to the extent the company is unable to receive project payments in the early stages of a project  the company s cash flow would be reduced  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon key personnel the company s success depends on the continued services of the company s senior management and key employees as well as the company s ability to attract additional members to its management team with experience in the steel fabrication and erection industry 
the unexpected loss of the services of any of the company s management or other key personnel  or its inability to attract new management when necessary  could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
potential environmental liability the company s operations and properties are affected by numerous federal  state and local environmental protection laws and regulations  such as those governing discharges to air and water and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
compliance with these laws and regulations has become increasingly stringent  complex and costly 
there can be no assurance that such laws and regulations or their interpretation will not change in a manner that could materially and adversely affect the company 
certain environmental laws  such as the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and its state law counterparts  provide for strict and joint and several liability for investigation and remediation of spills and other releases of toxic and hazardous substances 
these laws may apply to conditions at properties currently or formerly owned or operated by an entity or its predecessors  as well as to conditions at properties at which wastes or other contamination attributable to an entity or its predecessors come to be located 
although the company has not incurred any material environmental related liability in the past and believes that it is in material compliance with environmental laws  there can be no assurance that the company  or entities for which it may be responsible  will not incur such liability in connection with the investigation and remediation of facilities it currently operates or formerly owned or operated or other locations in a manner that could materially and adversely affect the company 
governmental regulation many aspects of the company s operations are subject to governmental regulations in the united states and in other countries in which the company operates  including regulations relating to occupational health and workplace safety  principally the occupational safety and health act and regulations thereunder 
in addition  the company is subject to licensure and holds or has applied for licenses in each of the states in the united states in which it operates and in certain local jurisdictions within such states 
although the company believes that it is in material compliance with applicable laws and permitting requirements  there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain this status 
further  the company cannot determine to what extent future operations and earnings of the company may be affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in or new interpretations of existing regulations 
potential asset impairment in december  the company temporarily suspended its efforts to install new financial accounting software 
included in other assets on the company s balance sheet at december  are million of cumulative related costs 
under sfas no 
 the suspension of this project is an indication of impairment  which could result in the write off of some or all of the accumulated costs at some future date if the company is not successful in completing the project 
however  the company s management intends to complete the project when the software vendor completes certain modifications to the software 
impact of year in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any future year matters that may arise are addressed promptly

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments during and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments 
primary market risk exposure the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates associated with its holding variable rate debt million outstanding balance at december  
assuming an identical outstanding balance for all of  a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates would increase interest expense for the year by approximately the company is potentially exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its million fixed rate senior notes  which were issued on june  specifically  the company is exposed to changes in the fair value of its million senior notes 
at december   the fair value of the senior notes was approximately of par or million 
from january  to december   the senior notes had a fair value that was as low as of par and as high as of par 
the variation in fair value is a function of market interest rate changes and the investor perception of the investment quality of the senior notes
