item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk matrix has subsidiary companies whose operations are located in canada and venezuela 
matrix s financial results could be affected if these companies incur a permanent decline in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the economic conditions in these foreign countries 
matrix attempts to mitigate these risks by investing in different countries and business segments 
venezuela s currency has recently suffered significant devaluation and volatility 
the ultimate severity of the conditions in venezuela remain uncertain  as does the long term impact on matrix s investment  however  the total investment in venezuela is not material to the financial position of matrix taken as a whole and matrix has exited all operations in venezuela
