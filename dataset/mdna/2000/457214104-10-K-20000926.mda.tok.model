general we are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the research and development of products which may be used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases 
we pursue these objectives through a technology platform consisting of the fc receptor technology  the thrombospondin technology and visicol tm 
we acquired these technologies in see note of the notes to financial statements 
since commencing operations in  we have not generated any sales revenue 
we have funded operations primarily from the proceeds of public and private placements of securities 
we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception  and expect to incur additional losses in the foreseeable future 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter  and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
at june   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
results of operations we incurred losses of   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
we expect to incur additional losses in the foreseeable future 
the basic and diluted per share loss was  and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
losses are expected to increase in the forthcoming short year as we continue to develop the thrombospondin technology and fc receptor technology  and also incur significant commercialization costs of visicol tm 
research and development expenses fluctuated on an annual basis from fiscal year through fiscal year due to changes in manufacturing development expenses and clinical and preclinical testing costs associated with visicol tm  cbp and the thrombospondin program 
the decrease in research and development expenses from fiscal year to fiscal year of  is principally due to the reduction in clinical development costs being partially offset by increases in costs associated with manufacturing development and nda submission costs for visicol tm 
the increase in research and development expenses from fiscal year to fiscal year of  was principally due to conducting a phase i  phase iib dose ranging and phase iii clinical trial of visicol tm along with manufacturing costs associated with visicol tm 
research and development expenses are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as we continue towards commercialization of visicol tm 
additional research and development expenses will include hiring personnel to direct the clinical and manufacturing activities with respect to visicol tm and cbp and additional personnel to direct the research and development activities on the thrombospondin technology and other technologies 
substantial resources will continue to be expended on the phase ii and phase iii trials currently underway with respect to cbp in the areas of ibd and itp 
purchased research and development amounted to  for the year ended june  as a result of inkine s acquisition of the fc receptor technology and the thrombospondin technology in november  along with additional costs associated with the earlier purchase of visicol tm in fiscal year ended june  a majority of the purchase price  was a non cash charge to earnings related to the issuance of common stock and options for the technologies 
general and administrative expenses amounted to   and  for the years ended june   and respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to reduced amortization of deferred compensation from options previously granted to certain executive officers of  in fiscal year  as compared to  for the same period a year ago 
this decrease was offset by an increase in marketing costs and an increase in head count in fiscal year the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal year versus fiscal year is due to reduced amortization of options in connection with our restructuring in fiscal year general and administrative expenses will continue to increase with the addition of other administrative personnel  amortization of deferred compensation and an expanded scale of operations associated with the development of multiple technologies 
a one time charge resulted from a separation agreement with the former president and chief operating officer due to his resignation from inkine in november his employment contract provided for certain benefits upon resignation prior to the completion of the terms of the contract 
the contract required the immediate vesting of all outstanding unvested options which resulted in a non cash charge of  and the continuation of his salary and other benefits for a period of several months 
this resulted in an additional charge of approximately  the decrease in interest income of  from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to earnings on a lower investment balance as compared to the previous year  partially offset by an increase in the effective interest rate earned during the increase in interest income in the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  is principally due to the earnings on an increased investment balance 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of  cash and cash equivalents is comprised primarily of the proceeds from two private placements of common stock of approximately  during fiscal year in order to preserve principal and maintain liquidity  our funds are invested in us government obligations and other secured short term investments 
we believe that our financial resources are adequate for our operations for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors which cannot be quantified and many of which we cannot control  including continued progress in our research and development activities  commercialization costs of visicol tm  progress with pre clinical studies and clinical trials  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  technological and market developments  the ability to establish product development arrangements  the cost of manufacturing scaleup  effective marketing activities and arrangements  and licensing or acquisition activity 
we may seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners and others  and from other sources 
no assurance can be given that necessary additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate additional funds are not available when required  we may have to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of our research  drug discovery or development activities or certain other aspects of our operations and our business will be materially and adversely affected 
we plan to expend significant resources in new personnel in the next months in connection with the expansion of our commercial activities surrounding visicol tm 
we anticipate incurring additional losses in the foreseeable future  as we expand our commercialization activities relating to visicol tm  and research and development activities relating to the thrombospondin technology and fc receptor technology 
to achieve profitability  we alone or with others  must successfully develop and commercialize our technologies and products  conduct pre clinical studies and clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture  introduce and market such technologies and products 
the time required to reach profitability is highly uncertain  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all
