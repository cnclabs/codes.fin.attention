item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in risk factors as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview since our inception  substantially all of our revenues have been generated by our ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions business 
contracts for these ground segment systems and networks and communications services have been fixed price contracts in virtually all cases 
profitability of such contracts is subject to inherent uncertainties as to the cost of performance 
in addition to possible errors or omissions in making initial estimates  cost overruns may be incurred as a result of unforeseen obstacles including both physical conditions and unexpected problems encountered in engineering design and testing 
since our business may at times be concentrated in a limited number of large contracts  a significant cost overrun on any contract could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the period from contract award through installation of ground segment systems and networks and communications services supplied by us generally requires from three to months 
we use the percentage of completion method of accounting for contract revenues upon the achievement of various milestones 
accordingly  most of the revenues from sales of products is typically recognized when the product is shipped  with the balance recognized at the time of acceptance by the customer 
revenues from providing satellite based communications services are recognized at the time the service is performed 
costs of revenues are generally recorded based on the relationship of the amount of projected final costs to the percentage of revenue recorded for the specific contract 
costs of revenues consist primarily of the costs of purchased materials  direct labor and related overhead expenses  project related travel  living costs and subcontractor salaries 
in addition  cost of revenues relating to internet access service fees consists primarily of satellite space segment charges and internet connectivity fees 
network operations expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the operation of netsat express network operations center on a twenty four hour a day  seven day a week basis including personnel and related costs 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  travel and living costs for sales and marketing personnel 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead expenses paid to engineers 
general and administrative expenses consist of expenses associated with our management  accounting  contract and administrative functions 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses  network operations  selling and marketing  and research and development  will continue to increase during the next several years due to expected increases in personnel and related expenses to support our increasing service base

fiscal years ended june  and revenues 
revenues  which were primarily derived from sales of ground segment systems and networks  decreased by million  or from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease relates primarily to the decrease in the shipment and or completion of ground segment systems and networks contracts as a result of a decline in the bookings of contract orders due to the continuing difficult economic conditions in the pacific rim  russia and other international markets 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the shipment and or completion of ground segment systems and networks contracts 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was due primarily to a significant negotiated contract in the second and third quarters of fiscal  which resulted in a higher gross profit margin for the fiscal year ended june   as well as pricing pressures in the marketplace 
network operations 
network operations expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million and related to the implementation of netsat express network operations center on a twenty four hour a day  seven day a week basis during the current fiscal year 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the increase in marketing and bid and proposal efforts in the americas and africa  as well as the related increase in sales and marketing personnel

write down of investments 
write down of investments of million for the fiscal year ended june   related to two investments which were written down in the fourth quarter ended june  our management evaluated the investments and believed it would be appropriate to write down the investments to zero 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income decreased by million from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  this decrease was primarily due to the reduction of cash and cash equivalents from june  to june  interest expense was minimal for the fiscal years ended june  and netsat express 
our consolidated subsidiary  netsat express  experienced an increase in revenues of million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase resulted from the implementation of internet access services in january  as well as an increase in the equipment sales and activations 
the loss from operations associated with netsat express increased by million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily associated with an increase in general and administrative expenses relating to an increase in personnel to support the overall growth of netsat express and the implementation of operating netsat express network operations center on a twenty four hour a day  seven day a week basis during the year 
quarterly results the following tables set forth unaudited financial information for each of the eight fiscal quarters in the period ended june  we believe that this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the annual report on form k  and we believe all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results of operations when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

see risk factors beginning on page liquidity and capital resources at june   we had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  restricted cash of million  net accounts receivable of million  net inventories of million  prepaid expenses and other current assets of million and deferred income taxes of million  offset by million in accounts payable and million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
several factors had an effect on our liquidity during the fiscal year ended june  first  we used million for operating activities  which primarily relates to an increase in net accounts receivable of million due to an increase in billings to customers in june  an increase in net inventories of million due to timing of project shipments  a decrease in accounts payable of million reflecting the timing of large payments to vendors  offset by an increase in accrued expenses of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million mainly due to a large advance payment from one customer  an increase of the deferred liability of million pursuant to a technology agreement entered into in connection with netsat express private placement of common stock and an increase in accrued interest of million for the interest portion of our capital lease obligation not paid as of june  the second factor affecting liquidity during the fiscal year ended june   was our financing activities 
in april   we completed a secondary public offering of  shares of our common stock for a price of per share 
we raised net proceeds of approximately million net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other related expenses 
the net proceeds will be used to provide a revolving credit facility for up to million to netsat express  for its working capital and general corporate purposes and for our working capital and general corporate purposes 
management anticipates that netsat express will experience negative cash flow due to the capital investment required for continued development of its operations and continued loss from operating activities for an extended period of time 
in august  netsat express completed a private placement of common and preferred stock yielding net proceeds of approximately million  net of issuance costs 
these proceeds were used to fund netsat express operations  expand marketing initiatives  engineering efforts and fund capital expansion 
in october  we  together with netsat express  entered into a common stock purchase agreement with an investor to purchase  shares of netsat express common stock of which  shares were purchased directly from us see investing activities below and  shares were issued and sold directly by netsat express for million 
the net proceeds received by netsat express of million  net of issuance costs  were used to fund operations  expand marketing initiatives  engineering efforts and fund capital expansion 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended june   we received million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the third factor affecting liquidity during the fiscal year ended june   was our investing activities 
during the fiscal year ended june   we purchased million in fixed assets  restricted cash decreased million due primarily to the expiration of a letter of credit and the redemption of a certificate of deposit held as collateral  and we received million of net proceeds from the sale of  shares of netsat express common stock which are intended to be used for general corporate purposes 
we have a million credit facility consisting of a million secured domestic line of credit and a million secured export import guaranteed line of credit at june  this line of credit expired in december at which time the company entered into a new credit facility with substantially the same terms  which expires in december each line of credit bears interest at the prime rate at june  plus a variable margin rate ranging from to per annum at june  based on the company s tangible net worth calculation  as defined in the credit facility  and is collateralized by a first security interest on all the company s assets 
the credit facilities contains certain financial covenants  which the company is in compliance with at june  as of june   no amounts were outstanding under such credit facilities 
we also lease satellite space segment services and other equipment under various capital and operating lease agreements which expire in various years through future minimum lease payments due on these leases through the fiscal year ending june  is approximately  we expect that our cash and working capital requirements for our operating activities will continue to increase as we expand our operations 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the success of our marketing efforts in the ground segment systems  networks  and communications services business  the nature and timing of customer orders  the extent to which we are able to locate additional strategic suppliers in whose technology we wish to invest  the extent to which we must conduct research and development efforts internally and potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
based on current plans  we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements through june however  we cannot assure you that there will be no change that would consume available resources significantly before that time 
additional funds may not be available when needed and even if available  additional funds may be raised through financing arrangements and or the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we will be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our operating activities  including without limitation  the timing and extent of our marketing programs  the extent and timing of hiring additional personnel and our research and development activities and operating activities of netsat express 
we cannot assure you that that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
impact of year in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we incurred minimal costs during in connection with remediating our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the securities and exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sec staff addressed several issues in sab no 
 including timing for recognizing revenues derived from selling arrangements that involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and when installation and title transfer occurs after shipment 
the company s existing revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenues based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for contract revenue upon the achievement of certain milestones 
accordingly  revenue from fixed price contracts are generally recorded based on the relationship of total costs incurred to date to total projected final costs 
management is currently evaluating the effect of this change  if any  on its consolidated financial position  results of operations  liquidity and cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  because of the company s minimal use of derivatives  management does not anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a significant effect on earnings or the consolidated financial position of the company 
risk factors we have a history of operating losses and negative cash flows and expect our losses to continue 
we have incurred significant net losses since we began operating in august we incurred net losses of million during the fiscal year ended june   million during the fiscal year ended june  and million during the fiscal year ended june  our net losses include net losses of million during the fiscal year ended june   million during the fiscal year ended june  and million during the fiscal year ended june  for netsat express 
as of june   our accumulated deficit was million 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses 
our ability to achieve and maintain profitability will depend upon our ability to generate significant revenues through new customer contracts and the expansion of our existing products and services  including our communications services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new customer contracts or generate significant additional revenues from those contracts or any new products or services that we introduce 
even if we become profitable  we may not sustain or increase our profits on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
risks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects 
we market and sell our products and services in the united states and internationally 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
we presently conduct our international sales in the following regions africa  the pacific rim region  australia  central and south america  eastern and central europe and the middle east 
there are some risks inherent in conducting our business internationally  including o changes in regulatory requirements could restrict our ability to deliver services to our international customers  o export restrictions  tariffs  licenses and other trade barriers could prevent us from adequately equipping our network facilities  o differing technology standards across countries may impede our ability to integrate our products and services across international borders  o political and economic instability in international markets could impede our ability to deliver our services to customers and harm our financial results  o protectionist laws and business practices favoring local competition may give unequal bargaining leverage to key vendors in countries where competition is scarce  significantly increasing our operating costs  o increased expenses associated with marketing services in foreign countries  o decreases in value of foreign currency relative to the us dollar  o relying on local subcontractors for installation of our products and services  o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  o potentially adverse taxes  o complying with complex foreign laws and treaties  and o difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
these and other risks could impede our ability to manage our international business effectively  limit the future growth of our business  increase our costs and require significant management attention 
if we are not successful in selling our communications services to our customers for whom we have historically provided satellite ground segment systems and networks  our results of operations will be harmed 
we have historically provided our customers with satellite ground segment systems and networks on a project basis 
we currently market our communications services to our existing customers 
these services not only provide the implementation of the satellite ground segment systems and networks but also provide the ongoing operation and maintenance of these services 
if we are not successful in selling these communications services to our existing customers  it will harm our results of operations 
if netsat express does not execute its business strategy or if the market for its services fails to develop or develops more slowly than it expects  our stock price may be adversely affected 
netsat express future revenues and results of operations are dependent on its execution of its business strategy and the development of the market for its current and future services 
if netsat express does not execute its business strategy or execute it to the expectation level of public market analysts  these public market analysts may reduce the value they assign to netsat express 
if the market for its current or future services fails to develop  or develops more slowly than it expects  then public market analysts may reduce the value they assign to netsat express 
in the event these analysts  in either case  reduce the value they assign netsat express  it would have a material adverse affect on the market price of our stock 
currency devaluations in the foreign markets in which we operate could decrease demand for our products and services 
we denominate our foreign sales in us dollars 
consequently  decreases in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar in the markets in which we operate  adversely affect the demand for our products and services by increasing the price of our products and services in the currencies of the countries in which they are sold 
the difficult economic conditions in russia and other international markets and the resulting foreign currency devaluations have led to a decrease in demand for our products and services and the decrease in bookings received by us from these and other foreign regions has adversely effected our results of operations for the fiscal year ended june  we expect that these negative trends will continue to adversely impact our results of operations 
you should not rely on our quarterly operating results as an indication of our future results because they are subject to significant fluctuations  and if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors  our stock price could decline significantly 
our future revenues and results of operations may significantly fluctuate due to a combination of factors  including o the length of time needed to initiate and complete customer contracts  o delays in the booking of new contracts  o the demand for and acceptance of our existing products and services  o the cost of providing our products and services  o the introduction of new and improved products and services by us or our competitors  o market acceptance of new products and services  o the mix of revenue between our standard products  custom built products and our communications services  o the level of demand for our existing products and services in developing countries with emerging markets for our services  o the timing of significant marketing programs  o our ability to hire and retain additional personnel  o the competition in our markets  and o general economic conditions in the united states and abroad  including the difficult economic conditions and currency devaluations in russia and other international markets which have  and may continue to  adversely impact our quarterly results 
accordingly  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
our markets are highly competitive and we have many established competitors  and we may lose market share as a result 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and this competition could harm our ability to sell our products and services on prices and terms favorable to us 
our primary competitors in the satellite ground segment and networks services include vertically integrated satellite systems providers like nippon electric corporation  and systems integrators like idb systems  a division of mci worldcom  inc in the communications services and internet access services markets  we compete with other satellite communication companies who provide similar services  like loral cyberstar  inc and panamsat corporation  as well as other internet services providers 
in addition  we may compete with other communications services providers like teleglobe  inc and mci worldcom 
we anticipate that our competitors may develop or acquire services that provide functionality that is similar to that provided by our services and that those services may be offered at significantly lower prices or bundled with other services 
in addition  we anticipate that continuing deregulation worldwide is expected to result in the formation of a significant number of new competitive service providers over the next two or three years 
these competitors have the financial resources to withstand substantial price competition and may be in a better position to endure difficult economic conditions in the pacific rim region  russia and other international markets  and may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
moreover  many of our competitors have more extensive customer bases  broader customer relationships and broader industry alliances that they could use to their advantage in competitive situations 
the markets in which we operate have limited barriers to entry and we expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors and new market entrants in the future 
moreover  our current and potential competitors have established or may establish strategic relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products and services to address the needs of our current and prospective customers 
existing and new competitors with their potential strategic relationships may rapidly acquire significant market share  which would harm our business and financial condition 
if the satellite communications industry fails to continue to develop or new technology makes it obsolete  our business and financial condition will be harmed 
our business is dependent on the continued success and development of satellite communications technology  which competes with terrestrial communications transport technologies like terrestrial microwave  coaxial cable and fiber optic communications systems 
if the satellite communications industry fails to continue to develop  or any technological development significantly improves the cost or efficiency of competing terrestrial systems relative to satellite systems  then our business and financial condition would be materially harmed 
we may be unable to raise additional funds to meet our capital requirements in the future 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations in each year since our inception 
we believe that our available cash resources  together with the proceeds of this offering  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through june however  our future liquidity and capital requirements are difficult to predict  as they depend on numerous factors  including the success of our existing product and services offerings as well as competing technological and market developments 
we may need to raise additional funds in order to meet additional working capital requirements and to support additional capital expenditures 
should this need arise  additional funds may not be available when needed and  even if additional funds are available  we may not find the terms favorable or commercially reasonable 
if adequate funds are unavailable  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our operating activities  including marketing programs  hiring of additional personnel and research and development programs 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders will own a smaller percentage of our capital stock and new investors may pay less on average for their securities than  and could have rights superior to  existing stockholders 
please see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a more complete description of our historical financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we rely on our relationships with resellers in developing countries with emerging markets for sales of our products and services and the loss or failure of any of these relationships may harm our ability to market and sell our services 
we intend to provide our products and services and netsat express services almost entirely in developing countries where we have little or no market experience 
we intend to rely on resellers in those markets to provide their expertise and knowledge of the local regulatory environment in order to make access to customers in emerging markets easier 
if we are unable to maintain these relationships  or develop new ones in other emerging markets  our ability to enter into and compete successfully in developing countries would be adversely affected 
a limited number of customers account for a high percentage of our revenue  and the loss of a key customer would adversely affect our revenues  business and financial condition 
we rely on a small number of customers for a large portion of our revenues and expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers 
for the fiscal year ended june   two customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
we anticipate that our operating results in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenues from large contracts with a small number of customers 
as a result of this concentration of our customer base  a loss of or decrease in business from one or more of these customers would materially adversely affect our revenues and financial condition 
our inability to effectively manage our growth and expansion could seriously harm our ability to effectively run our business 
since our inception  we have continued to increase the scope of our operations 
this growth has placed  and our anticipated growth will continue to place  a significant strain on our personnel  management  financial and other resources 
any failure to manage our growth effectively could seriously harm our ability to respond to customers  monitor the quality of our products and services and maintain the overall efficiency of our operations 
in order to continue to pursue the opportunities presented by our satellite based communications services  we plan to continue to hire a significant number of key officers and other employees and to increase our operating expenses by broadening our customer support capabilities  expanding our sales and marketing operations and improving our operating and financial systems 
if we fail to manage any future growth in an efficient manner  and at a pace consistent with our business  our revenues  financial condition and business will be harmed 
we anticipate significant revenues from three contracts and a modification or termination of all or any of these contracts could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
we have agreements with three customers to provide equipment and services  which we expect to generate substantial revenues from 
if any of these customers are unable to implement their business plans  the market for their services declines  or all or any of the customers modifies or terminates its agreement with us  our financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 
we are paid a fixed price in most of our customer contracts  and any variation between the fixed price and the actual cost of performance may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
a majority of our customer contracts are on a fixed price basis 
the profitability of these contracts is subject to inherent uncertainties in the cost of performance  including costs related to unforeseen obstacles and unexpected problems encountered in engineering  design  implementation and testing of our products and services 
because a significant portion of our revenues is dependent upon a small number of customers  if the fixed price is significantly less than the actual cost of performance on any one contract  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if our products and services are not accepted in developing countries with emerging markets  our revenues will be impaired 
we anticipate that a substantial portion of the growth in the demand for our products and services will come from customers in developing countries due to a lack of basic communications infrastructure in these countries 
however  we cannot guarantee an increase in the demand for our products and services in developing countries or that customers in these countries will accept our products and services at all 
our ability to penetrate emerging markets in developing countries is dependent upon various factors including o the speed at which communications infrastructure  including terrestrial microwave  coaxial cable and fiber optic communications systems  which compete with satellite based services  is built  o the effectiveness of our local resellers and sales representatives in marketing and selling our products and services  and o the acceptance of our products and services by customers 
if our products and services are not accepted  or the market potential we anticipate does not develop  our revenues will be impaired 
we depend upon certain key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel  which would harm our business 
our future performance depends on the continued service of our key technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
in particular  we are highly dependent on our management team  including david hershberg  kenneth miller  marni ehrlich  burt liebowitz  steven yablonski and don woodring 
the employment of any of our key personnel could cease at any time 
our future success depends upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
because the competition for qualified employees among companies in the satellite communications industry and the networking industry is intense  we may not be successful in recruiting or retaining qualified personnel  which would harm our business 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may damage our business 
we regard our trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property as critical to our success 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may damage our business 
we rely on trademark  trade secret and patent protection and contracts including confidentiality and license agreements with our employees  customers  strategic collaborators  consultants and others to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization 
failure to maintain protection of all of our intellectual property for any reason could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
we currently have been granted two patents in the united states for remote access to the internet using satellites and for satellite communication with automatic frequency control 
we also have a patent pending in the united states 
we also intend to seek further patents on our technology  if appropriate 
we cannot assure you that patents will be issued for any of our pending or any future applications or that any claims allowed from such applications will be of sufficient scope  or be issued in all countries where our products and services can be sold  to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
also  our competitors may be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect our products and services or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products and services more likely 
we have filed applications for trademark registration of globecomm systems inc in the united states and various other countries and have received trademark registrations for netsat express in the united states  the european community  russia and brazil 
we intend to seek registration of other trademarks and service marks in the future 
we cannot assure you that registrations will be granted from any of our pending or future applications  or that any registrations that are granted will prevent others from using similar trademarks in connection with related goods and services 
defending against intellectual property infringement claims could be time consuming and expensive  and if we are not successful  could cause substantial expenses and disrupt our business 
we cannot be sure that the products  services  technologies  and advertising we employ in our business do not or will not infringe valid patents  trademarks  copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business 
we may incur substantial expenses in defending against these third party claims  regardless of their merit 
successful infringement claims against us may result in substantial monetary liability and or may materially disrupt the conduct of  or necessitate the cessation of that part of  our business 
through its ownership  our officers and directors and their affiliates may be able to exert substantial influence over our management 
as of september   our officers and directors  and their affiliates beneficially own approximately million shares  constituting approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  acting together  may be able to exert significant influence over the election of directors and other corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
we may not be able to keep pace with technological changes which would make our products and services become non competitive and obsolete 
the telecommunications industry  including satellite based communications services and internet access services  is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services in a timely manner or in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our products and services would become non competitive and obsolete  which would harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on our suppliers  some of which are our sole or a limited source of supply  and the loss of these suppliers would materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we currently obtain most of our critical components and services from single or limited sources and generally do not maintain significant inventories or have long term or exclusive supply contracts with our source vendors 
we have from time to time experienced delays in receiving products from vendors due to lack of availability  quality control or manufacturing problems  shortages of materials or components or product design difficulties 
we may experience delays in the future and replacement services or products may not be available when needed  or at all  or at commercially reasonable rates or prices 
if we were to change some of our vendors  we would have to perform additional testing procedures on the service or product supplied by the new vendors  which would prevent or delay the availability of our products and services 
furthermore  our costs could increase significantly if we need to change vendors 
if we do not get timely deliveries of quality products and services  or if there are significant increases in the prices of these products or services  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be unable to lease transponder space on satellites which could limit our ability to provide our services to our customers 
we and netsat express lease transponder space on satellites in order to provide communications and internet services to our customers and the customers of netsat express 
the supply of transponder space serving a geographic region on earth is limited by the number of satellites that are in orbit above that geographic region 
if companies that own and deploy satellites in orbit underestimate the demand for transponder space in a given geographic area or they are simply unable to build and launch enough satellites to keep up with increasing demand  the price for leasing transponder space could rise  increasing our cost of operations or we simply may not be able to lease enough transponder space to meet the demands of our customers 
we currently anticipate that the rapid growth in the demand for satellite based communications worldwide could lead to a short term shortage of transponder space 
we rely on netsat express  our majority owned subsidiary  for our main supply of transponder space on satellites 
if their business fails or we are otherwise unable to continue to rely on them for this supply  our business may be harmed 
we currently depend on netsat express for a majority of our transponder space on satellites 
we do not have a long term agreement in place with netsat express  as most of our needs are filled on a purchase order basis 
if netsat express is unable to develop its business or if we are unable to continue to rely on their supply for transponder space  then we will have to find alternative suppliers 
if we are unable to find another supplier of transponder space or if we are unable to find one on terms favorable to us  then our business may be harmed 
our network may experience security breaches which could disrupt our services 
our network infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  denial of service attacks and similar disruptive problems caused by our customers or other internet users 
computer viruses  break ins  denial of service attacks or other problems caused by third parties could lead to interruptions  delays or cessation in service to our customers 
there currently is no existing technology that provides absolute security  and the cost of minimizing these security breaches could be prohibitively expensive 
we may face liability to customers for such security breaches 
furthermore  these incidents could deter potential customers and adversely affect existing customer relationships 
satellites upon which we rely may be damaged or lost  or malfunction 
the damage  loss or malfunction of any of the satellites used by us  or a temporary or permanent malfunction of any of the satellites upon which we rely  would likely result in the interruption of our satellite based communications services 
this interruption would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
problems resulting from the year problem could result in a decrease in sales of our products and services or require us to redirect our resources 
prior to january   there was a great deal of concern regarding the ability of computers to adequately distinguish st century dates from th century dates due to the two digit date fields used by many systems 
most reports to date  however  are that computer systems are functioning normally and the compliance and remediation work accomplished leading up to was effective in preventing any problems 
computer experts have warned that there may still be residual consequences of the change in centuries and any such difficulties could result in a decrease in sales of our products and services  an increase in allocation of resources to address year problems of our customers without additional revenue commensurate with such dedication of resources  or an increase in litigation costs relating to losses suffered by our customers due to such year problems 
risks related to government approvals we are subject to many government regulations  and failure to comply with them will harm our business 
operations and use of satellites we are subject to various federal laws and regulations which may have negative effects on our business 
we operate federal communications commission  or fcc licensed earth stations in hauppauge  new york  subject to the communications act of  as amended the act  and the rules and regulations of fcc 
pursuant to the act and rules  we have obtained and are required to maintain radio transmission licenses from the fcc for both domestic and foreign operations of our earth stations 
these licenses should be renewed by the fcc in the normal course as long as we remain in compliance with fcc rules and regulations 
however  we cannot guarantee that additional licenses will be granted by the fcc when our existing licenses expire  nor are we assured that the fcc will not adopt new or modified technical requirements that will require us to incur expenditures to modify or upgrade our equipment as a condition of retaining our licenses 
we are also required to comply with fcc regulations regarding the exposure of humans to radio frequency radiation from our earth stations 
these regulations  as well as local land use regulations  restrict our freedom to choose where to locate our earth stations 
foreign ownership we may  in the future  be required to seek fcc approval for foreign ownership if we operate as a common carrier and ownership of our stock exceeds the specified criteria 
failure to comply with these policies may result in an order to divest the offending foreign ownership  fines  denial of license renewal  and or license revocation proceedings against the licensee by the fcc 
foreign regulations regulatory schemes in countries in which we may seek to provide our satellite delivered communication services may impose impediments on our operations 
some countries in which we intend to operate have telecommunications laws and regulations that do not currently contemplate technical advances in telecommunications technology like internet intranet transmission by satellite 
we cannot assure you that the present regulatory environment in any of those countries will not be changed in a manner which may have a material adverse impact on our business 
either we or our local partners typically must obtain authorization for each country in which we provide our satellite delivered data communications services 
the regulatory schemes in each country are different  and thus there may be instances of noncompliance of which we are not aware 
we cannot assure you that our licenses and approvals are or will remain sufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities  or that necessary licenses and approvals will be granted on a timely basis in all jurisdictions in which we wish to offer our products and services or that applicable restrictions will not be unduly burdensome 
regulation of the internet due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted at the local  national or international levels with respect to the internet  covering issues including user privacy and expression  pricing of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights  information security or the convergence of traditional communication services with internet communications 
it is anticipated that a substantial portion of our internet operations will be carried out in countries which may impose greater regulation of the content of information coming into the country than that which is generally applicable in the united states  for example  privacy regulations in europe and content restrictions in countries like the republic of china 
to the extent that we provide content as a part of our internet services  it will be subject to laws regulating content 
moreover  the adoption of laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for our internet services or increase our cost of doing business or in some other manner have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues including property ownership  copyrights and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel and personal privacy is uncertain 
the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes to these laws intended to address these issues  including some recently proposed changes  could create uncertainty in the marketplace which could reduce demand for our products and services  could increase our cost of doing business as a result of costs of litigation or increased product development costs  or could in some other manner have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
telecommunications taxation  support requirements  and access charges all telecommunications carriers providing domestic services in the united states are required to contribute a portion of their gross revenues for the support of universal telecommunications services  and some telecommunications services are subject to special taxation and to contribution requirements to support services to special groups  like persons with disabilities 
our services may be subject to new or increased taxes and contribution requirements that could affect our profitability  particularly if we are not able to pass them through to customers for either competitive or regulatory reasons 
internet services are currently exempt from charges that long distance telephone companies pay for access to the networks of local telephone companies in the united states 
efforts have been made from time to time  and may be made again in the future  to eliminate this exemption 
if these access charges are imposed on telephone lines used to reach internet service providers  and or if flat rate telephone services for internet access are eliminated or curtailed  the cost to customers who access our satellite facilities using telephone company provided facilities could increase to an extent that could discourage the demand for our services 
likewise  the demand for our services in other countries may be affected by the availability and cost of local telephone or other telecommunications facilities to reach our facilities 
export of telecommunications equipment the sale of our ground segment systems  networks  and communications services outside the united states is subject to compliance with the regulations of the united states export administration regulations 
the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  in order to ship our products into other countries  the products must satisfy the technical requirements of that particular country 
if we were unable to comply with these requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products  our sales in those countries could be restricted  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price is highly volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering  which was completed in august the market price for our common stock  like that of the securities of many telecommunications and high technology industry companies  is likely to remain volatile based on many factors  including the following o quarterly variations in operating results  o announcements of new technology  products or services by us or any of our competitors  o acceptance of satellite based communication services and internet access services in developing countries with emerging markets  o changes in financial estimates or recommendations by security analysts  or o general market conditions 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
litigation of this type is often extremely expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could significantly harm our business 
netsat express has announced its intentions to make an initial public offering of shares of its common stock 
because we own a large percentage of the shares of netsat express  an adverse change in the market price of netsat express common stock  whether or not it accurately reflects the financial performance or prospects of netsat express  may affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  any perceived delay or actual postponement of an initial public offering of netsat express common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we currently report in our consolidated financial statements the operations of netsat express 
the timing and size of netsat express anticipated offering is dependent on market conditions and other factors 
if netsat express completes its anticipated initial public offering  our equity ownership may decrease to a percentage that would cause us to no longer consolidate the financial position and results of operations of netsat express 
therefore  we may in the future report our financial statements without consolidating the financial statements of netsat express 
if public market analysts view this change in our financial statement reports negatively  it could have a material adverse affect on the market price of our stock 
a third party could be prevented from acquiring your shares of stock at a premium to the market price because of our anti takeover provisions 
various provisions with respect to votes in the election of directors  special meetings of stockholders  and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and section of the general corporation laws of the state of delaware could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so might be beneficial to you and our other stockholders 
in addition  we have a poison pill in place that could make an acquisition of us by a third party more difficult 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to certain purchases from foreign vendors 
in the normal course of business  we assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values 
our objective to managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rates for certain purchases from foreign vendors  if applicable 
accordingly  we utilize from time to time foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments denominated in foreign currency 
as of june   we had no such foreign currency forward contracts 
our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from its investment of available cash balances in money market funds with portfolios of investment grade corporate and government securities  and secondly  certain of its fixed long term capital lease agreements 
under our current positions  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
