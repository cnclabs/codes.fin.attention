overview we succeeded in to a business co founded in by john e 
bailye  the company s current chairman  president and chief executive officer 
the business was established to provide sales force effectiveness or sfe solutions that would enable companies to manage  coordinate and control the activities of large sales forces in complex selling environments  primarily in the prescription only pharmaceutical industry 
today  our solutions combine software products with a wide range of specialized support services 
these services include software implementation  technical and hardware support and sales force support 
we develop  implement and service sales force software products through our own sales  support and technical personnel located in offices worldwide 
we generate revenues from both services and licenses 
service revenues  which account for a substantial majority of our revenues  consist of fees from a wide variety of contracted services which we make available to our customers  generally under multi year contracts 
we generate implementation fees from services provided to configure and implement the sales force software products for our customers  sometimes as part of longer projects when enhancing customer relationships is our goal 
we receive technical and hardware support fees for services related to  among other things  ongoing technical support  maintenance of our customers databases  operations of our customers server computers  maintenance for our customers remote hardware and asset control 
technical and hardware support fees also include fees for software maintenance services such as software defect resolution and performance enhancements 
we charge fees for these maintenance services based on a percentage of total license fees plus configuration fees  if any 
we receive sales force support fees for organizing and managing support of our customers sales force  including training  telephone support and data analysis services 
ongoing support fees are generally negotiated at the commencement of a contract 
however  it is our experience that our larger customers increase the amount of services they purchase from us over time 
fees for these additional services are typically based on the labor and materials used to provide the applicable service 
we charge our customers license fees to use our proprietary computer software 
customers generally pay one time perpetual license fees based upon the number of users  the territory covered and the particular software licensed by the customer 
the company generally recognizes license fees as revenue using the percentage of completion method over a period of time that commences with the exceution of a license agreement and ends when the product configuration is complete and it is ready for use in the field 
this period of time usually includes initial customization or configuration and concludes with quality assurance and testing 
in those historically rare cases when there is no initial customization or configuration the company generally recognizes the license fees from those products upon delivery assuming any services to be provided are not essential to the functionality of the software 
additionally  license revenues will be recognized immediately when user count for previously delivered software increases and or a third party is used for implementation and configuration 
the company s software licensing agreements provide for a warranty period typically days from the date of excution of the agreement 
the portion of the license fee associated with the warranty period is unbundled from the license fee and is recognized ratably over the warranty period 
the company does not recognize any license fees unless persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the license amount is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable 
the united states  the united kingdom  france and japan are our main markets 
we generated approximately of our total revenues outside the united states during the year ended december   approximately during the year ended december   and approximately during the year ended december  we bill services provided by our foreign branches and subsidiaries in local currency 
license fees for our products are generally billed in us dollars regardless of where they originate 
foreign license fees are shown as united states revenues in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating results generated in local currencies are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rate in effect for the reporting period 
our operating profits by geographic segments are shown in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our geographic operating profits are affected primarily by our use of local technical and customer support personnel  costs associated with opening new facilities or expanding existing facilities and our ability to increase service revenues faster than the growth in selling  general and administrative expenses 
mergers and acquisitions we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire products or businesses that represent strategic enhancements to our operations 
such acquisition opportunities  if they arise  and are successfully completed  may involve the use of cash or equity instruments 
we currently have no agreements to make any acquisitions 
in accordance with this policy  the company has engaged in the following acquisitions over the last few years on july   the company acquired of the capital stock of associated business computing  nv and an affiliated company collectively  abc for approximately  and transaction costs of  the purchase was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  whereby the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities assumed of abc based on their respective fair market values at the acquisition date 
the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired was assigned to identifiable intangibles 
the company assigned  to in process research and development and such amount was written off in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the company also recorded  as goodwill 
abc s results of operations have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
on may   the company exchanged  shares of its common stock for all the outstanding shares of common stock of cornet international  ltd 
cornet  a provider of sales force effectiveness solutions for the us pharmaceutical  consumer and business to business markets 
the merger has been accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
accordingly  the company s financial statements have been restated to reflect the acquisition of cornet under the pooling of interests method 
on june   the company purchased all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities  as defined  of marketing management international  inc and certain affiliated companies collectively  mmi  providers of palm top software and paper based sales force effectiveness solutions and consulting services to subsidiaries of multinational pharmaceutical companies operating in emerging markets  such as latin america  eastern europe and southeast asia 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  mmi received  in cash  which includes estimated transaction costs  and  in dendrite common stock 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method with the purchase price allocated to the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities 
the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been allocated between capitalized software development costs and goodwill based upon an independent appraisal 
mmi s results of operations have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
on january   the company purchased all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities  as defined  of analytika  inc analytika  a provider of advanced analytical products  consulting services and outsourced operations services to the pharmaceutical industry 
the final purchase price was approximately  in dendrite common stock and assumed liabilities  with transaction costs of  the acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method with the purchase price allocated to the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities 
the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired will be allocated between capitalized software development costs and goodwill based upon an independent appraisal

operating income other income income before income taxes income taxes net income certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform with current year presentations 
during the second quarter of  we determined that costs associated with certain activities that were previously classified as research and development expense should be classified as cost of services as these expenditures relate to client specific activities 
for consistency of presentation  all prior periods have been reclassified 
years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues increased  to  in  up from  in license fee revenues increased  to  in  up from  in license fee revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in as compared to in this increase was attributable primarily to sales to new pharmaceutical customers  sales force expansions and software upgrades by existing pharmaceutical customers 
service revenues increased  to  in  up from  in service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in as compared to in the increase in the absolute dollar amount of service revenues was primarily the result of an increase in the number of installed users of dendrite sales force software products at both new and existing customers  as well as the provision of additional services for our existing customers 
the company expects the approximate current relationship of license to service revenues to continue in the future 
cost of revenues

as a percentage of service revenues however  cost of services decreased from of service revenues in to in this decrease was primarily the result of increased operational efficiencies in total gross margin for rose to  up from in this increase is due to the improvement in both service and license margins as described above  as well as the higher proportion of license to service revenues in this is due to the launch of several new products 
the company believes that the appropriate targeted gross margin rate should be between 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased  to  in  up from  in as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses remained constant at for the years ended and the increase in the absolute dollar amount of sg a expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenses from both our existing businesses and our newly acquired businesses  as well as increases related to additional leased facilities in morristown  new jersey 
the company s annual targeted sg a expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  are 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased  to  in up from  in the increase in research and development expenses during the most recent period was attributable primarily to increased spending on development of our laptop pharmaceutical sales force software products and a new version of our palmtop pharmaceutical sales force software product 
with respect to future research and development expenses  subject to market conditions  we currently anticipate that such expenses will be approximately to of revenues 
mergers and acquisitions 
during the second quarter  the company acquired cornet in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests and incurred a one time expense for the costs related to the acquisition and the cancellation of a proposed common stock offering 
write off of in process research and development costs

we assigned  to in process research and development and such amount was written off in the accompanying statement of operations for the three months ended september  provision for income taxes 
the effective rate decreased to in from in the effective rate for both the years ended december  and included one time charges  which are not deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the effect of these charges the effective rate would have been reduced to in from in this decrease was due to the continued implementation of tax planning strategies throughout the world 
years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues increased  to  in  up from  in license fee revenues increased  to  in  up from  in this increase was attributable primarily to the recognition of revenues related to license fees from several significant contracts in the pharmaceutical division  sales to new customers in our consumer business division and increased sales of third party software 
service revenues increased  to  in  up from  in this increase was primarily the result of an increase in our installed base of sales force software products for both new and existing customers  the commencement of major product rollouts  as well as the provision of additional services to our existing customers 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased  to  in  up from  in cost of license fees increased  to  in  up from  in in  the cost of license fees represents the amortization of capitalized costs of  and third party vendor license fees of  cost of license fees for represents the amortization of capitalized costs of  and third party vendor license fees of  the increase in the amortization of capitalized software development costs in was due to the increase in gross capitalized software development costs in as compared to the increase in third party vendor license fees in was attributable to the increase in third party software sales in cost of services increased  to  in  up from  in this increase was primarily due to an increase in staff required to support greater client activity including the use of higher cost consultants and contractors

sg a expenses increased  to  in up from  in this increase was primarily attributable to increased staff required for sales and support operations

research and development 
research and development expenses increased  to  in up from  in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses remained relatively constant at 
the increase in research and development expenses during the most recent period wasprimarily attributable to increased spending on development of our cpg products  the continued development of forcemultiplierx and the development of our next generation pharmaceutical sales force software product  forcepharma 
with respect to future research and development expenses  subject to market conditions  we currently anticipate that such expenses will be approximately to of total revenues 
write off of in process research and development costs 
we incurred a one time charge of  to record the write off of in process research and development costs resulting from the acquisition of abc 
this amount represents the estimated fair values  based on an independent appraisal  related to in process research and development projects which had not yet reached technological feasibility 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate  excluding the impact of the write off of in process research and development which is not tax deductible  decreased to for the year ended december  as opposed to during this decrease was due primarily to the implementation of tax minimization strategies throughout the world 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated statement of operations data expressed in us dollars for our eight most recently ended fiscal quarters

net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to higher net income and by the cash tax benefit provided from the exercise of stock options during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  cash used in investing activities was  in the year ended december   compared to cash used in investing activities of  in the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to increased purchases of short term investments as well as the purchase of abc in the year ended december  on january   our board of directors the board of directors or the board approved a stock buy back program initially limited to  which  subject to further board review and approval  could be increased to a maximum of  but not greater than of dendrite s outstanding shares of common stock 
during the twelve month period ending december   dendrite repurchased  shares of common stock for a value of  dendrite did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the year ending december  and we obtained  of cash from financing activities in the year ended december   compared to obtaining  in cash from financing activities in the year ended december  the change in our cash provided from financing activities was due to an increase in the issuance of common stock  primarily from the exercise of employee stock options during the year ended december  we maintain a million revolving line of credit agreement with the chase manhattan bank  na the agreement is available to finance working capital needs and possible future acquisitions 
the terms of this agreement require us to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth  among other covenants  measured quarterly  which is equal to our net worth as of december   plus of our net income earned after january  plus of the net proceeds to us of any equity offering 
this covenant effectively limits the amount of cash dividends we may pay 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the agreement and we satisfied all of our covenant obligations 
our working capital was approximately  at december  and  at december  we have no significant capital spending or purchasing commitments other than normal purchase commitments and commitments under facility and capital leases 
year readiness disclosure we spent approximately  to evaluate  test and remediate  if necessary  our internal computer software and operating systems  collectively  our internal programs and systems  for year compliance problems 
these costs were funded with cash from our operations and such costs were expensed or capitalized  depending on the nature of the expenditure 
since january   the company has not had any year related problems associated with its internal programs and systems or software products licensed to its customers  and is not aware of any year related problems associated with the systems or software of its vendors  distributors or suppliers 
although the company expects most material year compliance problems to have arisen or occurred on or after january   there can be no assurance  however  that the year problem will not adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that may affect future operating results our business is heavily dependent on the pharmaceutical industry most of our sales force software products and services are currently used in connection with the marketing and sale of prescription only drugs 
this market is undergoing a number of significant changes 
these include consolidations and mergers which may reduce the number of our existing and potential customers  also could alter implementation or purchase cycles  reclassification of formerly prescription only drugs to permit their over the counter sale  competitive pressures on our pharmaceutical customers resulting from the continuing shift to delivery of healthcare through managed care organizations  and changes in law  such as government mandated price reductions for prescription only drugs  that affect the healthcare systems in the countries where our customers and potential customers are located 
we cannot assure you that we can respond effectively to any or all of these and other changes in the marketplace 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly and may not meet market expectations our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to lengthy sales and implementation cycles for our products  our fixed expenses in relation to our fluctuating revenues and variations in our customers budget cycles  each of which is discussed below 
as a result  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance 
it is possible that in some future period our results of operations may be below the expectations of the public market analysts and investors 
if this happens  the price of our common stock may decline 
our lengthy sales and implementation cycles make it difficult to predict our quarterly revenues the selection of a sales force software product often entails an extended decision making process because of the strategic implications and substantial costs associated with a customer s license of the software 
given the importance of the decision  senior levels of management often are involved and  in some instances  the board of directors may be involved in this process 
as a result  the decision making process typically takes nine to eighteen months  although in some cases it may take even longer 
accordingly  we cannot control or predict the timing of our execution of contracts with customers 
in addition  an implementation process of three to six months is customary before the software is rolled out to a customer s sales force 
however  if a customer were to delay or extend its implementation process  our quarterly revenues may decline below expected levels and could adversely affect our results of operations 
our fixed costs may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results if revenues fall below expectations we establish our expenditure levels for product development  sales and marketing and some of our other operating expenses based in large part on our expected future revenues and anticipated competitive conditions 
in particular  we frequently add staff in advance of new business to permit adequate time for training 
if the new business is subsequently delayed or canceled  we will have incurred expenses without the associated revenues 
in addition  we may increase sales and marketing expenses if competitive pressures become greater than we currently anticipate 
since only a small portion of our expenses varies directly with our actual revenues  our operating results and profitability are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected if our revenues fall below expectations 
our business is affected by variations in our customers budget cycles we have historically realized a greater percentage of our license fees and service revenues in the second half of the year than in the first half because  among other things  our customers typically spend more of their annual budget authorization for sfe solutions in the second half of the year 
however  the relationship between the amounts spent in the first and second halves of a year may vary from year to year and from customer to customer 
in addition  changes in our customers budget authorizations may reduce the amount of revenues we receive from the license of additional software or the provision of additional services 
as a result  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we depend on a few major customers for a significant portion of our revenues we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers considering all affiliates of each customer as part of that customer 
approximately of our total revenues in came from pfizer and johnson johnson 
approximately of our total revenues in came from pfizer  johnson johnson and parke davis 
approximately of our total revenues in came from pfizer  johnson johnson and rhone poulenc rorer 
we believe that the costs to our customers of switching to a competitor s software product  or of taking significant system management functions in house  are substantial 
nevertheless  some of our customers have switched  and in the future  other customers may switch to software products and or services offered by our competitors or by in house staff 
if any of our major customers were to make such a change  our business  operating results or financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
we may be unable to successfully introduce new products or respond to technological change the market for crm products changes rapidly because of frequent improvements in computer hardware and software technology 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to use available technologies and data sources to develop new products and services and to enhance our current products and services  introduce new solutions that keep pace with developments in our target markets  and address the changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop and market new products or product enhancements that respond to technological advances in the marketplace  or that we will do so in a timely fashion 
we also cannot assure you that our products will adequately and competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace 
competition for software products has been characterized by shortening product cycles 
we may be materially and adversely affected by this trend if the product cycles for our products prove to be shorter than we anticipate 
if that happens  our business  operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 
to remain competitive  we also may have to spend more of our revenues on product research and development than we have in the past 
as a result  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
further  our software products are technologically complex and may contain previously undetected errors or failures 
such errors have occurred in the past and we cannot assure you that  despite our testing  our new products will be free from errors 
errors that result in losses or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for our products and services we believe there are eight other companies that sell sales force software products that specifically target the pharmaceutical industry  including three competitors that are actively selling sales force software products in more than one country  and two competitors that also offer sales force support services 
we believe the sales force software products and or services offered by most of our competitors do not address the variety of pharmaceutical and cpg customer needs that our solutions address 
however  these competing solutions may cost less than our solutions 
we also face competition from many vendors that market and sell sales force automation and crm solutions in the consumer packaged goods or cpg market 
in addition  we also compete with various companies that provide support services similar to our services 
we believe our ability to compete depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the number and success of new market entrants supplying competing sales force products or support services  expansion of product lines by  or consolidation among  our existing competitors  and development and or operation of in house sales force software products or services by our customers and potential customers 
some of our competitors and potential competitors are part of large corporate groups and have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  sales  marketing  technology and other resources than we have 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
some of our customers rely on our competitors for market data current market data on the sales of prescription only pharmaceutical products is an important element for the operation of our sales force software products in the prescription only pharmaceutical industry 
our customers use this data to guide and organize their sales forces and marketing efforts 
some of the leading purveyors of this market information compete with us either directly or through affiliates or may compete with us in the future 
if these purveyors of market information require pharmaceutical companies to use their sales force products and or services  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
our international operations have risks that our domestic operations do not the sale of our products and services in foreign countries accounts for  and is expected in the future to account for  a material part of our revenues 
these sales are subject to risks inherent in international business activities  including any adverse change in the political or economic environments in these countries  any adverse change in tax  tariff and trade or other regulations  the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights  exposure to exchange rate risk for service revenues which are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  and difficulties in managing an organization spread over various jurisdictions 
we may face risks associated with acquisitions our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions 
as part of our business strategy  we have acquired businesses that offer complementary products  services  or technologies 
these acquisitions are accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in an acquisition of a business  including the effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position  the failure of an acquired business to further our strategies  the difficulty of integrating the acquired business  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired business  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and the maintenance of uniform company wide standards  procedures and policies 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we expect that the consideration paid for future acquisitions  if any  could be in the form of cash  stock  rights to purchase a stock or a combination of these 
to the extent that we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock in connection with any future acquisition  existing shareholders will experience dilution and potentially decreased earnings per share 
our success depends on retaining our key senior management team and on attracting and retaining qualified personnel our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the contributions of our executive officers and key sales  technical and customer service personnel 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we have at times experienced difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel and we may experience such difficulties in the future 
any such difficulties could adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
our inability to manage our growth could adversely affect our business to manage our growth effectively we must continue to strengthen our operational  financial and management information systems and expand  train and manage our work force 
however  we may not be able to do so effectively or on a timely basis 
failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon our business  operating results or financial condition 
our business depends on proprietary technology that we may not be able to protect completely we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology 
we cannot assure you that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of this technology 
further  protective actions we have taken or will take in the future may not prevent competitors from developing products with features similar to our products 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we have  on occasion  in response to a request by our customer  entered into agreements which require us to place our source code in escrow to secure our service and maintenance obligations 
further  we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future that may result in the imposition of damages or injunctive relief against us 
in addition  any such claims may require us to enter into royalty arrangements 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
there are characteristics in the consumer packaged goods market that differ from the pharmaceutical market 
we market and sell crm solutions to companies in the cpg market 
the selling environment in this market has unique characteristics that differentiate it from the pharmaceutical market 
in addition  we believe that the cpg market is composed of sub markets  each of which may have unique characteristics 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to replicate in this market the success we have achieved in the ethical pharmaceutical market 
provisions of our charter documents and new jersey law may discourage an acquisition of dendrite provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  our by laws and new jersey law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
for example  the board of directors may  without the consent of the stockholders  issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock 
our common stock may be subject to price fluctuations the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors the announcement or the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results and changes in earnings estimates by analysts  market conditions in the technology  healthcare and other growth sectors  and general consolidation in the healthcare information industry which may result in the market perceiving us or other comparable companies as potential acquisition targets 
further  the stock market has experienced on occasion extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the equity securities of many technology companies have been especially volatile and often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk because we have operations in a number of countries and our service agreements in such countries are denominated in a foreign currency  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as currency rates change  translation of the income statements of our international entities from local currencies to us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge translation risks because we generally reinvest the cash flows from international operations 
management estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating profit by less than  this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one area may be offset by gains from another area 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union took place on january  the eleven participating countries will issue sovereign debt exclusively in euro and will redenominate outstanding sovereign debt 
the legal currencies will continue to be used as legal tender through january   at which point the legacy currencies will be canceled and euro bills and coins will be used for cash transactions in the participating countries 
there can be no assurance that such euro conversion will not adversely effect our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we have not determined what impact  if any  the euro has on our foreign exchange exposure 
interest rate risk we earn interest income from our larger balances of cash and short term investments 
this interest income is subject to market risk related to changes in interest rates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of investment 
as of december   our investments consisted primarily of commercial paper maturing over the following three months 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that if the average yield of the company s investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by less than  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact of future changes in investment yields on our future interest income will depend largely on the gross amount of our investments
