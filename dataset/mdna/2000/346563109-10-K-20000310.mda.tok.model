we are a leading independent internet research firm that conducts research and analysis on the impact of the internet and emerging technologies on business strategy  consumer behavior and society 
our clients  which include senior management  business strategists and marketing and technology professionals within large enterprises use our prescriptive  actionable research to understand and capitalize on the internet and emerging business models and technologies 
we derive revenues from memberships to our core research and from our advisory services and forum events 
we offer contracts for our products and services that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
research revenues are recognized pro rata on a monthly basis over the term of the contract 
our advisory services clients purchase such services together with memberships to our research 
billings attributable to advisory services are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when performed 
similarly  forum billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized upon completion of each event 
our operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment  selling and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization

selling and marketing expenses include salaries  employee benefits  travel expenses  promotional costs  sales commissions and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the operations  technology  finance and strategy groups and our other administrative functions

this renewal rate is not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base

results of quarterly operations the following tables set forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly operating results for each of our eight most recently ended fiscal quarters 
we have derived this information from our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements  which  in the opinion of our management  have been prepared on a basis consistent with our financial statements contained elsewhere in this prospectus and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus 
historically  our total revenues  operating profit and net income in the fourth quarter have reflected the significant positive contribution of revenues attributable to advisory services performed and forum events held in the fourth quarter

memberships for research  which constituted approximately of our revenues for the year ended december   are generally annually renewable and are payable in advance 
we generated million and million in cash from operating activities during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we used million of cash in investing activities  consisting primarily of million for net purchases of property and equipment  million for a minority investment in an internet based marketing research firm and million for net purchases of marketable securities 
we regularly invest excess funds in short and intermediate term interest bearing obligations of investment grade 
we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of marketable securities at december  we do not have a line of credit and do not anticipate the need for one in the foreseeable future 
we plan to continue to introduce new products and services and to invest in our infrastructure over the next months 
we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balances and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital  financing activities and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next two years 
year readiness disclosure as of the date of this filing  we have not incurred any significant business disruptions as a result of year issues 
however  while no such occurrence has developed  year issues that may arise related to key suppliers and service providers may not become apparent immediately 
we have received assurances of year compliance from key suppliers 
we have also received assurances from key service providers such as financial institutions  our payroll service provider and our retirement plan administrator as to their year readiness 
we can provide no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by these suppliers and service providers due to noncompliance in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of corporate obligations  federal agency obligations  state and municipal bonds and treasury notes with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair market value of these investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
principal amounts by expected maturity in us dollars in thousands except interest rates year ending fair value at year ending year ending december  december  december  december  and thereafter cash equivalents   weighted average interest rate investments     weighted average interest rate total portfolio     weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange 
on a global level  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposure had been related to non dollar denominated operating expenses in europe  canada and asia  where we sell primarily in us dollars 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union took place in our fiscal year we have not determined what impact  if any  the euro will have on foreign exchange exposure 
we are prepared to hedge against fluctuations the euro will have on foreign exchange exposure if this exposure becomes material 
as of december   the total assets related to non dollar denominated currencies was approximately million
