item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  future  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appear throughout the form k and are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily with respect to our operations and related industry developments 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described in the section of this item titled additional factors that may affect future results  and elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part i  item of this form k 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing therapeutic and diagnostic products for applications in oncology  drug discovery and regenerative medicine 
our product development programs are based upon three patented  independent and synergistic technologies telomerase  human pluripotent stem cells and nuclear transfer 
since inception  substantially all of our revenues have been generated from license and research agreements with collaborators 
in addition  we receive license payments and royalties from license and marketing agreement with various diagnostic and research tool collaborators 
we recognize revenue from the license and research agreements with collaborators as the related research and development costs are incurred under the collaborative agreements 
in march  we sold a total of  shares of our common stock and  warrants to purchase our common stock to a single investor for million 
we structured the sale of securities in two parts 
we priced the first million of common stock at per share  and  warrants are exercisable at per share 
we priced the remaining million of common stock at per share  and the remaining  warrants are exercisable at per share 
the common stock and the stock underlying the warrants are not registered for resale and are subject to a two year prohibition on sale by agreement 
as of march   all of the warrants were outstanding 
in january  we extended our three way license and research collaboration agreement with kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn 
the agreement extends the research and compound selection periods by one additional year to march and provides for additional research funding over the next two years 
in may  we completed the acquisition of roslin bio med ltd  a privately held company formed by the roslin institute in midlothian  scotland 
as part of the acquisition  we formed a research collaboration with the roslin institute which obligated us to provide million in research funding over the next six years which has a net present value of million 
in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of roslin bio med  we issued  shares of our common stock with a fair value of million 
in addition  in exchange for the outstanding fully vested stock options in roslin bio med  we issued fully vested options to purchase  shares our common stock with a fair value of million 
the total purchase price of million also included acquisition costs of million 
under the terms of the agreement  roslin bio med became our wholly owned united kingdom subsidiary and is known as geron bio med 
we accounted for the transaction using the purchase method 
we allocated the purchase price between the acquired basic research in the form of a license in the nuclear transfer technology  the research agreement with the roslin institute and the net tangible assets of roslin bio med 
we expensed the value of the nuclear transfer technology of million as acquired research expense and capitalized the value of the research agreement of million as an intangible asset and are amortizing this asset over the next six years 
on september   we sold million series c convertible two percent coupon debentures and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to an institutional investor 
the debentures are convertible at any time by the holder at a fixed conversion price of per share 
the debentures convert at our option when our common stock has traded at a specified premium to the fixed conversion price for ten consecutive trading days 
the warrants to purchase  shares of common stock are exercisable at per share and the warrants to purchase  shares of common stock are exercisable at per share at the option of the holder until june  our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future based upon the timing and composition of funding under our various collaborative agreements  as well as the progress of our research and development efforts and variations in the level of expenses related to developmental efforts during any given period 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon our collaborative partners  enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights  need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of regulatory approvals or clearances 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic products for a period of years  if at all 
results of operations revenues we recognized revenues from collaborative agreements of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal revenues in and represented research support payments from our collaborative agreements with kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn 
declining revenues in and were a result of reduced research funding from kyowa hakko as contractually agreed in revenues in also included a one time payment by boehringer mannheim for reimbursement of past research efforts 
we recognize revenue under collaboration agreements as we incur the related research and development costs 
we received annual funding payments of million and million under the kyowa hakko agreement in and  respectively 
we did not receive any funding payments from kyowa hakko in we received funding payments totaling million each in fiscal and under the pharmacia upjohn agreement 
we expect revenues from collaborative agreements to increase in as compared to as a result of the renewed research commitments from kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn 
as a result of the extensions  these agreements provide for additional funding from kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn over the next two years 
we receive license payments and royalties from license and marketing agreements with various diagnostic and research tool collaborators 
we received a license fee payment of  in under our product marketing agreement with clontech 
we did not receive any license fee payments in or in fiscal  we received  in royalties on the sale of diagnostic kits to the research use only market from intergen  kyowa medex  roche diagnostics and pharmingen compared to  received in fiscal in  we also recognized  in shared profits from sales of cell based research products from clontech 
sales of these cell based research products began in september research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and the increase in from was primarily the result of the amortization of the research funding obligation to the roslin institute of million  increased license fees for research technology of million and increased personnel related costs of  the increase in from was primarily a result of increased personnel costs of  for additional scientific staff 
we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly in the future as a result of the continued development of our therapeutic and diagnostic programs 
acquired research expenses acquired research expenses were the result of the acquisition of roslin bio med in may we used the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated the purchase price between the acquired basic research in the form of a license to the nuclear transfer technology  the research agreement with the roslin institute and the net tangible assets of roslin bio med 
we expensed the value of the nuclear transfer technology of million as acquired research expense and capitalized the value of the research agreement of million as an intangible asset 
the total purchase price of million also included acquisition costs of million 
the license to the nuclear transfer technology was the only significant asset of roslin bio med 
we intend to enhance the research and development of the nuclear transfer technology by combining it with our other technology platforms 
before we can enter into clinical trials for a potential commercial application  we must expand the research and development of the combined technology platforms 
future products  if any  may take several years to develop and commercialize and will require substantial additional funds 
we may never be able to create a commercial product from the nuclear transfer technology 
although we have the right to sublicense the nuclear transfer technology  we expect any future collaborations or sublicenses to fund future research and development and not recover the cost of the basic nuclear transfer technology that we acquired 
we are using this technology for one research project 
we have concluded that this technology has no alternative future use  and accordingly  have expensed the value of the acquired research technology at the time of the acquisition 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily the result of increased business consulting expenses of  increased personnel related costs of  increased facilities maintenance costs of  and increased legal and accounting expenses of  the increase in from was primarily a result of increased personnel costs of approximately  for additional administrative personnel and bonus accruals 
in addition  expenses in also reflected increases in public and investor relations expense  legal  accounting and consulting fees  supplies and expensed office equipment and other taxes and filing fees 
interest and other income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in and was due to higher average cash and investment balances as a result of the sale of debt and equity securities in interest earned in the future will depend on any future funding cycles and prevailing interest rates 
we also received million   and  in research payments under government grants for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect income from government grants to decrease in the future 
interest and other expense interest and other expense was million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest and other expense in over was primarily the result of the various convertible debenture financings during in connection with the issuance of million of series b convertible debentures in june  we recorded approximately  in interest expense for the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date of signing and the conversion price of the debentures 
when we issued the series c convertible debentures  we did not have sufficient authorized common shares to permit the series c convertible debenture holder to fully convert the series c convertible debentures and exercise the warrants 
if we did not obtain stockholder approval to increase our authorized common shares to allow for the full conversion of the series c convertible debentures and exercise of series c warrants prior to march   we would have been in default under the debenture and would have been obligated to redeem the debentures at the request of the series c convertible debenture holder at the greater of of the principal amount of the debentures or an amount equal to the fair value of our common stock the debentures would have been converted into plus expenses 
in december  we obtained the necessary stockholder approval to issue additional shares of common stock in order for the holder of the series c convertible debentures to convert their shares into our common stock and exercise their warrants 
prior to obtaining stockholder approval to increase the number of authorized common shares  we recognized  of interest expense related to the potential penalty on redemption up through the date our stockholders authorized the additional shares to be issued 
on the date of issuance of the series c convertible debentures  we recorded approximately  in interest expense for the difference between the fair value of our common stock on september  and the conversion price of the debentures 
we determined the value of the warrants to be  in accordance with emerging issue task force issue no 
 which was effective for transactions with a commitment date after may   we recorded this value as an increase to additional paid in capital with a related charge to interest expense 
we recorded this amount at the time when our stockholders approved the increase to the number of our authorized common shares to an amount sufficient to allow for the full conversion of the series c convertible debentures and exercise of the series c warrants 
interest and other expense in also included approximately  of imputed interest for the accretion of our research funding obligation to the roslin institute 
in december  we recorded approximately  in interest expense in connection with the sale of series a convertible debentures  for the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the date of issuance and the conversion price of the series a convertible debentures 
we recorded the series a convertible debentures at a discount and were amortizing the debentures to the redemption amount prior to the conversion of the debentures into common stock 
net loss net losses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in net loss for was primarily the result of the charge for acquired research technology in connection with the acquisition of roslin bio med and the amortization of the research funding obligation to the roslin institute 
the increase in net loss for was primarily the result of increased operating expenses during the year and lower research support payments from kyowa hakko 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  were million compared to million at december  and million at december  we have an investment policy to invest these funds in liquid  investment grade securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  corporate notes  commercial paper and municipal securities 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments in was primarily the result of the sale of convertible debentures in june and september the increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments in was the result of sale of our convertible preferred stock in march and our sale of convertible debentures in december net cash used in operations was million in and million in cash used in operations in was primarily the result of the net loss for the year of million offset partially by non cash charges including purchased research technology expense of million 
we expect that our net cash used in operations will increase in as a result of increased research and development expenditures 
through december   we have invested approximately million in property and equipment  of which approximately million was financed through equipment financing 
minimum annual payments due under the equipment financing facility are expected to total million    and  in   and  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately million available for borrowing from our equipment financing facility 
the drawdown period under the equipment financing facility expires on july  we intend to renew the commitment for a new equipment financing facility in to further fund equipment purchases 
if we are unable to renew the commitment  then we will need to spend our own resources for equipment purchases 
we have agreed to fund scientific research at academic and research institutions 
under these research arrangements  we are obligated to make minimum annual payments of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
we also formed a research collaboration agreement with the roslin institute  which obligated us to provide approximately million in research funding over the next six years of which million was paid in we intend to continue to maintain and develop relationships with academic and research institutions 
in and  pharmacia upjohn made equity investments in our common stock totaling million at a premium 
in  pharmacia upjohn and kyowa hakko both extended their research funding commitment for an additional year 
we expect to receive additional funding from pharmacia upjohn in each of the next two years to fund our future development efforts 
we also expect to receive additional funding from kyowa hakko over the next two years 
we will seek further funding through other strategic collaborations  public or private equity financing  or other financing sources 
in march  we completed a private placement with two institutional investors for the sale of  shares of series a preferred stock with a stated value of  per share resulting in proceeds of million 
in november   shares of series a convertible preferred stock converted into  shares of our common stock and in april  we redeemed the remaining  shares of series a preferred stock for million 
the total redemption value included the premium on the outstanding book value of the series a preferred stock 
as of december   no shares of series a preferred stock remained outstanding 
in december  we sold million in convertible zero coupon debentures and warrants to purchase  shares our common stock to investment funds managed by three institutional investors 
we received one half of the proceeds upon signing the agreement which resulted in the issuance of million series a convertible debentures and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
during  all of the series a convertible debentures converted into  shares of our common stock at per share 
as of december   none of series a warrants had been exercised 
in june  we sold million of our series b convertible debentures and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock 
the series b debentures are convertible at any time by the holders at a fixed conversion price of per share 
the series b warrants are exercisable at per share by the holders of series b convertible debentures 
as of december   million of the principal amount of the series b convertible debentures were outstanding 
as of december   none of the series b warrants had been exercised 
in september  we sold million in series c convertible two percent coupon debentures and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to an institutional investor 
the debentures are convertible at any time by the holder at a fixed conversion price of per share 
we can convert the debentures when the our common stock has traded at a certain premium to the fixed conversion price for ten consecutive trading days 
the warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock are exercisable at per share and the warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock are exercisable at per share 
we determined the value of the warrants to be approximately million and recorded this amount as interest expense 
as of december   all of the series c convertible debentures were outstanding 
as of december   none of the series c warrants had been exercised 
as of march   the remainder of principal of the series b convertible debentures have been converted into  shares of our common stock and approximately million of principal of the series c convertible debentures have been converted into approximately  shares of our common stock 
as of march   institutional investors have exercised series a warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  series b warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock and series c warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
we received total proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of these warrants 
in march  we sold a total of  shares of our common stock and  warrants to purchase our common stock to a single investor for million 
we structured the sale of securities in two parts 
we priced the first million of common stock at per share  and  warrants are exercisable at per share 
we priced the remaining million of common stock at per share  and the remaining  warrants are exercisable at per share 
the common stock and the stock underlying the warrants are not registered for resale and are subject to a two year prohibition on sale by agreement 
as of march   all of the warrants were outstanding 
we estimate that our existing capital resources  payments expected to be made under the kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn collaborative agreements  interest income and equipment financing will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through june changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may not result in the expenditure of available resources before such time  and in any event  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in the future 
we intend to seek additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  capital lease transactions or other financing sources that may be available 
year computer systems compliance all of our computer hardware and software has been upgraded for year compliance 
all of our key vendors have provided assurance that they are year compliant 
while there were no year related problems at the transaction in the year  we are maintaining our contingency plans in the event any problems arise in the future 
the statement contained in the foregoing year readiness disclosures is subject to protection under year information and readiness disclosure act 
additional factors that may affect future results before you invest in our common stock  you should be aware that there are various risks  including those described below 
you should carefully consider these risk factors  together with all of the other information included in this form k  before you decide whether to purchase shares of our common stock 
any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
this document contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should not rely on these forward looking statements 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  plans expect  future  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appear throughout the document and are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily with respect to our operations and related industry developments 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described in the preceding pages and elsewhere in this document 
our business is at an early stage of development and we may not develop any products that reach clinical trials the study of the mechanisms of cellular aging and cellular immortality  including telomere biology and telomerase  the study of human pluripotent stem cells  and the process of nuclear transfer are relatively new areas of research 
our business is at an early stage of development 
we have not yet produced any products that have progressed to clinical trials and we may never do so 
our ability to produce products that progress to clinical trials is subject to our ability to  among other things continue to have success with our research and development efforts  select therapeutic compounds for development  obtain the required regulatory approvals  and manufacture and market resulting products 
if and when potential lead drug compounds or product candidates are identified through our research programs  they will require significant preclinical and clinical testing prior to regulatory approval in the united states and elsewhere 
in addition  we will also need to determine whether any of these potential products can be manufactured in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost 
our efforts may not result in a product that can be marketed 
because of the significant scientific  regulatory and commercial milestones that must be reached for any of our research programs to be successful  any program may be abandoned  even after significant resources have been expended 
we have a history of operating losses and anticipate future losses  continued losses could impair our ability to sustain operations we have incurred net operating losses every year since our operations began in as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over the next several years as our research and development efforts and preclinical testing activities are expanded 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been research support payments under the collaboration agreements with kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn 
the agreements provide that through  kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn will provide additional funding 
we may be unsuccessful in entering into any new corporate collaboration that results in revenues 
even if we are able to obtain new collaboration arrangements with third parties the revenues generated from these arrangements will be insufficient to continue or expand our research activities and otherwise sustain our operations 
we are unable to estimate at this time the level of revenue to be received from the sale of diagnostic products  and do not currently expect to receive significant revenues from the sale of research use only kits 
our ability to continue or expand our research activities and otherwise sustain our operations is dependent on our ability  alone or with others to  among other things  manufacture and market therapeutic products 
we may never receive material revenues from product sales or that such revenues  if any  will be sufficient to continue or expand our research activities and otherwise sustain our operations 
we will need additional capital to conduct our operations and develop our products  and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain we will require substantial capital resources in order to conduct our operations and develop our products 
while we estimate that our existing capital resources  payments under the kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn collaborative agreements  interest income and equipment financing will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through june  we cannot guarantee that this will be the case 
the timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for our capital needs in and beyond  continued scientific progress in our research and development programs  the magnitude and scope of our research and development programs  our ability to maintain and establish strategic arrangements for research  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing  our progress with preclinical and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  and the potential for new technologies and products 
we intend to acquire additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings and capital lease transactions 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
additional equity financings could result in significant dilution to stockholders 
further  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners  these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
if sufficient capital is not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our inability to identify an effective inhibitor for telomerase may prevent us from developing a viable cancer treatment product  which would adversely impact our future business prospects as a result of our drug discovery efforts to date  we have identified compounds in laboratory studies that demonstrate potential for inhibiting telomerase in humans 
however  additional development efforts will be required before we select a lead compound for preclinical development and clinical trials as a telomerase inhibitor for cancer 
we will have to conduct additional research before we can select a compound and we may never identify a compound that will enable us to fully develop a commercially viable treatment for cancer 
if  and when selected  a lead compound may prove to have undesirable and unintended side effects or other characteristics affecting its safety or effectiveness that may prevent or limit its commercial use 
in terms of safety  our discoveries may result in cancer treatment solutions that cause unacceptable side effects for the human body 
our discoveries may also not be as effective as is necessary to market a commercially viable product for the treatment of cancer 
as a result  telomerase inhibition may need to be used in conjunction with other cancer therapies 
accordingly  it may become extremely difficult for us to proceed with preclinical and clinical development  to obtain regulatory approval or to market a telomerase inhibitor for the treatment of cancer 
if we abandon our research for cancer treatment for any of these reasons or for other reasons  our business prospects would be materially and adversely affected 
if our access to necessary tissue samples  information or licensed technologies is restricted  we will not be able to develop our business to continue the research and development of our therapeutic and diagnostic products  we need access to normal and diseased human and other tissue samples  other biological materials and related clinical and other information 
we compete with many other companies for these materials and information 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain access to these materials and information on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  government regulation in the united states and foreign countries could result in restricted access to  or prohibiting the use of  human and other tissue samples 
if we lose access to sufficient numbers or sources of tissue samples  or if tighter restrictions are imposed on our use of the information generated from tissue samples  our business will be materially harmed 
some of our competitors may develop technologies that are superior to or more cost effective than ours  which may impact the commercial viability of our technologies and which may significantly damage our ability to sustain operations the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive 
we believe that other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in efforts related to the biological mechanisms of cell aging and cell immortality  including the study of telomeres  telomerase  human pluripotent stem cells  and nuclear transfer 
in addition  other products and therapies that could compete directly with the products that we are seeking to develop and market currently exist or are being developed by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and by academic and other research organizations 
many companies are also developing alternative therapies to treat cancer and  in this regard  are competitors of ours 
many of the pharmaceutical companies developing and marketing these competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical testing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing 
smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research  clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 
there is also competition for access to libraries of compounds to use for screening 
should we fail to secure and maintain access to sufficiently broad libraries of compounds for screening potential targets  our business would be materially harmed 
in addition to the above factors  we expect to face competition in the following areas product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory consents  availability of resources  reimbursement coverage  price  and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions of others 
as a result of the foregoing  our competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products  or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than us 
most significantly  competitive products may render the products that we develop obsolete 
the ethical  legal and social implications of our research using pluripotent stem cells and nuclear transfer could prevent us from developing or gaining acceptance for commercially viable products in this area our programs in regenerative medicine may involve the use of human pluripotent stem cells that would be derived from human embryonic or fetal tissue 
the use of human pluripotent stem cells gives rise to ethical  legal and social issues regarding the appropriate use of these cells 
in the event that our research related to human pluripotent stem cells becomes the subject of adverse commentary or publicity  the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed 
some groups have voiced opposition to our technology and practices 
the concepts of cell regeneration  cell immortality  and genetic cloning have stimulated significant ethnical debates in both the social and political arenas 
we use hpscs derived through a process that uses either donated embryos that are no longer necessary following a successful in vitro fertilization procedure or donated fetal material as the starting material 
further  many research institutions  including some of our scientific collaborators  have adopted policies regarding the ethical use of human embryonic and fetal tissue 
these policies may have the effect of limiting the scope of research conducted using hpscs  resulting in reduced scientific progress 
in addition  the united states government and its agencies currently do not fund research which involves the use of human embryonic tissue and may in the future regulate or otherwise restrict or prohibit the public or private use of human embryonic or fetal tissue 
our inability to conduct research using hpscs due to such factors as government regulation or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on us 
finally we acquired roslin bio med to gain the rights to nuclear transfer technology 
the roslin institute produced dolly the sheep in the first mammal cloned from an adult cell in history 
geron acquired exclusive rights to this technology for all areas except human cloning and certain other limited applications 
although we will not be pursuing human reproductive cloning  all of the techniques we continue to develop for use in agricultural cloning and our nuclear transfer work for organ regeneration are directly applicable to human cloning should some other group in the future decide to pursue this avenue 
negative associations with any or all of these practices could harm our ability to establish critical partnerships and collaborations  prompt government regulation of our technologies  cause delays in our research and development  and cause a decrease in the price of our stock 
also  if regulatory bodies were to ban nuclear transfer processes  our research using nuclear transfer technology could be cancelled and our business could be significantly harmed 
public attitudes towards of gene therapy may negatively affect regulatory approval or public perception of our products the commercial success of our product candidates will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of gene therapies for the prevention or treatment of human diseases 
public attitudes may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe  and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community 
adverse events in the field of gene therapy that have occurred or may occur in the future also may result in greater governmental regulation of our product candidates and potential regulatory delays relating to the testing or approval of our product candidates 
negative public reaction to gene therapy in the development of certain of our therapies could result in greater government regulation  stricter clinical trial oversight  commercial product labeling requirements of gene therapies and could cause a decrease in the demand for any products that we may develop 
the subject of genetically modified organisms has received negative publicity in europe  which has aroused public debate 
the adverse publicity in europe could lead to greater regulation and trade restrictions on imports of genetically altered products 
if similar adverse public reaction occurs in the united states  genetic research and resultant products could be subject to greater domestic regulation and could cause a decrease in the demand for our potential products 
even if we reach clinical trials with one or more of our products  they may not result in any commercially viable products we do not expect to generate any significant revenues from product sales for a period of several years 
we may never generate revenues from product sales or become profitable because of a variety of risks inherent in our business  including risks that clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products  completion of clinical trials may be delayed  or costs of clinical trials may exceed anticipated amounts  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our products  or may experience delays in obtaining such approvals  we may not be able to manufacture our drugs economically on a commercial scale  we and our licensees may not be able to successfully market our products  physicians may not prescribe our products  or patients may not accept such products  others may have proprietary rights which prevent us from marketing our products  and competitors may sell similar  superior or lower cost products 
impairment of our intellectual property rights may limit our ability to pursue the development of our intended technologies and products our success will depend on our ability to obtain and enforce patents for our discoveries  however  legal principles in the united states and in other countries for biotechnology patents are not firmly established and the extent to which we will be able to obtain patent coverage is uncertain 
protection of our proprietary compounds and technology is critically important to our business 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce our patents and maintain trade secrets  both in the united states and in other countries 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  including ours  are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and technical questions for which legal principles are not firmly established 
we may not continue to develop products or processes that are patentable  and it is possible that patents will not issue from any of our pending applications  including allowed patent applications 
further  our current patents  or patents that issue on pending applications  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and our current or future patent rights may not provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in obtaining and enforcing patents  our business would be negatively impacted 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue 
publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by at least several months and sometimes several years 
therefore  the persons or entities that we or our licensors name as inventors in our patents and patent applications may not have been the first to invent the inventions disclosed in the patent applications or patents  or file patent applications for these inventions 
as a result  we may not be able to obtain patents from discoveries that we otherwise would consider patentable and that we consider to be extremely significant to our future success 
patent prosecution or litigation may also be necessary to obtain patents  enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of another 
we may not be successful in any patent prosecution or litigation 
patent prosecution and litigation in general can be extremely expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
an adverse outcome in a patent prosecution  litigation or any other proceeding in a court or patent office could subject our business to significant liabilities to other parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from other parties or require us to cease using the disputed technology 
we may be subject to infringement claims that are costly to defend  and which may limit our ability to use disputed technologies and prevent us from pursuing research and development or commercialization of potential products our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of others 
our technologies may infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
in addition  we may become aware of discoveries and technology controlled by third parties that are advantageous to our research programs 
in the event our technologies do infringe on the rights of others or we require the use of discoveries and technology controlled by third parties  we may be prevented from pursuing research  development or commercialization of potential products or may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or other proprietary rights or develop or obtain alternative technologies 
we may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain the necessary licenses or alternative technologies  we may be delayed or prevented from pursuing the development of some potential products 
our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain alternative technologies or a license to any technology that we may require to develop or commercialize our products will significantly and negatively affect our business 
patent law relating to the scope and enforceability of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving  and the degree of future protection for any of our proprietary rights is highly uncertain 
in this regard  patents may not issue from any of our patent applications 
as a result  our success may become dependent on our ability to obtain licenses for using the patented discoveries of others 
we are aware of patent applications and patents that have been filed by others with respect to our technologies and we may have to obtain licenses to use these technologies 
moreover  other patent applications may be granted priority over patent applications that we or any of our licensors have filed 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies  duplicate any of our technologies or design around the patented technologies we have developed 
in the event that we are unable to acquire licenses to critical technologies that we cannot patent ourselves  we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop similar technology  and we may not be successful in this regard 
if we cannot acquire or develop the necessary technology  we may be prevented from pursuing some of our business objectives 
moreover  one of our competitors could acquire or license the necessary technology 
any of these events could materially harm our business 
we may be subject to claims or litigation as a result of entering into license agreements with third parties or infringing on the patents of others 
for example  we signed a licensing and sponsored research agreement relating to our research relating to pluripotent stem cells with the johns hopkins university school of medicine in august prior to signing this agreement  we had been informed by a third party that we and johns hopkins university would violate the rights of that third party and another academic institution in doing so 
after a review of the correspondence with the third party and johns hopkins university  as well as related documents  including an issued united states patent  we believe that both we and johns hopkins university have substantial defenses to any claims that might be asserted by the third party 
we have agreed to provide indemnification to johns hopkins university relating to potential claims 
however  any litigation resulting from this matter may divert significant resources  both financial and otherwise  from our research programs 
we may be unsuccessful if the matter is litigated 
if the outcome of litigation is unfavorable to us  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
much of the information and know how that is critical to our business is not patentable and we may not be able to prevent others from obtaining this information and establishing competitive enterprises we rely extensively on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology  especially in circumstances in which patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or obtainable 
we attempt to protect our proprietary technology in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and contractors 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors  any of which would harm our business significantly 
some of our patents and patent applications relating to telomerase may be subject to challenge or be suspended by the united states patent and trademark office  which could jeopardize our ability to commercialize telomerase products our patents and patent applications relating to telomerase are critically important to our development and commercialization of therapeutic and diagnostic products for applications in oncology and regenerative medicine 
we have a number of patent applications pending relating to the cloned telomerase protein and its uses 
patent applications respecting the human telomerase protein and related gene applications are pending in several countries and patent prosecution is ongoing 
although we have been granted patents in the united kingdom and switzerland  we have received rejections in certain other countries and we may be unable to overcome those rejections or any others that we may encounter 
the united states patent and trademark office has advised us that the claims of two of our united states patent applications relating to cloned human telomerase are allowable  but that further prosecution of these applications has been suspended pending a determination of whether the initiation of an interference proceeding is appropriate to ascertain who made the claimed inventions first 
we believe this event indicates  among other things  that the patent and trademark office has established that at least one other entity has filed a united states patent application also claiming cloned human telomerase protein or its uses 
as a result  one or more interferences could be declared  in which case the united states patent and trademark office would undertake a multi year process to decide who made the underlying invention or inventions first 
if an interference is declared one result is that another entity could be awarded the patents 
we have prepared for an interference proceeding and  based on the information presently available to us  we believe that we cloned human telomerase protein prior to any other entity 
however  we do not yet have access to other entities invention records or their patent application files  which are maintained in secrecy by the united states patent and trademark office 
we  therefore  do not have access to all pertinent information for this analysis 
moreover  as interferences are typically complex  highly contested legal proceedings subject to appeal  accurately predicting an outcome is not possible  particularly at this stage 
an interference would divert significant resources  both financial and otherwise  from our research programs 
if interferences or other challenges to our patents are not resolved promptly in our favor  our existing business relationships could be jeopardized and we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing telomerase products  which could materially harm our business 
we depend on our collaborators to help us complete the process of developing and testing our products and our ability to develop and commercialize products may be impaired or delayed if our collaborative partnerships are unsuccessful our strategy for the development  clinical testing and commercialization of our products requires entering into collaborations with corporate partners  licensors  licensees and others 
we are dependent upon the subsequent success of these other parties in performing their respective responsibilities and the continued cooperation of our partners 
our collaborators may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them 
we cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators resources that will be devoted to our research activities related to our collaborative agreements with them 
our collaborators may choose to pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
our ability to successfully develop and commercialize telomerase inhibition products depends on our corporate alliances with kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn  and our ability to successfully develop and commercialize telomerase diagnostic products depends on our corporate alliance with roche diagnostics 
under our collaborative agreements with these collaborators  we rely significantly on them  among other activities  to design and conduct advanced clinical trials in the event that we reach clinical trials  fund research and development activities with us  pay us fees upon the achievement of milestones  and co promote with us any commercial products that result from our collaborations 
the development and commercialization of products from these collaborations will be delayed if kyowa hakko  pharmacia upjohn or roche diagnostics fail to conduct these collaborative activities in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  kyowa hakko  pharmacia upjohn or roche diagnostics could terminate these agreements and we may not receive any development or milestone payments 
if we do not receive research funds or achieve milestones set forth in the agreements  or if kyowa hakko  pharmacia upjohn or roche diagnostics or any of our future collaborators breach or terminate collaborative agreements with us  our business may be materially harmed 
our reliance on the research activities of our non employee scientific advisors and other research institutions  whose activities are not wholly within our control  may lead to delays in technological developments we rely extensively and have relationships with scientific advisors at academic and other institutions  some of whom conduct research at our request 
these scientific advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
we have limited control over the activities of these advisors and  except as otherwise required by our collaboration and consulting agreements  can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities 
if our scientific advisors are unable or refuse to contribute to the development of any of our potential discoveries  our ability to generate significant advances in our technologies will be significantly harmed 
in addition  we have formed research collaborations with many academic and other research institutions throughout the world  including the roslin institute 
these research facilities may have commitments to other commercial and non commercial entities 
we have limited control over the operations of these laboratories and can expect only limited amounts of time to be dedicated to our research goals 
unexpected costs and other difficulties arising from our acquisition of roslin bio med ltd 
and simultaneous research collaboration with the roslin institute may drain human and financial resources  or otherwise negatively affect our operations in may  we acquired roslin bio med  a private company located in scotland which was established by the roslin institute to develop nuclear transfer technology 
our acquisition of roslin bio med and formation of a research collaboration with the roslin institute have expanded the scope of our business and operations 
as a result  we may be presented with operational issues that we have not previously faced as a company  but which generally accompany acquisitions and research collaborations of this nature  including the potential disruption of ongoing business and distraction of management  unanticipated expenses related to technology and research integration  and the difficulty of implementing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies 
we may not be able to overcome any of these obstacles  and our failure to do so could prevent us from achieving the perceived benefits of the acquisition and collaboration and negatively impact our research activities and results of operations 
in addition  our agreement with the roslin institute obligated us to provide approximately million in development funding 
if we are unable to fulfill this significant obligation  the roslin institute could terminate the agreement and we would lose our rights to the technology 
the acquisition of roslin bio med has subjected us to the uncertainty inherent in international operations  and we have limited experience with international operations to date  we have only limited experience in managing operations internationally 
our acquisition of roslin bio med represents our first experience in managing international operations 
as a result of our international expansion  we are now subject to the uncertainties inherent in international operations  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with international laws  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations including those that arise as a result of distance  language and cultural differences  currency exchange rate fluctuations  political instability  export restrictions  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
one or more of these factors could materially harm our future international operations  the success of our acquisition of roslin bio med and  consequently  our business  operating results  and financial condition 
similarly  our collaborations with international partners such as the roslin institute  pharmacia upjohn  kyowa hakko and roche diagnostics could also subject us to the above described international uncertainties 
the loss of key personnel could slow our ability to conduct research and develop products our future success depends to a significant extent on the skills  experience and efforts of our executive officers and key members of our scientific staff 
competition for personnel is intense and we may be unable to retain our current personnel or attract or assimilate other highly qualified management and scientific personnel in the future 
the loss of any or all of these individuals could harm our business and might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of research  development or business objectives 
we also rely on consultants and advisors  including the members of our scientific advisory board  who assist us in formulating our research and development strategy 
we face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic and other research institutions 
we may not be able to attract and retain these individuals on acceptable terms 
failure to do so would materially harm our business 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities in order to protect ourselves against product liability claims our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic and diagnostic products 
we may become subject to product liability claims if the use of our products is alleged to have injured subjects or patients 
this risk exists for products tested in human clinical trials as well as products that are sold commercially we currently have no clinical trial liability insurance and we may not be able to obtain and maintain this type of insurance for any of our clinical trials 
in addition  product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive 
as a result  we may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on us 
because we or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the united states and foreign jurisdictions  we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our products federal  state and local governments in the united states and governments in other countries have significant regulations in place that govern many of our activities 
the preclinical testing and clinical trials of the products that we develop ourselves or that our collaborators develop are subject to intense government regulation and may prevent us from creating commercially viable products from our discoveries 
in addition  the sale by us or our collaborators of any commercially viable product will be subject to government regulation from several standpoints  including the processes of manufacturing  advertising and promoting  selling and marketing  labeling  and distributing 
we may not obtain regulatory approval for the products we develop or that our collaborators will obtain regulatory approval for the products they develop 
regulatory approval may also entail limitations on the indicated uses of a proposed product 
because certain of our product candidates involve the application of new technologies and may be based upon a new therapeutic approach  such products may be subject to substantial additional review by various government regulatory authorities  and  as a result  we may obtain regulatory approvals for such products more slowly than for products based upon more conventional technologies 
if  and to the extent that  we are unable to comply with these regulations  our ability to earn revenues will be materially and negatively impacted 
the regulatory process  particularly for biopharmaceutical products like ours  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any product that we or our collaborative partners develop must receive all relevant regulatory agency approvals or clearances  if any  before it may be marketed in the united states or other countries 
generally  biological drugs and non biological drugs are regulated more rigorously than medical devices 
in particular  human pharmaceutical therapeutic products  including a telomerase inhibitor  are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other requirements by the food and drug administration in the united states and similar health authorities in foreign countries 
the regulatory process  which includes extensive preclinical testing and clinical trials of each product in order to establish its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory agency approvals or clearances 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development and or the period of review of any application for regulatory agency approval or clearance for a product 
delays in obtaining regulatory agency approvals or clearances could significantly harm the marketing of any products that we or our collaborators develop  impose costly procedures upon our activities or the activities of our collaborators  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our collaborative partners may attain  or adversely affect our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
even if we commit the time and resources  both economic and otherwise  that are necessary  the required regulatory agency approvals or clearances may not be obtained for any products developed by or in collaboration with us 
if regulatory agency approval or clearance for a new product is obtained  this approval or clearance may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed that could limit the potential commercial use of the product 
furthermore  approved products and their manufacturers are subject to continual review  and discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or its manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in severe civil and criminal penalties  including but not limited to recall or seizure of products  injunction against manufacture  distribution  sales and marketing  and criminal prosecution 
the imposition of any of these penalties could significantly impair our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to be successful  our products must be accepted by the health care community that can be very slow to adopt or unreceptive to new technologies and products our products and those developed by our collaborative partners  if approved for marketing  may not achieve market acceptance since physicians  patients or the medical community in general may decide not to accept and utilize these products 
the products that we are attempting to develop may represent substantial departures from established treatment methods and will compete with a number of traditional drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies 
the degree of market acceptance of any of our developed products will depend on a number of factors  including our establishment and demonstration to the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of our product candidates  our ability to create products that are superior to alternatives currently on the market  our ability to establish in the medical community the potential advantage of our treatments over alternative treatment methods  and reimbursement policies of government and third party payors 
if the health care community does not accept our products for any of the foregoing reasons  or for any other reason  our business would be materially harmed 
the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products is uncertain and failure to obtain reimbursement approval could severely limit the use of our products significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  including pharmaceuticals 
if we fail to generate adequate third party reimbursement for the users of our potential products and treatments  then we may be unable to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our products  if any  will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors  examples of which include government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations  and pharmacy benefit management companies 
both federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means 
legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals and other medical products may change or be adopted before any of our potential products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we may develop in the future 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services and any of our potential products and treatments may ultimately not be considered cost effective by these third parties 
any of these initiatives or developments could materially harm our business 
our activities involve hazardous materials and improper handling of these materials by our employees or agents could expose us to significant legal and financial penalties our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
as a consequence  we are subject to numerous environmental and safety laws and regulations  including those governing laboratory procedures  exposure to blood borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations and may be adversely affected by the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations 
although we believe that our safety procedures for using  handling  storing and disposing of hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  our use of these materials could be curtailed by state or federal authorities and we could be liable for any civil damages that result  the cost of which could be substantial 
further  any failure by us to control the use  disposal  removal or storage of  or to adequately restrict the discharge of  or assist in the cleanup of  hazardous chemicals or hazardous  infectious or toxic substances could subject us to significant liabilities  including joint and several liability under certain statutes  and any liability could exceed our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  an accident could damage our research and manufacturing facilities and operations 
additional federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting us may be adopted in the future 
we may incur substantial costs to comply with and substantial fines or penalties if we violate any of these laws or regulations 
our stock price has historically been very volatile  which may make it more difficult for you to resell shares when you want at prices you find attractive stock prices and trading volumes for many biopharmaceutical companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons  including some reasons which may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations such as media coverage  legislation and regulatory measures and the activities of various protest groups or organizations 
this market volatility  as well as general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions  could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and your return on your investment 
historically  our stock price has been extremely volatile 
between january and december   our stock has traded as high as per share and as low as per share 
the significant market price fluctuations of our common stock are due to a variety of factors  including depth of the market for the common stock  the experimental nature of our prospective products  fluctuations in our operating results  market conditions relating to the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries  any announcements of technological innovations  new commercial products or clinical progress or lack thereof by us  our collaborative partners or our competitors  or announcements concerning regulatory developments  developments with respect to proprietary rights and our collaborations 
in addition  the stock market is subject to other factors outside our control that can cause extreme price and volume fluctuations 
securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies  including many biotechnology companies  which then experience volatility in the market price of their securities 
litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 
the sale of a substantial number of shares  including shares that will become eligible for sale in the near future  may adversely affect the market price for our common stock sales of substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could significantly and negatively affect the market price for our common stock 
as of march   we had approximately  shares of common stock outstanding 
of these shares  approximately  shares were issued including shares issuable upon conversion or exercise of convertible notes or warrants since december pursuant to private placements 
of these shares  approximately  shares have been registered pursuant to shelf registration statements and therefore may be resold if not sold prior to the date hereof in the public market and approximately  of the remaining shares may be resold pursuant to rule into the public markets as early as march  upon the expiration of a lockup agreement with us 
our undesignated preferred stock may inhibit potential acquisition bids  this may adversely affect the market price for our common stock and the voting rights of the holders of common stock our certificate of incorporation provides our board of directors with the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of these shares without further vote or action by the stockholders 
as of the date of this form k  the board of directors still has authority to designate and issue up to  shares of preferred stock 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders 
as a result  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
the issuance of preferred stock may also result in the loss of voting control by others 
provisions in our charter and bylaws  and provisions of delaware law  may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us  which may prevent holders of our common stock from benefitting from what they believe may be the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers in addition to the undesignated preferred stock  provisions of our charter documents and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management  including provisions that prevent stockholders from taking actions by written consent  divide the board of directors into separate classes with terms of office that are structured to prevent all of the directors from being elected in any one year  and set forth procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders meetings 
provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations 
either collectively or individually  these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefitting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers  including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about geron s market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the fair value of the our available for sale securities at december  was million 
these investments include million of cash and cash equivalents which are due in less than days  million of short term investments which are due in less than one year and million in long term investments which are due in one to two years 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we diversify the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
we primarily invest our marketable securities portfolio in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
due to the nature of our investments  which are primarily corporate and municipal notes and money market funds  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk 
because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our international subsidiary satisfies its financial obligations almost exclusively in its local currencies 
for the fiscal year end  there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
however  the financial obligations of geron to the roslin institute are stated in british pounds sterling over the next six years 
this obligation may become more expensive for us if the united states dollar becomes weaker against the british pounds sterling 
as of december   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
