item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial highlights and selected financial ratios and the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general on april   floridafirst bank reorganized from a mutual savings association into a mutual holding company named floridafirst bancorp mhc and formed floridafirst bancorp  a middle tier holding company  whereby floridafirst bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of floridafirst bancorp 
in connection with the reorganization  floridafirst bancorp sold  shares of its common stock to the public and the remaining  shares were held by floridafirst bancorp mhc 
on december   floridafirst bancorp  inc the company completed its stock offering in connection with the conversion and reorganization of floridafirst bank the bank and its holding company  floridafirst bancorp  from the mutual holding company form of organization to a full stock company 
as part of the conversion and reorganization  the shares formerly held by floridafirst bancorp mhc were cancelled  the company sold  new shares to the public and the shares held by stockholders of floridafirst bancorp were exchanged for  shares of the company 
the conversion and reorganization will be accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests  whereby the assets and liabilities of floridafirst bancorp will become the company s assets and liabilities 
forward looking statements the following discussions contain forward looking statements that are based on assumptions and describe future plans  strategies  and expectations of the bank and the company 
these forward looking statements are generally identified by use of the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  or similar expressions 
the company s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company and its subsidiaries include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  legislative regulatory changes  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve board  the quality and composition of the loan and investment portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in the company s market area  and changes in relevant accounting principles 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
the company does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions after the date of the statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
business strategy the board of directors and management have developed expansion plans that includes three de novo retail sales offices within its existing market areas and deployment of a strategic plan 
by seeking to broaden the range of its products and services offered  the company believes its strategies will offset the declining margins in the competitive market for one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the strategic plan includes o increasing the percentage of higher yielding and more interest sensitive assets  o increasing the percentage of commercial and consumer loans and commercial deposit accounts  among other products  o increasing alternative sources of cash at reasonable rates  o increasing sources of non interest income  o installing a new customer delivery software to enhance the sales efforts  o upgrading our computer network for enhanced service and security features  and o investigation of alternative delivery systems  including an internet banking solution and enhanced call center strategy 
the company is leasing one of the new retail sales offices and has purchased land to construct buildings for two offices 
the estimated capital expenditures for all three locations  including land  building and equipment are million 
one location will have excess office space that will be leased to other tenants 
the second location has excess land that will be sold after the company determines the actual land needed for the office 
highlights of the business strategy are as follows community oriented institution 
based on total assets  the bank is the largest independent financial institution headquartered in polk county  florida 
the bank is committed to meeting the financial needs of the communities in which it operates 
management believes that the bank is large enough to provide a full range of personal and business financial services  and yet is small enough to provide such services in a personalized and efficient manner 
the bank has recently added several convenience services to enhance its capabilities as a full service community bank  including the issuance of debit cards and placing automated teller machines at all of the branches 
it is the bank s current plan to deliver the products and services that meet the needs of its customers  including internet banking 
market focus 
the bank continues to review all opportunities that may benefit its business in its current market areas 
in and  the bank will open a total of three de novo branches in polk and manatee counties  florida 
see comparison of operating results for the years ended september  and september  other expenses 
commercial banking 
the bank continues to expand its lending programs for commercial business and commercial real estate loans in an effort to satisfy a perceived need within its market area and increase its loan portfolio 
the bank continues to realize a positive impact on its net interest margin since commercial customers generally provide a higher loan yield and a source of lower cost funds 
the risks of commercial lending relate to the source of repayment of the loan which is weighted toward the ability to repay versus being primarily collateral dependent 
in  the bank hired a senior commercial loan officer to head up the lending and credit activities and two additional commercial loan staff members were added to support its increased activities in this area 
to further enhance its transition to a full service community bank  the bank recently hired two additional lenders experienced in commercial lending and plans to increase its marketing efforts on smaller businesses operating in its market areas 
management of interest rate risk and market risk qualitative analysis 
because the majority of the company assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates  its most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk  or changes in interest rates 
the company is vulnerable to an increase in interest rates to the extent that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more rapidly than interest earning assets 
its lending activities have historically emphasized the origination of long term  fixed rate loans secured by single family residences 
the primary source of funds has been deposits with substantially shorter maturities 
while having interest bearing liabilities that reprice more frequently than interest earning assets is generally beneficial to net interest income during a period of declining interest rates  such an asset liability mismatch is generally detrimental during periods of rising interest rates 
the board of directors has established an asset liability committee that consists of the company s president and senior banking officers 
the committee meets on a monthly basis to review loan and deposit pricing and production volumes  interest rate risk analysis  liquidity and borrowing needs  and a variety of other asset and liability management issues 
to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income  the company has adopted various strategies to improve the matching of interest earning asset maturities to interest bearing liability maturities 
the principal elements of these strategies include o the origination of commercial and consumer loans with adjustable rate features or fixed rate loans with shorter term maturities  o lengthening the maturities of liabilities when deemed cost effective through the pricing and promotion of certificates of deposit and utilization of federal home loan bank advances  o attracting low cost checking and transaction accounts which tend to be less sensitive to rising rates  and o when market conditions permit  to originate and hold in its portfolio adjustable rate mortgage loans which have periodic interest rate adjustments 
the company also maintains an investment portfolio that provides a stable cash flow  thereby providing investable funds in varying interest rate cycles 
the company has also made a significant effort to maintain its level of lower cost deposits as a method of enhancing profitability 
at september   the company had of its deposits in savings  checking and money market accounts 
these deposits have traditionally remained relatively stable and are expected to be only moderately affected in a period of rising interest rates 
this stability has enabled the company to offset the impact of rising rates in other deposit accounts 
quantitative analysis 
exposure to interest rate risk is actively monitored by management 
the company s objective is to maintain a consistent level of profitability within acceptable risk tolerances across a broad range of potential interest rate environments 
the company uses the ots net portfolio value npv model to monitor its exposure to interest rate risk  which calculates changes in npv 
the npv model measures interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in the npv of cash flow from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the npv model shows the degree to which balance sheet line items and npv are potentially affected by a to basis point change 
one basis point equals th of a percentage point 
reports generated by the npv model are reviewed by the asset liability management committee and reported to the board of directors quarterly 
the npv model uses an option based pricing approach to value one to four family mortgages  mortgages serviced by or for others  and firm commitments to buy  sell  or originate mortgages 
this approach makes use of an interest rate simulation program to generate numerous random interest rate paths that  in conjunction with a prepayment model  are used to estimate mortgage cash flows 
prepayment options and interest rate caps and floors contained in mortgages and mortgage related securities introduce significant uncertainty in estimating the timing of cash flows for these instruments that warrants the use of this sophisticated methodology 
all other financial instruments are valued using a static discounted cash flow method 
under this approach  the present value is determined by discounting the cash flows the instrument is expected to generate by the yields currently available to investors from an instrument of comparable risk and duration 
future interest rates and their effects on npv and net interest income are not predictable 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  prepayments  and deposit run offs  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in such computations 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturity or periods of repricing  they may react at different times and in different degrees to changes in the market interest rates 
the interest rate on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  generally have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
after a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in making calculations set forth above 
additionally  an increased credit risk may result if our borrowers are unable to meet their repayment obligations as interest rates increase 
the following table presents our npv as of september  the npv was calculated by the ots  based upon the above model assumptions and financial information provided by the company 
as illustrated in the table  the calculations show that the company would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and favorably affected by decreases in interest rates 
npv as of present net portfolio value npv value of assets change basis point in rates amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp the ots defines the sensitivity measure as the change in npv ratio with a basis point shock 
our sensitivity measure reflects a basis point decline in npv ratio as of september  compared to a sensitivity measure of basis points as of september  the decline in our sensitivity measure at september  primarily reflects the significant increase in short term borrowing interest rates from september  see business of floridafirst bank borrowings 
our strategies for addressing the sensitivity measure indicators are as follows o reviewing the average lives and durations of our loans and investment securities  o reviewing deposit offerings and alternative funding sources to better match the durations of the assets  o providing an additional capital contribution from the company to the bank  and o performing  on a quarterly basis  a business simulation that more clearly reflects an on going business assumption  rather than relying solely on the ots model which more closely approximates a liquidation value model 
comparison of financial condition at september  and september  assets 
total assets increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the increase in total assets resulted primarily from an million  or a annualized increase in the loan portfolio attributable to steady loan demand in our market areas  a slow down in loan prepayments and funding of construction loans 
in addition  investment securities increased million 
management plans to focus on loan growth to effectively leverage its capital 
the capital leveraging strategy will include the purchase of investment securities to complement its loan origination efforts 
premises and equipment increased million primarily due to the purchase of a tract of land for million and capital expenditures to implement the initial phases of the strategic technology plan 
the tract of land contains over four acres 
after the determination of the land needed for a branch site  plans call for the sale of the excess land to recoup a substantial portion of the original investment 
the million increase in our investment in fhlb stock is directly attributable to our increased utilization of fhlb advances for funding purposes 
other assets increased primarily due to the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance policies that were purchased in january liabilities 
total liabilities increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the increase in total liabilities resulted primarily from a million net increase in fhlb advances utilized to fund the asset growth and a net deposit increase of million 
the increase in deposits in the last half of the year reflects renewed consumer interest in competitively priced certificates of deposit due to the increase in short term interest rates 
checking and money market accounts continue to grow through expansion of our customer base 
management continues to evaluate the available funding sources 
the attributes of the alternative funding sources that management considers in its analysis include the interest and other costs of such funding  the maturity considerations and the nature and characteristics of assets being funded 
stockholders equity 
net income for the year ended september  increased stockholders equity by million  however  the decrease in stockholders equity for the year reflects o repurchase of  shares of the company s stock at a cost of million  o repurchase of  shares of the company s stock for the restricted stock plan at a cost of  less shares issued at a cost of approximately o repayment of  on the esop loan  and o dividends paid that totaled  comparison of financial condition at september  and assets 
total assets increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the increase in total assets resulted primarily from a million increase in net loans outstanding from new originations  an increase in investments available for sale portfolio of million due to a financial leveraging strategy implemented after the issuance of stock  a reduction in investments held to maturity of million due to the maturity and calls of securities  and an increase in federal home loan bank stock of million 
liabilities 
total liabilities increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the increase in total liabilities resulted primarily from a million increase in federal home loan bank advances  a million increase in other borrowings  and a million net outflow in deposits 
the increase in the federal home loan bank advances and other borrowings utilized to fund the loan and investment growth was attributable to o the decision to not offer premium pricing on deposits to customers without other banking relationships  o disintermediation of customer funds due to alternative investment opportunities  and o management s decision to financially leverage the higher level of capital of the company to increase earnings 
deposits  excluding the million decrease in certificate of account balances  grew million  or  during the year 
stockholders equity 
the million increase in the stockholders equity reflects the million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  million in net offering proceeds reduced by the million in stock held by the employee stock ownership plan that has not been allocated to the participants  million in net income for the year ended september  and a net reduction in equity of million resulting from the decline in value of the company s investments available for sale portfolio 
the decline in value of the investments is directly attributable to the significant rise in interest rates during the second half of the fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources the liquidity of a savings institution reflects its ability to provide funds to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits  and to take advantage of market opportunities 
funding loan requests  providing for liability outflows  and managing interest rate fluctuations require continuous analysis in order to match the maturities of short term loans and investments with specific types of deposits and borrowings 
an institution s liquidity is normally considered in terms of the nature and mix of the institution s sources and uses of funds 
assets providing liquidity are generated through loan repayments and the management of maturity distributions for loans and securities 
an important aspect of liquidity management lies in maintaining sufficient levels of loans and mortgage backed securities that generate monthly cash flows 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million for the year ended september  significant cash flows or uses amounts shown in parentheses were as follows in millions cash provided by operations federal home loan bank advances and other borrowings increase in net deposits maturities of and repayments on investment securities net purchases of investment securities and fhlb stock net increase in loans purchase of bank owned life insurance payments to acquire treasury stock and restricted stock plan shares other net net increase in cash and cash equivalents the company is subject to federal regulations that impose certain minimum capital requirements 
for a discussion on such capital levels  see note in the consolidated financial statements 
except for the new capital generated through the second step mutual holding company conversion see note in the consolidated financial statements  management is not aware of any known trends  events or uncertainties that will have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital or operations nor is management aware of any current recommendation by regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
analysis of net interest income historically  the company s earnings have depended primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its loans and investments interest earning assets and interest paid on its deposits and any borrowed funds interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by o the interest rate spread the difference between rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities  and o the aggregate amounts of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
average balance sheet 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company for the periods indicated 
the average yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods presented 
similar information is provided as of september  average balances are derived from month end balances 
management does not believe that the use of month end balances instead of average daily balances has caused any material differences in the information presented

includes interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions and fhlb stock 
includes noninterest bearing checking accounts 
interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net margin on interest earning assets represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
interest income and net interest income do not agree to the consolidated statement of earnings because the tax equivalent income based on effective tax rate of on municipal bonds is included in this schedule 
rate volume analysis 
the relationship between the volume and rates of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities affects the company s net interest income 
the following table reflects the sensitivity of the company s interest income and interest expense to changes in volume and in prevailing interest rates during the periods indicated 
each category reflects the changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by old rate  changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by old volume  and net change 
the net change attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate has been allocated proportionally to the absolute dollar amounts of change in each

interest income 
the following discussion highlights the major factors that impacted the changes in interest income during the year ended september  when compared to the prior year 
details are contained in the table at page o loan growth reflects the strong loan demand over the past year and the company s increased emphasis on loan origination efforts 
o the yield on loans decreased slightly due to the competitive pricing for commercial and consumer loans in our market areas 
although new mortgage loan rates increased throughout most of the year  about of the company s new originations were construction loans that were not fully disbursed during the year 
in addition  construction loans that were originated in when mortgage loan rates were lower were funded during the result of the timing on the construction loan disbursements kept the yields on mortgage loans from increasing in relation to the overall increase in mortgage loan pricing 
o the average balances in the investment securities portfolio grew primarily due to the company s strategy to leverage capital that was raised in the stock offering 
o the higher yield in the investment portfolio resulted from the leveraging strategy in the latter part of fiscal and throughout fiscal when rates had risen significantly over the prior year 
in addition  the investment growth occurred in securities that had slightly longer average lives with higher yields 
interest expense 
the following discussion highlights the major factors that impacted the changes in interest expense during the year ended september  when compared to the prior year 
detailed changes are contained in the table at page o deposits remained fairly level primarily by maintaining a conservative deposit pricing strategy  utilizing more cost effective funding alternatives that are available for the terms the company has considered appropriate to fit its interest rate management strategies 
this was offset however  by special promotions to increase certificate accounts 
the growth in checking account average balances has helped offset the slight decline in certificate accounts 
o fhlb advances grew because the company considered the advances to be a more cost effective funding alternative during the course of the year 
although the costs of the advances exceed the cost of certificate accounts  funding asset growth through certificate accounts was deemed to be more expensive than wholesale funding 
o the higher cost of funds related to the fhlb advances is reflective of the significant rise in interest rates over the past year 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is charged to operations to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that represents management s best estimates of the losses inherent in the portfolio  based on historical experience  volume and type of lending conducted by the company  industry standards  the level and status of past due and non performing loans  the general economic conditions in the company s lending area and other factors affecting the collectibility of the loans in its portfolio 
for the year ended september   the provision for loan losses was  compared to  for the comparable period 
the allowance for loan losses at september  increased  from september  though our non performing loans decreased  for the period  our classified assets increased slightly and our commercial and consumer loans increased in the aggregate of approximately million from september  such increases in classified loans and commercial and consumer loans precipitated the increase in the provision for loan losses 
see  business of floridafirst bank lending activities and classified assets 
other expenses 
other expense increased by  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the major components of the increase was due to the following o compensation and employee benefits increased  due primarily to an approximate increase in staffing and annual salary adjustments and recognition of  related to the restricted stock plan 
o other expenses increased by  primarily due to the following o certain year costs totalling  o direct costs related to stockholder meetings  communications  legal matters and new financial reporting requirements as a public company totalling  o increased effort on charging off uncollected fees and overdrawn accounts totalling  o accelerated vesting of restricted stock due to the death of a director totalling  o offsetting the increase in other expenses was a decrease of o occupancy and equipment costs of  primarily due to the elimination of franchise taxes previously accrued in property taxes  and o federal insurance premiums of  due to the decrease in premium rates by the fdic on january  the board of directors and management have developed expansion plans that includes three de novo branches within our existing market areas and deployment of a strategic technology plan 
the strategic technology plan includes o installing a new customer delivery software to enhance the sales efforts  o enhancing both our data and voice communications systems  o upgrading our computer network for enhanced service and security features  o implementing internal and external networks to improve communications and productivity  and o investigation of alternative delivery systems  including an internet banking solution and enhanced call center strategy 
a summary of the estimated costs associated with the new projects follows in thousands estimated costs estimated costs category fiscal fiscal new branches new computer hardware and software other costs related to strategic technology plan total   the board of directors and management analyzed the potential effect of each of these expenditures prior to approval and believe that these expenditures will have an overall positive effect on the company s franchise and stockholder value  but also realize that the expenditures will most likely depress profitability ratios in the short term 
the company also expects that both net interest income and fee income will increase as a result of the new branches and new technology enhancements 
however  it is not possible to precisely estimate such revenue increases  if any  at this time 
the success of new projects is dependent upon a number of factors  including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  regulatory climate  interest rates and the success of the company s marketing efforts 
comparison of operating results for years ended september  and september net income 
net income for the year ended september  increased to million  compared to million for the year ended september  o net interest income increased to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  this increase resulted from an increase in interest income of  and a decrease in interest expense of million 
o other income decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   resulting primarily from a million gain from the sale of certain deposits and branch buildings  as further discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
o other expenses decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this decrease is due primarily to million in charges resulting from the freezing of benefits under the defined benefit pension plan million  and the adoption of a directors retirement plan  as further discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
total interest income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   as a result of an increase in average interest earning assets offset to some extent by a decrease in the average interest rates earned 
average interest earning assets increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   an increase resulting from strong loan growth throughout the year 
the average rate earned on interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september   a decrease of basis points 
interest income on loans increased million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this increase reflects the strong loan growth in all areas mortgage  consumer and commercial loans 
total loan originations were million in compared to million in  a increase in origination volume 
the strong originations were offset by substantial repayments and refinance activity 
also  the branch sale at the end of january reduced the loan portfolio by million  meaning that results had income on these loans for four months of the year 
in addition  the average yield on loans decreased by basis points during the year  reflecting the general downward trend in interest rates for the first half of the fiscal year 
mortgage loan rates began to increase late in the year  but the competitive pressures in the consumer and commercial markets kept rates lower for the entire year in when compared to interest income on investment securities and other investments decreased  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in the average balance to million in from million in the decrease in the average balance of investment securities was due primarily to the maturities and calls of certain securities and the redeployment of these funds into loans 
the decrease in average balances was partially offset by an increase in the average yield by basis points through the diversification of the portfolio  extension of maturities  reduction in interest earning deposit accounts and a rising interest rate environment during the last half of the year 
interest expense 
total interest expense decreased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   as a result of a basis point decrease in average cost of funds and a million decrease in the average interest bearing liabilities 
average interest bearing liabilities decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the average cost for interest bearing liabilities was for the year ended september  compared to 
for the year ended september   a decrease of basis points 
the decrease in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities reflects market rates as well as the replacement of higher cost certificates of deposit with federal home loan bank advances and lower cost checking and money market accounts 
interest expense on deposits decreased million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was a result of a decrease of million in the average balance of interest bearing deposits to million in from million in and a decrease of basis points in the average cost of deposits to in from in the company began using federal home loan bank advances in june to control its cost of funds and lengthen the maturity of its liabilities 
the company manages the maturity of its advances based on the assets being funded and based on projections of interest rate trends and has used the federal home loan bank advances as a major funding source due to the ability to manage the maturities  the cost effectiveness in executing the transactions and the level of interest rates offered compared to alternative funding sources 
the average costs of advances in was which compares favorably with the average cost for certificates of deposit which averaged 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is charged to operations to bring the total allowance for loan losses to an amount that represents management s best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio  based on historical experience  volume and type of lending conducted by the company  industry standards  the level and status of past due and non performing loans  the general economic conditions in its lending area and other factors affecting the collectibility of the loans in its portfolio 
the provision for loan losses was  for the year ended september  compared to  for the year ended september  the allowance for loan losses increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   due primarily to the increase in net loans outstanding 
the current allowance represents 
of loans outstanding at september  the company had net charge offs of  for the year ended september  compared to net charge offs of  for the year ended september  see also  business of floridafirst bank allowance for loan losses and real estate owned 
other income 
substantially the entire decrease in other income for the year ending september  compared to september  is attributable to the million gain from the branch sale in january other expenses 
other expense decreased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   due primarily to million of costs related to the company s decision to terminate the defined benefit pension plan and the adoption of a directors retirement plan 
in addition  compensation and employee benefits increased slightly due to the hiring of additional sales personnel and an average increase in salary adjustments 
these costs were offset by certain vacancies in staff positions during the year and savings related to compensation and employee benefits for personnel at the branches involved in the branch sale in january occupancy and equipment costs increased due to costs associated with the installation and operation of automated teller machines at all branch locations in impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this prospectus have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or  to the same extent  as prices of goods and services
