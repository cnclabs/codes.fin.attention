item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general at june  the company had total assets of billion  total deposits of million and stockholders equity of million compared to total assets of billion  total deposits of million and stockholders equity of million at june  these changes represent a increase in total assets and a increase in stockholders equity during fiscal the southern california economy and real estate markets in the company s lending area have remained strong during the year 
the company s level of nonperforming assets declined from june   both in total dollar amount and as a percentage of total assets 
the company currently includes nonaccrual loans or more days past due less any specific allowances on these loans  troubled debt restructured loans and reo in determining its level of nonperforming assets 
at june   the company reported million in nonperforming assets compared to million and million at june  and  respectively 
the company recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended june  compared to million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively

results of operations general 
the company reported net earnings of million  per share diluted  for the year ended june   compared to net earnings of million  per share diluted  and million  per share diluted  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this increase in earnings for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income partially offset by an increase in other expenses 
net earnings for fiscal also includes  of recaptured accrued taxes as a result of a favorable tax audit ruling 
without this tax recapture  net earnings for the fiscal year ended june  would have been million  per share diluted  representing a increase in earnings per share over the previous year 
the increase in earnings in fiscal over was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income and an increase in noninterest income due primarily to the one time gain on sale of securities  partially offset by an increase in total other expense

net interest income before provision for loan losses 
net interest income before provision for loan losses was million  million  and million for the years ended june    and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily a result of the increase in interest earning assets relative to interest bearing liabilities during the year partially offset by the decrease in the yield on interest earning assets and an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in compared to was primarily a result of the increase in interest earning assets relative to interest bearing liabilities  as well as a decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
provision for loan losses 
during fiscal   and the company established million  million and million  respectively  of provisions for losses on loans 
the slight decrease in the provision for is primarily a result of the continued decrease in nonperforming assets during the year 
the slight increase in the provision for fiscal compared to was primarily a result of the overall growth in the loan portfolio as compared to the prior year  specifically in commercial real estate 
in addition  certain one to four family loans purchased during fiscal were considered by the company to have higher risk characteristics because they are loans outside of california  which has historically been considered the company s primary market area for one to four family loans 
management considers the level of nonperforming assets  the regional economic conditions and relevant real estate values and other factors when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the southern california economy and real estate markets in the company s primary lending area continued to be strong during fiscal  and management considers the level of allowance for loan losses at june  to be adequate 
however  even though the local economy and real estate markets were strong during fiscal  there can be no assurance that nonperforming assets will not increase and that the company will not have to establish additional loss provisions based upon future events 
other income 
other income increased slightly in to million compared to million in deposit fees increased to million for compared to million for  a increase as a result of a continued program  that began in the second quarter of fiscal  with efforts to attract checking accounts as well as a larger deposit base 
in addition  other income for fiscal reflected gains on sale of securities of  compared to none in fiscal other income increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was due to the  gain on sale of securities as well as transactional fee income for deposits and loans increasing due to a larger deposit and loan base and prepayment fees on loans increased due to a higher level of loans paying off in order to refinance in the lower rate environment during that time period 
other expense 
other expense increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase in other expense is primarily due to an increase in compensation and employee benefits and occupancy expense 
these increases during fiscal are primarily a result of three retail banking branches opened during the year and the purchase of a branch facility and its deposits from another financial institution 
included in compensation and employee benefits are expenses related to the employee stock ownership plan esop 
companies that established an esop after are required to account for the expense of the esop at the fair value of the related shares released 
the expense related to the esop was million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
other expense increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the opening of additional retail banking branches during february  the relocation of an existing branch to a larger more accessible location in august and additional staffing in the income property lending department of the company 
the following is a summary of other general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended june  in thousands professional fees bank service charges miscellaneous loan expenses other    income taxes 
income taxes increased by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal income taxes increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the effective tax rate was  and for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for as compared to is primarily a result of a  recapture of accrued taxes due to a favorable tax audit ruling 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for as compared to is primarily a result of esop expense as a percentage of net earnings before income taxes being lower in fiscal due to the increase in net earnings before income taxes 
extraordinary item and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company prepaid approximately million of its higher cost borrowings and replaced the funds with less expensive borrowings and retail deposits 
in association with the debt prepayment  the company paid a prepayment fee of  after tax 
the prepayment fee is disclosed as an extraordinary item on the statement of earnings 
the company implemented sfas no 
effective july  upon implementation  approximately million in mbs were reclassified from held to maturity to available for sale 
the company has accounted for the gains or losses on the sale of any such reclassified mbs sold within days of the reclassification date as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
any gains or losses recorded on such reclassified securities sold days or more after the reclassification date have been recorded as gain or losses on sale of securities available for sale 
in the first quarter of  the company sold million of these reclassified mbs for a gain after tax of  financial condition the company s consolidated assets totaled billion at june   compared to billion at june  stockholders equity totaled million at june  compared to million at june  the increase in assets is primarily attributable to the implementation of the company s growth strategies and was primarily funded by deposit growth and fhlb advances 
loans and mbs including assets held or available for sale increased to billion at june   from million at june  loans originated and purchased for investment were million for the year ended june   compared to million for the same period the previous year 
mbs purchased for investment decreased to million at june   from million for the same period the previous year 
at june   the company s multifamily loan portfolio totaled million  or of total loans  an increase of as compared to million at june   and its commercial loan portfolio totaled million  or of total loans  an increase of as compared to million at june  of the company s  of charge offs in fiscal   or were for one to four family loans and none were multifamily or for commercial real estate loans 
the company s commercial loan portfolio increased significantly during the past fiscal year  increasing by approximately 
both because the size of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased significantly and most of the loans comprising the portfolio are unseasoned  having been originated within the last three fiscal years  the company s past loss experience with respect to its commercial loan portfolio may not be representative of the risk of loss in such portfolio in the future 
see business allowances for loan and real estate losses 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk and to be more vulnerable to deteriorating economic conditions than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
these loans typically involve higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of such loans generally depend on the income produced by the operation or sale of the property being sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 
even though the southern california real estate market was healthy in fiscal  recessionary economic conditions of the type that have prevailed in recent years in the company s lending market area tend to result in higher vacancy and reduced rental rates and net operating incomes from multifamily and commercial real estate properties 
see business lending activities multifamily lending and commercial real estate lending 
loan sales decreased to million for the year ended june   compared to million for the same period ended june  the decrease in loan sales is primarily a result of a decrease in funding of fixed rate loans during a period of higher interest rates during fiscal compared to these fixed rate loans were generally held for sale during this period 
loans serviced for others increased to million at june  from million at june  primarily due to a lower rate of loan prepayments in fiscal compared to fiscal capital resources and liquidity regulatory capital requirements firrea and implementing ots capital regulations require the bank to maintain certain minimum tangible  core and risk based regulatory capital levels 
the minimum core capital requirement is for all but the highest rated savings associations

june  tangible risk based capital core capital capital amount amount amount dollars in thousands regulatory capital    required minimum    excess capital    in addition  fdicia required the ots to implement a system of regulatory sanctions against institutions that are not adequately capitalized  with the sanctions growing more severe the lower the institution s capital 
under fdicia  the ots issued regulations establishing five separate capital categories well capitalized 
adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized  differentiated by core capital ratio  level of core capital to risk weighted assets and risk based capital ratio 
see business regulation and supervision prompt corrective action requirements 
an institution is treated as well capitalized if its core capital ratio to adjusted total assets is at least  its ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets is at least and its total capital to risk weighted assets ratio is at least 
the following table summarizes the capital ratios of the well capitalized category and the bank s regulatory capital at june  as compared to such ratios

sources of funds and liquidity sources of capital and liquidity for the company on a stand alone basis include distributions from the bank 
dividends and other capital distributions from the bank are subject to regulatory restrictions 
see business regulation and supervision savings and loan holding company regulation payment of dividends and other capital distributions by bank and market for the registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
the bank s primary sources of funds in fiscal were deposits  fhlb advances  principal and interest payments on loans and proceeds from the sale of loans 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the bank also has other potential sources of liquidity  such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and liquidating existing short term assets 
the bank has continued to maintain the required minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by ots regulations 
this requirement  which may be varied at the direction of the ots depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the required ratio is currently 
the bank s average liquidity ratios were   and  at june    and  respectively 
management currently attempts to maintain a liquidity ratio as close to the minimum as possible 
liquidity levels reflect management s strategy to invest excess liquidity in higher yielding interest earning assets such as loans or mbs 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows used by investing activities and financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities consisted primarily of cash flows from the sale of loans held for sale which totaled million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the company originated loans for sale of million  million  and million during fiscal years   and  respectively 
net cash used by investing activities consisted primarily of loan originations  loan purchases and investment purchases  offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from principal reductions on mbs and maturities of other investment securities 
loans originated and purchased for investment were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
proceeds from principal repayments on loans were million  million and million for fiscal years ended   and proceeds from maturities and principal payments of investment securities were million  million  and million for fiscal years ended   and  respectively 
net cash used by financing activities consisting primarily of net activity in deposit accounts and proceeds from funding and repayments of fhlb advances 
the net change in deposits was an increase of million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
during the second quarter of fiscal the bank purchased a retail branch office and its million of deposits from another financial institution 
this branch is located in rowland heights  california 
the bank also opened three in store branches in wal mart stores  the nation s largest retailer  during the second half of fiscal a fourth wal mart in store branch was opened in august with plans to open  at least  two additional wal mart in store branches later in fiscal all of the bank s existing and planned wal mart in store branches are located in the southern california area 
in addition  while the vast majority of the bank s deposits are retail in nature  the bank accepted million in time deposits from a political subdivision during fiscal the bank considers these funds to be wholesale deposits and an alternative borrowing source rather than a customer relationship and their levels are determined by management s decision as to the most economic funding sources 
the net proceeds from fhlb advances were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
due to the company s growth strategies and increased competition for retail deposits in fiscal   and  the company s use of fhlb advances increased 
at june   the company had million of total liabilities in advances outstanding from the fhlb compared to million of total liabilities at june  the maximum amount of advances that the company had outstanding at any month end was million 
management anticipates increased borrowing from the fhlb again in fiscal see business sources and funds borrowings 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at june   cash and short term investments totaled million  a decrease of from million at june  at june   the company had outstanding commitments to originate loans of million and no commitments to purchase loans 
at june   the company had million of approved undisbursed lines of credit 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination and purchase commitments 
certificates of deposits which have contractual maturities in one year or less from june   totaled million 
if a significant portion of the maturing certificates are not renewed at maturity  the company s other sources of liquidity include fhlb advances  principal and interest payments on loans  proceeds from loan sales and other borrowings  such as repurchase transactions 
the company could also choose to pay higher rates to maintain maturing deposits  which could result in increased cost of funds 
historically  the company has maintained a significant portion of maturing deposits 
while management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the current competitive rate environment  these are not expected to have a material impact on the long term liquidity position of the company 
asset liability management the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of falling interest rates therefore  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap theoretically may be adversely affected due to its interest earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  during a period of rising interest rates  theoretically  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap position may increase as it is able to invest in higher yielding interest earning assets at a more rapid rate than its interest bearing liabilities reprice 
in addition  a positive gap may not protect an institution with a large portfolio of arm loans from increases in interest rates for extended time periods as such instruments generally have periodic and lifetime interest rate caps 
additionally  the company s arm loans are predominantly tied to cofi  a lagging market index  and rapid increases in interest rates could have a negative impact on the company s earnings 
accordingly  interest rates and the resulting cost of funds increases in a rapidly increasing rate environment could exceed the cap levels on these instruments and negatively impact net interest income 
declining interest rates have  in general  benefited the company primarily due to the effect of the lagging market index which has resulted in interest income declining at a slower rate than interest expense 
at june   the company s total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year exceeded its total interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in the same time by million  representing a one year cumulative positive gap ratio of 
this compares to million at june   which represented a positive gap ratio of 
this increase in the one year cumulative gap ratio is primarily a result of the following 
a significant amount of financing activity during the fiscal year in adjustable rate loans 

the extension of the assumed repricing period of the company s money market deposit accounts 
this is consistent with the company s actual experience with these accounts over the past fiscal year 
the company manages the resulting interest rate risk by extending the maturities of various liabilities such as fhlb advances and retail certificates of deposit 
the company closely monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
the bank s board of directors has established an asset liability committee  responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which generally meets weekly and reports to the board of directors on interest rate risk and trends on a quarterly basis 
the company s cumulative gap position is at a level satisfactory to management 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain its positive gap position or that its strategies will not result in a negative gap position in the future 
the level of the movement of interest rates  up or down  is an uncertainty and could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
the company does not currently engage in the use of trading activities  high risk derivatives and synthetic instruments or hedging activities in controlling its interest rate risk 
such uses are permitted at the recommendation of the asset liability committee with the approval of the board of directors  however  the company does not anticipate engaging in such practices in the immediate future 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at june   which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
specifically  the company assumed a prepayment rate ranging from to on arm loans  and to on fixed rate loans 
additionally  the company utilized deposit decay rate assumptions of for passbook accounts  for checking accounts and to for money market deposit accounts in the one year or less category 
the range of decay rates for money market deposit accounts is due to the market rate sensitivity of various money market checking accounts 
these decay rates are based upon the company s historical experience  but there is no assurance that the assumed rates will correspond to future rates

the call dates were used for purposes of the gap analysis 
interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between net interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their arm loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
average balance sheet the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company for the years ended june    and the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown except where noted otherwise 
average balances are derived from average month end balances 
management does not believe that the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily balances has caused any material differences in the information presented

as of the date of this report  the company has experienced no material disruption in the operation of its business as a result of the transition from to however  it is possible that the full impact of year issues has not been fully recognized  and no assurances can be given that year problems will not emerge 
the total cost of the company s year program was approximately million  including approximately  incurred in the year ended june  program costs consisted primarily of costs for acquiring equipment and software  which are being depreciated over their useful lives  and personnel and consulting costs  which were expensed as incurred 
the company has funded these year expenditures primarily through operating cash flow 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
the company does not currently engage in trading activities 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using several tools 
one measure of the company s exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the company s maturity and rate sensitivity analysis under the caption md a asset liability management 
another measure  required to be performed by ots regulated institutions  is the test specified by ots thrift bulletin no 
a  interest rate risk management 
this test measures the impact on net interest income and on net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
following are the estimated impacts of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at june   calculated in compliance with thrift bulletin no 
a percentage change in change in interest rates in basis points net interest income net portfolio value the percentage change in this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change in this column represents net portfolio value of the bank in a stable interest rate environment versus the net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while structuring the company s asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
the company continually evaluates interest rate risk management opportunities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
management has focused its efforts on increasing the company s yield cost spread through wholesale and retail growth opportunities 
the following table shows the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the total balance of expected maturities and principal repayments and the instruments fair values at june  market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments

total balance equals the notional amount of off balance sheet items and interest rates are the weighted average interest rates of the underlying loans 
expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments of principal 
the company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments and prepayments of principal 
the prepayment experience reflected herein is based on the company s historical experience 
the company s average constant prepayment rate cpr on its total fixed rate portfolio ranges from to and on its adjustable rate portfolio from to for interest earning assets excluding investment securities  which do not have prepayment features 
for deposit liabilities  in accordance with standard industry practice and the company s own historical experience  decay factors  were used to estimate deposit runoff of   and between to for passbook  checking and money market deposit accounts  respectively 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from the company s historical experience
