item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation when you read this section of this report  it is important that you also read the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those we anticipate in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and in risk factors 
overview we are a development stage pharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of our drug  levulan r  combined with exposure to light  to treat and detect various medical conditions 
our first product  levulan r topical solution with photodynamic therapy for actinic keratoses  or aks  of the face and scalp  was approved by the fda on december  the pma  the regulatory application for the clinical trial version of our blu u tm  was approved on the same day 
the development of our other dermatology and non dermatology potential indications are at exploratory  phase i or phase ii stages 
see business our products 
since our inception in  we have primarily devoted our resources to funding research and development and as a result  we have experienced significant operating losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  our transition from a development stage company to a profitable operating company is dependent upon approval by the fda of a pma supplement which we will file shortly covering the commercial version of the blu u tm 
our wilmington facilities  and perhaps our blu u tm manufacturer  must pass inspection by the fda before the supplement is approved 
also  we must develop a market for our products 
to address this need  in november  we entered into a co development  marketing and supply agreement with schering ag 
schering ag s us affiliate  berlex laboratories  inc  is responsible for the marketing and selling of levulan r pdt for ak and other dermatology products in the united states which we and schering ag may co develop 
we will decide shortly which clinical programs will be funded this year 
schering ag is obligated to spend two thirds of the development budget  up to million  while we are obligated to spend one third of the co development budget up to million during while schering ag will market and sell the levulan r kerastick tm  and market the blu u tm  we are responsible for distributing  maintaining and repairing the blu u tm 
at this time  we intend to lease the blu u tm to doctors 
we expect to build sufficient inventory of the blu u tm which we will finance initially through schering ag and later through equipment financing or our own cash flow 
we have agreed to maintain a year s worth of inventory of ala  in bulk  or as finished kerastick tm brand applicators until we obtain a second source of supply 
also  we have purchased key pieces of equipment to prepare for the establishment of a limited production line so that a second source could manufacture the kerastick tm 
in  we licensed the primary patents for our drug technology platform from parteq research and development innovation  the licensing arm of queen s university  kingston  ontario  canada 
our exclusive license covers all countries of the world  except canada 
parteq is entitled to minimum royalties of up to cdn million of which cdn  has been paid and recorded as deferred royalties in  based upon the milestone payments we received from schering ag 
we have expensed the payment of the cdn  and are also entitled to credit this payment against the cdn million 
we must also pay parteq royalties on net sales of products  including products marketed and sold by schering ag 
to strengthen our cash position and in order to support ongoing operations during the fda review process  we completed a private placement of  million shares of our common stock in january raising gross proceeds of million 
in addition  on february   we signed a definitive agreement with ten mutual funds or collective trust funds advised by invesco funds group  inc for a private placement of  shares of our common stock 
the purchase price is per share 
the closing is scheduled to occur promptly after the declaration by the sec that a registration statement covering shares is effective 
if the shares are not registered by days following the filing of the registration statement  the funds have the right to terminate the agreement 
we agreed to pay at closing a commission of on the gross proceeds plus a non accountable expense allowance of  to the placement agent 
see management s discussion and analysis financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we have not yet derived any commercial revenues from product sales 
however  assuming that the pma supplement is approved by the fda and that our facilities pass fda inspection  we expect to receive royalties and supply fees from schering ag later this year from sales of our first product 
even with these revenues  we expect to continue to incur operating losses during the next one to two years depending upon sales levels  as we continue to incur research and development costs for our dermatology and non dermatology development programs 
we also expect to incur capital expenditures in the coming months at the facilities of our kerastick tm brand manufacturer 
at the current time  we are preparing for the commercial launch of our first products 
however  delays in the fda approval process of our pma supplement  or in delivery to schering ag of sufficient product supplies from our third party manufacturers for the launch of the levulan r kerastick tm  or schering ag s ability to hire and train sufficient sales representatives  would delay the marketing of our products and would have a significant adverse impact on our near term financial results 
if product sales by schering ag do not meet our expectations  then in order to advance our research and development program as now planned beyond  we may need to raise additional funds 
for non dermatology indications  we may enter into joint development or licensing arrangements  both domestically and internationally  with pharmaceutical companies  in which we would seek to have an alliance partner make up front and or milestone payments  and assume some or all of the costs of clinical testing and of obtaining regulatory marketing approval for the products licensed 
to the extent that we do not enter into such arrangements  we may require separate funding to complete the regulatory approval process for non dermatology products and would likely need additional funds to market these potential products 
see risk factors we must receive separate approval for each of our potential products before we can sell them commercially in the united states or abroad  and if we are unable to obtain the necessary capital to fund our operations  we will have to delay our development programs and may not be able to complete our clinical trials 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and interest income 
interest income  the only significant source of income at the current time  was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest is earned primarily on united states government securities 
in  interest was higher than in as we earned interest on the proceeds from our january private placement and on the payments from schering ag 
interest income decreased for the year ended as compared to for the year ended  as we continued to spend funds for ongoing research and development 
interest income is expected to increase due to the receipt from schering ag of million in cash proceeds and million for  shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter of  and after the million payment due dusa within days of first commercial sale in the united states  subject to approval of the commercial version of the blu u tm 
if the recent private placement for million closes  we expect that additional interest income will accrue 
however  unless our pma supplement is approved and a large market for our first products develop  interest income will decline as funds are spent for our research and development programs 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
research and development expenses 
research and development costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the decrease in costs following reflected our efforts to delay some of our research programs while we were waiting for fda approval and completion of a dermatology partnership 
the higher costs in also reflect the completion of our multi center phase iii trials for aks  preparation for the filing of the aks nda  and preparation for initiation of the bladder cancer pd phase i ii trial  all of which occurred in we expect that research and development costs will increase above expenditures  although a portion of these costs will be reimbursed by schering ag 
costs and development fees associated with agreements for research projects and clinical studies commit us to make payments during of approximately  see note h 
to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
general and administration expenses 
general and administration expenses for the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
these costs are expected to increase significantly in the future as we continue to add personnel  including additional executive officers 
income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  for federal income tax purposes and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  for federal reporting purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
a provision for alternative minimum tax has been made in the amount of  we have implemented sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this statement establishes standards for the way that a public business enterprise reports information about operating segments in annual financial statements and interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
we have determined that  at present  we operate in one segment which is the development of emerging technologies using drugs in combination with light to treat and detect disease 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the statement is effective for the fiscal quarters of our fiscal year ending december  we are in the process of evaluating the effect of this statement on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily from sales of securities in public and private offerings and recently with milestone payments from schering ag 
in january  we issued  million shares of our common stock in a private placement pursuant to regulation d of the securities act of receiving gross proceeds of million 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
since the closing of the agreement with schering ag  schering ag has paid million in cash milestones and million for shares of our common stock 
the revenue from the milestone payments has been deferred and amortization will begin following the first commercial sale of our products 
see note f 
to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
if the invesco private placement of  million shares of common stock closes  gross proceeds of million would place us in a strong financial position 
as of december   our total assets  consisting primarily of cash and united states government securities available for sale  were  as compared to  as of december  our united states government securities available for sale have an aggregate cost of  and a current aggregate market value of  as of december   resulting in a net unrealized loss on securities available for sale of  provision for which has been recorded as part of shareholders equity and as an item of comprehensive income 
as of december   the aggregate cost was  and the market value was  resulting in an unrealized gain of  the market value of our government securities fluctuates with changes in interest rates in the united states from the time these securities were acquired 
losses can be realized  depending upon the timing of our need to convert government securities into cash to meet our working capital requirements 
our government securities currently have yields ranging from to  and maturity dates ranging from january  to november  as of december   these securities had yields ranging from to and maturity dates ranging from january  to august  we have invested our funds in liquid investments  so that we will have ready access to our cash reserves as needed for the funding of our development plan on a short term and long term basis 
the net proceeds from our january private placement and the funds from schering ag have also been invested in short and medium term us government securities 
as of december   we had current liabilities of  as compared to  as of december  since our inception  we have had no long term debt  nor do we have any plans to enter into any such financial arrangements 
we do have a secured line of credit from schering ag for up to million to help us finance inventory purchases of our blu u tm from our supplier 
this line of credit is interest free but must be re paid within one year of our first draw down of funds 
our management is currently focusing its attention on the commercialization of levulan r pdt for aks  the dermatology co development program and development of our bladder cancer detection indication 
as part of this effort  we have committed to reimburse the manufacturer of our kerastick tm applicator in the amount of  for construction at its facilities related to our product 
full development and testing of all potential indications which are currently under development or being consider for development  may require additional funding 
the timing of expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including progress of our research and development programs  the results of preclinical and clinical trials  the timing of regulatory marketing approvals  competitive developments  payments under the agreement with schering ag and any additional collaborative arrangements  if any  we may enter  and the availability of other financing 
there can be no assurance  however  that sufficient funds will be available to enable us to obtain regulatory marketing approval or to market any future product for any indications currently under development 
there is no way to predict the timing or magnitude of revenues from the marketing of our products or whether any such revenues will be realized 
while the net proceeds of the january offering and the schering ag payments will enable us to maintain our current research program as planned and support the commercialization of levulan r pdt for aks through at least the next months  in order to maintain and expand continuing research and development programs  dusa will need to close the invesco private placement or raise additional funds through future corporate alliances  financings  or other sources  depending upon the amount of revenues we receive from our first product 
if sufficient funds are available  we may also use our resources to acquire by license  purchase or other arrangements  businesses  technologies  or products that complement  enhance or expand our business 
we will be actively seeking relationships with pharmaceutical or other suitable organizations to market some of our potential non dermatology products and technologies  or to provide funding for research projects 
we have full time employees 
we have employment agreements with our four key executive officers 
we have purchased and are the named beneficiary of a key man life insurance  having a face value of cdn million on the life of our president 
we also have retained numerous independent consultants  and the services of key researchers at leading university centers  whose activities are coordinated by our employees 
see note h 
to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect that we will hire or retain significantly more employees and consultants as commercialization of levulan r pdt approaches  particularly in the operations  financial and regulatory areas 
we have not made any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the near term 
if we decide  in the future  to establish a limited production line for the manufacture of the kerastick tm  we expect that our facility will be governed by environmental laws  but we do not expect these laws to require material capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future  or any assurance that our operations  business or assets will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations 
see business government regulation 
inflation although inflation rates have been comparatively low in recent years  inflation is expected to apply upward pressure on our operating costs 
we have included an inflation factor in our cost estimates 
however  the overall net effect of inflation on our operations is expected to be minimal 
market risk we hold fixed income us government securities which are subject to interest rate market risks 
however  we do not believe that the risk is material as we make our investments in relatively short term instruments and we strive to match the maturity dates of these instruments to our cash flow needs 
a ten percent decline in the average yield of these instruments would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
year compliance 
many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
in order to distinguish st century dates from th century dates  the date code field needed to be expanded to digits 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems were upgraded or replaced in order to comply with these year requirements 
the use of software and computer systems that are not year compliant could have resulted in system failures or miscalculations resulting in disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal business activities 
to date  we have not suffered any disruptions in our computer systems or software when the expanded date code field was first used on january  in addition  to date  we have not been made aware that any third party systems we rely on  the manufacturing systems of our vendors or the systems our customers use to order our services have suffered disruptions in their systems
