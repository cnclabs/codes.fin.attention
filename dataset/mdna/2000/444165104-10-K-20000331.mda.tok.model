the principal earning assets are the loan portfolio  comprised of commercial loans to businesses  mortgage loans to businesses and individuals  consumer loans such as car loans  home equity loans  etc 
and credit card loans  along with the investment portfolio 
the portfolio is invested primarily in us government agency securities  us government agency mortgage backed securities and mortgage related securities

deposits and borrowings not required to fund loans and other assets are invested primarily in us government and us government agency securities 
net interest income is affected by a number of factors including the level  pricing  and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  interest rate fluctuations  asset quality and the amount of noninterest bearing deposits and capital 
in the following discussion  interest income is presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis fte 
fully taxable equivalent interest income restates reported interest income on tax exempt loans and securities as if such interest were taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 
net interest income on an fte basis in was million compared to million in and million in the increase in net interest income in compared to was due to a million increase in interest earning assets  partially offset by a decline in the net interest margin of six basis points 
the increase in interest earning assets was mainly due to a higher average volume of investment securities and loans 
the improvement in net interest income in compared to was due to a million increase in interest earning assets  partially offset by a basis point decline in the net interest margin 
higher average volumes of investment securities and loans were the primary factors underlying the increase in interest earning assets for the period compared to net interest margin net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income on a fte basis by average interest earning assets 
the company s net interest margin was   and for  and  respectively 
the six basis point decline in net interest margin from to was due primarily to the impact of treasury share repurchases and lower rates earned on loans and investment securities 
partially offsetting these factors was an increase in average demand deposits and lower rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
the basis point decline in net interest margin in compared to was due to the same factors described above in the and comparison  including higher average demand deposits 
the company s average cost of deposits for was compared to for and for approximately of the company s deposits were in transaction accounts  in savings accounts  and in time deposits as of december  provision and allowance for possible loan losses the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses the allowance and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of management 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a monthly basis 
methodology employed for assessing the adequacy of the allowance consists of the following criteria the establishment of reserve amounts for all specifically identified criticized loans  including those arising from business combinations  that have been designated as requiring attention by management s internal loan review program 
the establishment of reserves for pools of homogenous types of loans not subject to specific review  including family residential mortgages  consumer loans  and credit card accounts  based upon historical loss rates 
an allocation for the non criticized loans in each portfolio  and for all off balance sheet exposures  based upon the historical average loss experience of those portfolios 
consideration is also given to the changed risk profile brought about by the aforementioned business combinations  customer knowledge  the results of ongoing credit quality monitoring processes  the adequacy and expertise of the company s lending staff  underwriting policies  loss histories  delinquency trends  the cyclical nature of economic and business conditions and the concentration of real estate related loans located in the northeastern part of the united states 
since many of the loans depend upon the sufficiency of collateral as a secondary source of repayment  any adverse trend in the real estate markets could affect underlying values available to protect the company from loss 
other evidence used to determine the amount of the allowance and its components are as follows regulatory and other examinations the amount and trend of criticized loans actual losses peer comparisons with other financial institutions economic data associated with the real estate market in the company s area of operations opportunities to dispose of marginally performing loans for cash considerations based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all attendant factors associated with the loan portfolio  management considers the allowance for possible loan losses to be adequate at december  the provision for possible loan losses was million for compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in from was due to a million special provision taken to conform the loan reserve policies of jeff and sjb to that of the company 
the increased provision in when compared to was primarily due to higher provisions taken by acquired companies 
the allowance as a percentage of total loans outstanding at year end for the last three years was  and

at the end of the reporting period  there were no known uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s liquidity or capital resources 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management the primary objectives of asset liability management are to provide for the safety of depositor and investor funds  assure adequate liquidity  maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive earning assets and interest sensitive liabilities and enhance earnings 
liquidity management is a planning process that ensures that the company has ample funds to satisfy operational needs  projected deposit outflows  repayment of borrowing and loan obligations and the projected credit needs of its customer base 
interest rate sensitivity management ensures that the company maintains acceptable levels of net interest income throughout a range of interest rate environments 
the company seeks to maintain its interest rate risk within a range that it believes is both manageable and prudent  given its capital and income generating capacity 
liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital that would arise from a bank s inability to meet its obligations when they come due  without incurring unacceptable losses 
the company uses several measurements in monitoring its liquidity position 
in addition  the company has a number of borrowing facilities with banks  primary broker dealers  the federal home loan bank and federal reserve that are or can be used as sources of liquidity without having to sell assets to raise cash 
at december   the company s liquidity ratios exceed all minimum standards set forth by internal policies 
the company has an asset liability management committee which manages the risks associated with the volatility of interest rates and the resulting impact on net interest income  net income and capital 
the management of interest rate risk at the company is performed by i analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap and ii income simulation analysis which analyzes the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income  net income and capital over specific periods of time and captures the dynamic impact of interest rate changes on the company s mix of assets and liabilities 
the table on the following page presents the gap position of the company at december  in preparing this table  management has anticipated prepayments for mortgage backed securities and mortgage related securities according to standard industry prepayment assumptions in effect at year end 
total loans includes adjustable rate loans which are placed according to repricing periods 
fixed rate residential mortgages are assumed to prepay at an annual rate of which is consistent with historical average housing turnover rates 
money market deposits and interest bearing demand accounts have been included in the due within days category 
assets with daily floating rates are included in the due within days category 
assets and liabilities are included in the table based on their maturities  expected cash repayments or period of first repricing  subject to the foregoing assumptions 
in analyzing its gap position  although all time periods are considered  the company emphasizes the next twelve month period 
an institution is considered to be liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also repricing within that time period 
conversely  an institution is considered to be asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing is less than the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing during the same period 
theoretically  in a falling interest rate environment  a negative gap should result in an increase in net interest income  and in a rising interest rate environment this negative gap should adversely affect net interest income 
the converse would be true for a positive gap 
however  shortcomings are inherent in a simplified gap analysis that may result in changes in interest rates affecting net interest income more or less than the gap analysis would indicate 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
furthermore  repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating gap 
also  gap does not permit analysis of how changes in the mix of various assets and liabilities and growth rate assumptions impact net interest income

net interest income simulation considers the relative sensitivities of the balance sheet including the effects of interest rate caps on adjustable rate mortgages and the relatively stable aspects of core deposits 
as such  net interest income simulation is designed to address the likely probability of interest rate changes and behavioral response of the balance sheet to those changes 
market value of portfolio equity represents the fair values of the net present value of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items 
financial modeling is performed under several scenarios including a regulatory rate shock scenario which measures changes in net interest income over the next twelve months and market value of portfolio equity given instantaneous and sustained changes in interest rates
