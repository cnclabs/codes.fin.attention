the company commenced operations in by purchasing from the rtc certain assets and assuming certain liabilities of the bank s predecessor  pan american federal savings bank 
the company has used the bank as a base for expansion into its current specialty finance businesses

this business originated and sold or securitized subprime mortgage loans secured primarily by first mortgages on single family residences 
in connection with the discontinuance of the mortgage finance division  all related operating activity for all periods presented is treated as discontinued operations for financial statement reporting purposes 
for the purpose of determining net interest income related to discontinued operations  the company included all interest income from its mortgage finance business less an allocation for interest expense 
the company allocated deposits and warehouse lines of credit to the discontinued mortgage operations in computing interest expense 
all non interest income and non interest expense of the mortgage operations was also charged to discontinued operations 
see item business discontinued operations mortgage finance 
finance companies  such as the company  generate income from a combination of spread or net interest income ie  the difference between the yield on loans  net of loan losses  and the cost of funding and non interest income ie  the fees received for various services and gains on the sales of loans 
income is used to cover operating expenses incurred ie  compensation and benefits  occupancy and other expenses in generating that income 
each of the company s businesses  as described below  generates income from a combination of spread and non interest income 
automobile finance in  the bank commenced its automobile finance business through its subsidiary  united auto credit corporation such business  uacc 
uacc acquires  holds for investment and services subprime retail automobile installment sales contracts auto contracts generated by franchised and independent dealers of used automobiles 
uacc s customers are considered subprime because they typically have limited credit histories or credit histories that preclude them from obtaining loans through traditional sources 
as uacc provides all marketing  origination  underwriting and servicing activities for its loans  income is generated from a combination of spread and non interest income and is used to cover all operating costs  including compensation  occupancy and systems expense

the company does not sell or have the risk of underwriting the underlying insurance policy 
as a result of bpn performing substantially all marketing and servicing activities  the company s role is primarily that of an underwriter and funder of loans 
therefore  ipf s income is generated primarily on a spread basis  supplemented by non interest income generated from late payment and returned check fees 
the bank uses this income to cover the costs of underwriting and loan administration  including compensation  occupancy and data processing expenses

management of interest rate risk the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management program is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in the company s business activities  determine the level of appropriate risk given the company s operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and manage the risk consistent with guidelines approved by the board of directors 
through such management  the company seeks to reduce the exposure of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis the asset liability position of the company  including simulation of the effect on capital of various interest rate scenarios 
the company s profits depend  in part  on the difference  or spread  between the effective rate of interest received on the loans it originates and the interest rates paid on deposits and other financing facilities which can be adversely affected by movements in interest rates 
in addition  between the time the company originates loans and investors sales commitments are received  the company may be exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that interest rates move upward or downward during the time the loans are held for sale 
the company mitigates these risks somewhat by purchasing or originating adjustable rate mortgages that reprice frequently in an increasing or declining interest rate environment 
also  the company attempts to sell substantially all of its loans held for sale on a regular basis  thereby reducing significantly the amount of time these loans are held by the company 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by the board of directors and management through the use of a model which estimates the change in the bank s net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and npv ratio is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the company reviews a market value model the ots npv model prepared quarterly by the ots  based on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports filed with the ots 
the ots npv model measures the bank s interest rate risk by approximating the bank s npv under various scenarios which range from a basis point increase to a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
the ots has incorporated an interest rate risk component into its regulatory capital rule for thrifts 
under the rule  an institution whose sensitivity measure  as defined by the ots  in the event of a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates exceeds would be required to deduct an interest rate risk component in calculating its total capital for purposes of the risk based capital requirement 
at september   the most recent date for which the relevant ots npv model is available  the bank s sensitivity measure resulting from a basis point decrease in interest rates was basis points and would result in a million increase in the npv of the bank and a basis point increase in interest rates was basis points and would result in a million decrease in the npv of the bank 
at september   the bank s sensitivity measure was below the threshold at which the bank could be required to hold additional risk based capital under ots regulations 
although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
management monitors the results of this modeling  which are presented to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the following tables show the npv and projected change in the npv of the bank at september  and december  assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of  and basis points bp 
these tables are based on data prepared by the ots 
the company makes no representation as to the accuracy of this data

while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the company has continued to maintain the required minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by ots regulations 
this requirement  which may be varied at the direction of the ots depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the required ratio is currently  and the company has always met or exceeded this requirement 
management  through its asset and liability committee  which meets monthly or more frequently if necessary  monitors rates and terms of competing sources of funds to use the most cost effective source of funds wherever possible

the company s asset review committee reviews for classification all problem and potential problem assets and reports the results of its review to the board of directors quarterly 
the company has incorporated the ots internal asset classifications as a part of its credit monitoring systems and in order of increasing weakness  these designations are substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  questionable and there is a high possibility of loss 
loss assets are considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset is not warranted 
assets which do have weaknesses but do not currently have sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the categories described above are designated as special mention 
at december   the company had million in assets classified as special mention  million of assets classified as substandard   in assets classified as doubtful and no assets classified as loss

a non mortgage loan is placed on nonaccrual status when it is delinquent for days or more 
when a loan is reclassified from accrual to nonaccrual status  all previously accrued interest is reversed 
interest income on nonaccrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received or the borrower s ability to make periodic interest and principal payments is in accordance with the loan terms  at which time the loan is returned to accrual status

these allowances include specific reserves for identifiable impairments of individual loans and general valuation allowances for estimates of probable losses not specifically identified 
in addition  the company s allowance for loan losses is also increased by its allocation of acquisition discounts related to the purchase of automobile installment contracts 
no loan loss provision is made for loans held for sale 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors  including an assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio  prior loss experience  the levels and trends of non performing loans  the concentration of credit  current and prospective economic conditions and other factors 
the company s management uses its best judgment in providing for possible loan losses and establishing allowances for loan losses 
however  the allowance is an estimate which is inherently uncertain and depends on the outcome of future events 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examinations process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to increase the allowance based upon their judgment of the information available to them at the time of their examination 
the bank s current year examination by its regulatory agencies was completed recently and no adjustments to the bank s allowance for loan losses was required

the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services
