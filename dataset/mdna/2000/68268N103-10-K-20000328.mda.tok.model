year similar to most businesses  we rely heavily on information systems technology to operate in an efficient and effective manner 
much of this technology takes the form of computers and associated hardware for data processing and analysis 
in addition  a great deal of information processing technology is embedded in microelectronic devices 
a year problem was anticipated which could result from the use in computer hardware and software of two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
as a result  computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year before january   we identified  inventoried and assessed computer software  hardware  embedded chips and third party interfaces 
where necessary  remediation and replacements were identified and implemented 
all of our mission critical and non mission critical systems have operated to date  with no interruption in business operations 
the year problem has resulted in no material costs 
we will remain vigilant for year related problems that may yet occur  due to hidden defects in our computer hardware or software or at mission critical external entities 
we anticipate that the year problem will not create material disruptions to our mission critical facilities or operations  and will not result in material costs 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

to fiscal years beginning after june  see note to the financial statements 
information regarding forward looking statements statements in this annual report that are not historical information are forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements include the discussions under business future demand and competition and elsewhere regarding northern border pipeline s efforts to pursue opportunities to further increase the capacity of its pipeline system  the discussion under business shippers regarding potential contract extensions  the discussion under business ferc regulation cost of service tariff regarding a project cost containment mechanism related to the chicago project  and the discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
although we believe that our expectations regarding future events are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business  we can give no assurance that our goals will be achieved or that our expectations regarding future developments will be realized 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include future demand for natural gas  availability of economic western canadian natural gas  industry conditions  natural gas  political and regulatory developments that impact ferc proceedings  northern border pipeline s success in sustaining its positions in such proceedings  or the success of intervenors in opposing northern border pipeline s positions  northern border pipeline s ability to replace its rate base as it is depreciated and amortized  competitive developments by canadian and us natural gas transmission companies  political and regulatory developments in the us and canada  conditions of the capital markets and equity markets  and our ability to successfully implement our plan for addressing year issues during the periods covered by the forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest rate exposure results from variable rate borrowings from commercial banks 
to mitigate potential fluctuations in interest rates  we attempt to maintain a significant portion of our consolidated debt portfolio in fixed rate debt 
we also use interest rate swap agreements to increase the portion of fixed rate debt 
as of december   approximately of our debt portfolio  after considering the effect of the interest rate swap agreements  is in fixed rate debt 
if interest rates average one percentage point more than rates in effect as of december   consolidated annual interest expense would increase by approximately million 
this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate borrowings and interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december  approximately million of this increase would result from applying the hypothetical interest rates to northern border pipeline s outstanding debt portfolio 
northern border pipeline s tariff provides the pipeline an opportunity to recover  among other items  interest expense 
therefore  the partnership believes that under northern border pipeline s current tariff  northern border pipeline would be allowed to recover the increase in its interest expense  if it were to occur 
thus  the estimated impact on our annual earnings and cash flow from a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would be a reduction of approximately million related to interest expense on borrowings other than by northern border pipeline
