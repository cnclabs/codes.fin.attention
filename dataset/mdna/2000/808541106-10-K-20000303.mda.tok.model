while the products are comparable in each segment  they vary based on the technological capabilities of each of the manufacturing operations and the respective markets and customers served 
sales by a segment into markets primarily served by a different segment occur where specific product needs cannot be cost effectively met by the manufacturing operations domiciled in that segment 
for purposes of the segment disclosure in the following tables  the term united states includes operations in the united states and canada

excluding the impact of this adjustment  the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  would have been percent 
the decrease from this adjusted effective income tax rate of percent to percent in was due to the reduction in the french statutory income tax rate from percent in to percent in and due to a greater proportion of the company s earnings being in brazil and the united states  which had lower income tax rates than france

outlook cigarette consumption and production in both the united states and brazil were lower in than in the prior year 
us cigarette consumption was impacted by adverse publicity and by increases in the retail selling price of cigarettes 
the export of cigarettes manufactured in the united states also declined in from prior year levels 
these trends are expected to continue in there appear to be signs of recovery in the russian  eastern european and asian cigarette markets as these economies are improving 
the company s brazilian business also expects to continue to increase its sales to latin american countries outside of brazil 
worldwide cigarette production is expected to increase approximately one percent in  driven by growth in emerging markets as well as growth in the ventilated and blended cigarette segments 
there continues to be excess worldwide manufacturing capacity for tobacco related papers  however  the amount of excess capacity is decreasing as paper manufacturers  including the company  are shutting down unneeded and less efficient capacity 
pricing appears to be stabilizing in most key markets and there may be opportunities for price increases as pulp prices rise 
some production downtime was experienced on certain machines during in the company s us  french and brazilian paper operations because of reduced demand 
additional paper production downtime is likely to be taken in in each of the company s three operations but to a lesser extent than in fourth quarter sales benefited in each of the company s three business units from sales to certain customers that increased their year end inventories related to concerns of possible year issues 
this may have improved the company s consolidated fourth quarter operating profit by as much as to million 
sales and operating results in the first quarter of are expected to be negatively impacted by the positive timing impact experienced in the fourth quarter of cost savings are expected to continue from recently implemented capital projects and from various cost savings programs  including the company s headcount reductions in the united states during with current market conditions  cost reduction continues to be a priority in each of the company s business units

factors that may affect future results many factors outside the control of the company could impact the company s results 
the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
year compliance historically  many computer systems and other equipment with embedded chips or processors utilized computer programs written using two digits to represent the year rather than four digits 
these programs may not properly recognize a year xx 
as a result  these programs may be unable to accurately process certain data before  during or after the year and could result in governmental and business systems failures or miscalculations causing disruptions in operations 
this problem has been commonly referred to as the year issue 
because of the numerous information systems  mill process controls and operating systems  and vendors and service providers that the company uses  as well as the company s many customers and customer locations around the world  the company could not exclude the possibility that some disruption in its business due to the year issue could occur 
therefore  the company developed and implemented plans to minimize the adverse effect of any such potential business disruptions 
prior to the end of  each of the company s business segments inventoried its business operations  assessed its susceptibility to system failures or processing errors as a result of year issues and developed plans to address those issues 
the plans focused on three elements information systems software and hardware  mill process controls and operating systems  and vendors and service providers 
each element was subdivided according to risk potential 
those issues which were considered most critical to continuing operations were given the highest priority 
plans were implemented and  where necessary  modifications or corrective actions were completed in each of the company s businesses for all high risk issues identified  as well as most of the medium risk issues identified 
in addition to the costs of new integrated computer systems which were necessary irrespective of the approach to year  the company s cost of implementing its year compliance plans totaled approximately million 
approximately two thirds of the total cost was expensed and one third included in capital projects 
the company has not experienced any business disruptions related to the year issue to date 
the company is also not aware of any such issues with respect to its information systems  mill process controls or operating systems 
furthermore  the company is not aware of any such issues at its many customers  vendors and service providers 
however  until the potential for such issues arising has been eliminated by the passage of time  it is not possible to state with certainty that the company s operations will not be disrupted by year issues 
euro currency conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legal currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro now trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and legal currencies will be withdrawn from circulation by no later than june the company established a committee to identify and implement changes necessary to address the systems and business issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include  among others  the need to adapt computer and other business systems and equipment to accommodate euro denominated transactions  competitive implications of increased price transparency within european union countries  changes in currency exchange costs and rate exposures  continuity of contracts that require payment in a legal currency and tax implications of the conversion 
the company s french subsidiaries currently utilize multi currency software that was capable of euro denominated sales and purchase transactions on january  consideration has also been given to other potential issues in connection with the conversion  including those mentioned above 
the company s french subsidiaries are in the process of implementing already purchased software capable of translating current and historical data into euro currency data  which implementation will be fully completed no later than january   at which time the euro will become the functional currency of the french subsidiaries 
the company does not anticipate any significant negative consequences of these issues and does not anticipate that the euro conversion will have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
international business risks the company and its subsidiaries are subject to international business risks  including unsettled political and economic conditions  expropriation  import and export controls and restrictions  exchange controls  inflationary economies  currency risks and risks related to the restrictions of repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
tax and repatriation matters the company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax laws in each of the countries in which it does business through wholly owned subsidiaries and through affiliates 
the company makes a comprehensive review of the income tax requirements of each of its operations  files appropriate returns and makes appropriate income tax planning analyses directed toward the minimization of its income tax obligations in these countries 
appropriate income tax provisions are determined on an individual subsidiary level and at the corporate level on both an interim and annual basis 
these processes are followed using an appropriate combination of internal staff at both the subsidiary and corporate levels as well as independent outside advisors in review of the various tax laws and in compliance reporting for the various operations 
dividend distributions are regularly made to the united states from certain foreign subsidiaries and are appropriately considered in the provision for us income taxes 
the company intends for the undistributed earnings of certain other foreign subsidiaries to be reinvested indefinitely 
these undistributed earnings are not subject to either additional foreign income taxes or us income taxes unless remitted as dividends 
accordingly  no provision has been made for us taxes on those earnings 
the company regularly reviews the status of the accumulated earnings of each of its foreign subsidiaries and reevaluates the aforementioned dividend policy as part of its overall financing plans 
hedging activities and foreign currency exchange risks management selectively hedges the company s foreign currency risks  as well as its exposure to interest rate increases on its variable rate long term debt  when it is practical and economical to do so 
the instruments used to hedge foreign currency risks are forward contracts and  to a lesser extent  option contracts 
the company utilizes various forms of interest rate hedge agreements  including interest rate swap agreements and forward rate agreements 
these instruments are purchased from well known money center banks  insurance companies or government agencies counterparties 
usually  the contracts extend for no more than months  although their contractual term has been as long as months 
management believes that credit risks with respect to the counterparties and the foreign currency risks that would not be hedged  were the counterparties to fail to fulfill their obligations under the contracts  are minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 
in addition to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates on operating profit  foreign currency gains and losses have arisen from the remeasurement of non local currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities into the currency of the country in which the operation is domiciled 
these gains and losses  related primarily to trade receivable and payable balances  are included in other income  net 
additional information concerning foreign currency related matters is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s cost structure 
effect of changing pulp costs per ton pulp costs tend to be cyclical in nature and are a large component of product costs 
the company consumed approximately  and  metric tons of wood pulp in and  respectively  including requirements of the two companies acquired in  and  metric tons of wood pulp in during the period from january through december  the us list price of the primary pulp grade used by the company  northern bleached softwood kraft pulp  ranged from a low of per metric ton to a high of per metric ton  and increased to per metric ton in january generally  over time  the company has been able to increase its selling prices in response to increased per ton pulp costs and has generally reduced them when pulp costs have significantly declined 
the company may or may not be able to fully recover future pulp cost increases  or fully retain future pulp cost decreases  in its sales pricing structure 
seasonality sales of the company s products are not subject to seasonal fluctuations  except in the united states and brazil 
in the united states  customer shutdowns typically occur in july and december and typically have resulted in reduced net sales and operating profit during those two months 
additionally  the us mills shut down equipment to perform additional maintenance during these months  resulting in higher product costs and reduced operating profit 
in brazil  customer orders are typically lower in december due to a holiday season through much of january and february 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to the environmental impact of air  water and other emissions from its mills as well as its disposal of solid waste generated by its operations 
the company believes it is operating in compliance with  or is taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with  such laws and regulations 
while the company has incurred in the past several years  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations  these costs are not expected to materially affect the company s business or results of operations 
the company  or its predecessor  has been named as a potentially responsible party at several waste disposal sites  none of which  individually  or in the aggregate  in management s opinion  is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  there can be no assurance that such an effect will not occur at some future time 
additional information concerning environmental matters is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings herein 
legal proceedings information concerning legal proceedings is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings herein 
in addition  the company and its subsidiaries are involved in legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and  while it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against the company and its subsidiaries  management believes that such actions and claims will be resolved without a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
reliance on significant customers most of the company s customers are manufacturers of tobacco products located in more than countries around the world 
two such customers have accounted for a significant portion of the company s net sales in each of the last several years  and the loss of one or both such customers  or a significant reduction in one or both of these customers purchases  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
tobacco products and governmental actions in recent years  governmental entities  particularly in the united states  have taken or have proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing consumption of tobacco products 
reports and speculation with respect to the alleged harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking and use of tobacco products have been publicized for many years and  together with actions to restrict or prohibit advertising and promotion of cigarettes or other tobacco products and to increase taxes on such products  are intended to discourage the consumption of cigarettes and other such products 
in the fourth quarter of  the major us cigarette manufacturers reached agreement with all us states and several commonwealths and territories to settle health care cost recovery and other claims 
in anticipation of these settlements and as a direct result of these settlements  most of the us cigarette manufacturers have increased prices of cigarettes significantly 
domestic cigarette consumption has declined  in part due to these price increases which  in turn  decreases demand for the company s products 
during  the us department of justice filed a multi billion dollar civil suit against the tobacco industry 
in addition  litigation is pending against the major manufacturers of consumer tobacco products seeking damages for health problems allegedly resulting from the use of tobacco in various forms and for alleged violations of antitrust laws 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or what effect adverse developments in pending or future litigation may have on the tobacco industry  its financial liquidity or relationships with its suppliers 
nor is it possible to predict what additional legislation or regulations relating to tobacco products will be enacted  or to what extent  if any  such legislation or regulations might affect the consumer tobacco products industry in general 
approximately to percent of the company s net sales are from products used by the tobacco industry in the making and packaging of cigarettes or other tobacco products 
management is unable to predict the effects that the above described legal and governmental actions might have on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
forward looking statements certain sections of this report  particularly the foregoing discussion regarding the outlook of the company and factors that may affect future results  contain certain forward looking statements  generally identified by phrases such as the company expects or words of similar effect 
forward looking statements are made based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the company 
there can be no assurances that such events will occur or that the results of the company will be as estimated 
many factors outside the control of the company also could impact the realization of such estimates 
the above mentioned important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company
