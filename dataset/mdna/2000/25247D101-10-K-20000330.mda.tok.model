our international business segment accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
in the third quarter of  we acquired nuevo federal sa  a manufacturer and marketer of personal care and household products in argentina 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired three personal care soap brands and two laundry bar brands from the procter gamble company s argentinean subsidiary 
with these acquisitions  we entered what we believe is one of latin america s largest consumer markets by establishing a position in mercosur  a regional trading bloc with more than million consumers in argentina and neighboring countries  including brazil  paraguay  uruguay and chile

dial s commercial markets and other business segment accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
discontinued and divested brands by february  we had discontinued or divested product lines that were not within our core businesses 
under this strategy  in the third quarter of  we sold some of our household cleaning brands to church dwight for approximately million 
the sale included the following brands and related inventories brillo soap pads and related products  parsons ammonia  bo peep ammonia  sno bol toilet bowl cleaner  cameo metal polish and rain drops water softener 
our london  ohio  plant  where brillo was manufactured  also was part of the sale 
in addition  in the third quarter of  we sold our bruce floor care product trademark and our magic sizing starch brand and related inventories to other third parties for million 
in february  we sold the purex toss n soft brand to church dwight for million 
sales of these products in were insignificant 
in  these brands as well as discontinued brands generated net sales of approximately million  or approximately of our total net sales 
customers our products are sold throughout the united states primarily through supermarkets  mass merchandisers  drug stores  membership club stores and other outlets 
our top customers accounted for approximately  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
wal mart  including its affiliate  sam s club  was our largest customer  accounting for approximately  and of our net sales in  and  respectively

table of contents sales our customers are served by a national sales organization of approximately employees 
the sales organization is divided into four regions for grocery sales plus specialized sales operations that sell to large mass merchandisers  membership club stores  chain drug stores and vending and military customers 
in addition  some customers and regions  representing approximately of our net sales  are served by a national broker sales organization 
promotion and advertising a significant portion of our revenues are expended for trade discounts and the promotion and advertising of our products 
we believe that these expenditures are necessary to maintain and increase market shares in an industry highly dependent on product image and quality  trade support and consumer trends 
we incurred discounts and expenses for these purposes of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
this represents  and  of net sales in those years 
distribution we ship product from nine of our warehouses located at or near our domestic manufacturing and assembly facilities and four domestic regional distribution centers 
the regional warehouses are operated by third parties  except for one warehouse that we own and operate 
we use outside carriers to transport our products 
we have a just in time inventory management program of continuous  automatic replenishment of certain of our trade customers inventories 
the primary objective of this program is to improve service to our customers and reduce costs by shortening the order to delivery pipeline 
this occurs by anticipating customer needs based on historical sales  shipping the product just before those needs arise and eliminating redundancy  errors and interruption throughout the replenishment process 
sales under this program accounted for approximately of our net sales in each of  and suppliers we rely on a number of third parties for research and development  manufacturing and packaging 
many of our arrangements with respect to new products contain limited mutual exclusivity provisions 
this is designed to permit us and the supplier to profit from the product enhancement or innovation before we use an alternative supplier or the supplier sells to one of our competitors 
most of our outsourcing arrangements can be terminated without material penalties on an average of three months notice 
raw materials we believe that ample sources of raw materials are available with respect to all of our major products 
paper  fats and oils  detergent chemicals and meat have the most significant impact on our costs 
generally  we purchase these raw materials from a variety of suppliers in the united states 
while we believe that in certain circumstances we may be able to respond to price increases for certain raw materials by increasing sales prices  rapid increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact our profit margins and financial results 
for example  tallow a key ingredient in dial bar soaps has experienced price fluctuations within the range of and per pound from january   to december  recently  the price of tallow has been trading at the lower end of this historical range 
if prices were to increase  we may not be able to increase the prices of our dial bar soaps to offset these increases as readily as many competitors  which tend to use less tallow in their products 
in addition  we depend on a single supplier for triclosan  the antibacterial agent that is the active ingredient used in liquid dial products 
although we have an adequate supply of triclosan for our current and foreseeable needs  a significant disruption in this supply could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
we attempt to reduce our risk by entering into contracts to provide up to six to month supplies of tallow  triclosan and packaging materials 
during  we began using financial derivatives to mitigate price 
table of contents fluctuations on the raw material component of the cardboard boxes and packaging used in our business 
other long term hedging opportunities against price increases for these raw materials are generally not available 
competition we compete primarily on the basis of brand equity  brand advertising  customer service  product performance and product quality at competitive retail price points 
we compete with numerous  well established local  regional  national and international companies 
some of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and may be willing to commit significant resources to protecting their own market shares or to capturing market share from us 
our principal competitors are as follows soap category the procter gamble company p g lever brothers co  a division of unilever plc lever colgate palmolive company colgate household and air freshener sc johnson son  inc clorox co 
p g colgate reckitt colman inc canned meats hormel foods corp 
international home foods libby s detergent category p g lever colgate church dwight co  inc usa detergents  inc specialty personal care calgon and healing garden johnson johnson  inc yardley of london del laboratories  inc alberto culver research and development we conduct research and development at our facility in scottsdale  arizona 
our internal research and development efforts are directed at improving existing products  developing new products  and providing technical assistance and support to our manufacturing activities 
we rely on outside sources for general research and development activities 
our internal and external research and development expenditures were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
marketing research we rely on industry data  syndicated market share data  various attitude and usage studies prepared by independent marketing firms 
we also obtain direct sales information from our largest customers to identify consumer needs and anticipate shifts in consumer preferences 
this allows us to develop line extensions and new products to meet changing demands 
patents and trademarks our trademarks include dial  purex  renuzit  armour  armour star  freeman  sarah michaels  tone  nature s accents  pure natural  breck  trend  treet  mule team and boraxo and related trade names 
we license the armour and armour star trademarks from conagra  inc which also sells non canned food products under the armour trademark 
we license the mule team trademark from us borax  inc 
table of contents united states trademark registrations are for a term of years  renewable every years so long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade 
we maintain a portfolio of trademarks representing substantial goodwill in the businesses using these trademarks 
we also have a significant number of registered foreign trademarks and pending foreign trademark applications 
united states patents are currently granted for a term of years from the date a patent application is filed 
we own a number of patents that provide competitive advantages in the marketplace 
government regulation substantially all of our operations are  or may become  subject to various federal laws and agency regulations 
these include the food  drug  and cosmetic act  which is administered by the food and drug administration the fda 
the fda regulates the manufacturing  labeling  and sale of our over the counter drug and cosmetic products 
the insecticide  fungicide  and rodenticide act and the toxic substances control act are administered by the environmental protection agency and regulate our disinfectant products and certain of the substances used in the manufacturing of our products 
the meat inspection act is administered by the department of agriculture and regulates our meat products 
the hazardous substances act is administered by the consumer product safety commission and regulates the labeling of the company s household products 
the fair packaging and labeling act is administered by the federal trade commission the ftc and regulates the packaging and labeling of all of our products 
our products also are subject to regulation by various state laws and various state regulatory agencies 
in addition  we are subject to similar laws and regulations imposed by foreign jurisdictions 
since the s  the food and drug administration has regulated antibacterial soaps and hand washes under a proposed regulation 
although the proposed regulation has not been finalized  the fda ultimately could set standards that result in limiting or even precluding soap manufacturers from using some current antibacterial ingredients or making antibacterial claims for some product forms  such as bar soap 
dial  which uses the antibacterial ingredient triclosan in liquid dial and triclocarban in dial bar soap  emphasizes the antibacterial properties of its soap products in its marketing campaigns and product labeling 
any final fda regulation that limits or precludes this type of advertising could require dial to develop new marketing campaigns  develop new products or utilize different antibacterial ingredients in its products  all of which could materially adversely affect our business 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of environmental and health and safety laws in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
these laws and regulations pertain to our present and past operations 
although we currently do not anticipate that the costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial results or condition  the emergence of unforeseen claims or liabilities or the imposition of increasingly stringent laws  regulations and enforcement policies could result in material  unreserved costs in the future 
since  we have received notices or requests for information with respect to superfund sites under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  five of which are currently active 
as of december   we have accrued in our financial statements approximately million in reserves for expenses related to superfund sites and the clean up of closed plant sites 
we believe our reserves are adequate  but these costs are difficult to predict with certainty 
we do not currently anticipate that we will incur significant capital expenditures in connection with matters relating to environmental control or compliance in we do not anticipate that the costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations or the costs related to superfund sites and the clean up of closed plant sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial results or condition 
however  there can be no assurance that other developments  such as the emergence of unforeseen claims or liabilities or the imposition of increasingly stringent laws  regulations and enforcement policies will not result in material costs in the future 

table of contents federal  state  local and foreign environmental compliance may from time to time require changes in product formulation or packaging 
these changes have not had  and are not expected to have  a material adverse effect on our financial results or condition 
employees we employed approximately  individuals  of whom approximately  were covered by collective bargaining agreements  as of december  four of our seven plants in the united states are unionized

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview for organizational  marketing  financial reporting and method of distribution  we have organized our business into three segments domestic branded  international and commercial markets and other 
beginning with  our fiscal year end is december prior to  our fiscal year ended on the saturday closest to the end of december 
fiscal years and consisted of weeks while fiscal year consisted of weeks 
recent developments we recently announced that we expect our earnings to be down for the first half of versus our plan and the same period a year ago 
we believe certain events leading to these lower than expected earnings will impact both sales and gross margin for the first and second quarters of we believe that the factors relating to the sales shortfall are primarily the consolidation and balancing of inventory that occurred when our second largest customer converted from buying direct to buying through two wholesalers  the continuing price war between two of our competitors in the premium segment of the argentina detergent market which has had an adverse impact on dial s value brand detergent in argentina  a shortfall on the sale of armour canned meats due to increased yk related retail inventory buildup at year s end  coupled with a price increase taken by dial in january that has not been matched by competition 
in addition  our sales are now lower and the mix of products sold is different than earlier anticipated and this could have an adverse impact on our gross margin and earnings 
our gross margin in the first half will be impacted by the reduced manufacturing overhead absorption associated with the lower than expected sales volumes and the increasing cost of petroleum that affects  among other things  transportation and distribution expenses 
see additional discussion of matters that may impact our results in factors that may affect future results and financial condition

liquidity and capital resources we generated cash from operations of million during compared to cash generated of million during the same period in the decrease resulted primarily from higher accounts receivable and an increase in inventories due to new products and a slight build up at year end as a year contingency 
the decrease was partially offset by improvements in net income  higher depreciation expense attributable to information technology software and amortization of freeman and sarah michaels goodwill 
capital expenditures for were million versus million for the comparable period in capital spending in is expected to approximate million and will be concentrated primarily on equipment and information systems that provide opportunities to reduce manufacturing  logistic and administrative costs

the agreement also provides for commitment fees 
these spreads and fees may change should our debt ratings change 
we make use of short term bank borrowings when needed 
the borrowings are unsecured and generally have maturities between and days and bear interest at libor plus appropriate spreads 
the banks that provide the borrowings do so on an uncommitted basis 
beginning in the third quarter of  short term bank borrowings  previously classified as long term debt because they were supported by the credit agreement  are being classified as short term debt because the credit agreement is being used to support our commercial paper program

the acquisition price reflects a million reduction in the purchase price for freeman as a result of a net worth adjustment received in january on september   we acquired sarah michaels for million in cash  which was financed through short term borrowings supported by our long term credit agreement 
on september   we completed a million public offering of senior notes due the proceeds of the debt financing were used to repay outstanding bank borrowings used for the acquisitions of freeman and sarah michaels 
the indenture governing these senior notes imposes restrictions on us with respect to  among other things  our ability to redeem the senior notes  to place liens on certain properties and to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions

in july  the joint venture acquired the custom cleaner  inc home dry cleaning business 
in december  the joint venture launched purex advanced 
we include our share of the joint venture operating results in our financial statements using the equity method of accounting 
in  our share of the loss in the joint venture was million 
the joint venture net sales for  although not consolidated in our financial statements  were million 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we will be required to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of this statement requires that all derivatives be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value 
the statement requires that changes in a derivatives s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we are still in the process of evaluating this statement and the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
our future results and financial condition are dependent upon our ability to successfully develop  manufacture and market consumer products 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that we must 
table of contents successfully manage to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our future operating results and financial condition include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
we face intense competition in a mature industry that may require us to increase expenditures and lower profit margins to preserve or maintain our market share 
currently  we depend primarily on sales generated in us markets of sales in 
us markets for consumer products are mature and characterized by high household penetration  particularly with respect to our most significant product categories  including detergents and bar soaps 
we may not be able to succeed in implementing our strategies to increase domestic revenues 
our unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increasing usage by consumers  product innovation and capturing market share from competitors 
the consumer products industry  particularly the detergent  personal care and air freshener categories  is intensely competitive 
to protect our existing market share or to capture increased market share  we may need to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and to introduce and establish new products 
additional expenditures could lower our profit margins 
moreover  these additional measures and increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share 
for example  we recently formed a joint venture with henkel kgaa to introduce enhanced laundry products 
this joint venture recently introduced purex advanced  an enzyme based detergent  and began a national rollout of custom cleaner  a home dry cleaning product 
if sales for these new products do not meet expectations  it would adversely impact our expected operating results for many of our competitors are large companies  including the procter gamble company  lever brothers co  colgate palmolive company  and sc johnson son  inc  which have greater financial resources than we do 
they could outspend us in an attempt to take market share from us 
price cutting measures in response to competitive pressures could result in decreased profit margins 
consumer products  particularly those that are value priced  are subject to significant price competition 
from time to time  we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and consumer pressures and to maintain market share 
if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins  our results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
our inability to provide price concessions or trade terms that are acceptable to our trade customers could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
because of the competitive environment facing retailers  we face pricing pressure from these customers 
many of our trade customers  particularly our high volume retail store customers  have increasingly sought to reduce inventory levels and obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms 
if we are unable to maintain price or trade terms that are acceptable to our trade customers  they could increase product purchases from our competitors  which would adversely affect our sales and profitability 
in addition  consolidation within the retail industry could potentially reduce inventory levels maintained by our retail customers which could adversely impact our operating results 
our performance is also dependent upon the general health of the retail environment and could be materially affected by changes affecting retailing and by the financial difficulties of retailers 
loss of our principal customers could significantly decrease our sales and profitability 
our top ten customers accounted for of net sales in wal mart  including its affiliate sam s club  was our largest customer  accounting for of net sales in the loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by wal mart or any of our other top customers could have a material adverse effect on sales and profitability 
price increases in certain raw materials could adversely affect our profit margins 
rapid increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact our profit margins 
for example  tallow a key ingredient in dial bar soaps has experienced price fluctuations within the range of and per pound from january   to december  recently  the price of tallow has been 
table of contents trading at the lower end of this historical range 
if prices were to increase  we may not be able to increase the prices of our dial bar soaps to offset these increases as readily as many competitors  which tend to use less tallow in their products 
in addition  we depend on a single supplier for triclosan  the antibacterial agent that is the active ingredient used in liquid dial products 
although we have an adequate supply of triclosan for our current and foreseeable needs  a significant disruption in this supply could have a short term material adverse impact on our financial results 
our international expansion efforts may prove unsuccessful 
in  of our sales were generated in us markets 
we have adopted a strategy to continue to penetrate international markets to supplement our domestic revenues 
however  there can be no assurance that we will succeed in increasing our international business in a profitable manner 
in implementing this strategy  we face barriers to entry and the risk of competition from local and other companies that already have established global businesses  risks generally associated with conducting business internationally  including exposure to currency fluctuations  limitations on foreign investment  import export controls  nationalization  unstable governments and legal systems  and the additional expense and risks inherent in operating in geographically and culturally diverse locations 
because we plan to develop our international business through acquisitions as well as joint ventures  co packaging arrangements and or other alliances  we also may be subject to risks associated with such arrangements  including those relating to the combining of different corporate cultures and shared decision making 
in addition  since our current international distribution capabilities are extremely limited  we also may need to acquire a distribution network or enter into alliances with existing distributors before we can effectively conduct operations in new markets 
the fda could impose standards that negatively impact our ability to market some of our products as antibacterial 
since the s  the food and drug administration has regulated antibacterial soaps and hand washes under a proposed regulation 
although the proposed regulation has not been finalized  the fda ultimately could set standards that result in limiting or even precluding soap manufacturers from using some current antibacterial ingredients or making antibacterial claims for some product forms  such as bar soap 
dial  which uses the antibacterial ingredient triclosan in liquid dial and triclocarban in dial bar soap  emphasizes the antibacterial properties of its soap products in its marketing campaigns and product labeling 
any final fda regulation that limits or precludes this type of advertising could require dial to develop new marketing campaigns  develop new products or utilize different antibacterial ingredients in its products  all of which could materially adversely affect our business 
we could become the subject of adverse publicity or product recalls that negatively impacts our operations 
adverse publicity regarding our products could impact the sales of our products 
some news broadcasts by major us television and radio networks have focused on the use of antibacterial agents to kill germs on various surfaces 
triclosan  the active ingredient in liquid dial  also has been a focus of these broadcasts 
although none of the broadcasts disputed that triclosan kills germs on the skin  some third party experts did question whether it provides any additional protection beyond that provided by nonantibacterial soap products 
although we have test results that we believe prove that triclosan provides consumers with additional protection in limiting exposure to bacteria related diseases  there can be no assurance that our triclosan products  or other products  will not be the subject of adverse publicity in the future 
from time to time  consumer product companies  including dial  have had to recall certain products for various reasons 
the costs of recall or other related liabilities could materially lower our profit margins 
adverse publicity regarding any product recalls also could materially affect our sales 
we share the use of the armour trademark for food products with conagra inc  the manufacturer of armour branded non canned meat products 
accordingly  we face the added risk that consumer preferences and perceptions with respect to any of our armour products may be influenced by adverse publicity affecting any of the armour branded products of conagra  inc 
table of contents we may incur unexpected expenses due to environmental concerns regarding a detergent compound 
nonlyphenol ethoxylate is an ingredient used in our liquid and powder detergent products 
certain environmental and regulatory groups have raised concerns regarding the toxicity of compounds produced from nonlyphenol ethoxylate as it decomposes and the adverse impact on the reproductive health of certain aquatic animals exposed to those compounds 
although to our knowledge none of the studies undertaken on nonlyphenol ethoxylate has demonstrated a link between the compound and such effect in the environment or in human beings  there can be no assurance that subsequent studies will not in fact demonstrate such a link or demonstrate other adverse environmental consequences 
current government regulations do not impose any restrictions on the use of nonlyphenol ethoxylate  or impose any liability on any of the businesses that utilize nonlyphenol ethoxylate in the products they manufacture 
we believe  however  that a number of governmental agencies in north america and europe are discussing formal regulation of nonlyphenol ethoxylate in the environment 
we are in the process of reformulating our detergents to eliminate this compound as an ingredient 
we may incur unexpected expenses due to environmental matters 
we are subject to a variety of environmental and health and safety laws in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
these laws and regulations pertain to our present and past operations 
although we currently do not anticipate that the costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position  the emergence of unforeseen claims or liabilities or the imposition of increasingly stringent laws  regulations and enforcement policies could result in material  unreserved costs in the future 
since  we have received notices or requests for information with respect to superfund sites under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  five of which are currently active 
as of december   we have accrued in our financial statements approximately million in reserves for expenses related to superfund sites and the clean up of closed plant sites 
we believe our reserves are adequate  but these costs are difficult to predict with certainty 
loss of key managerial personnel could negatively impact our operations 
our operation requires managerial expertise 
of our key personnel  only the chief executive officer has an employment contract with us 
there can be no assurance that any of our key employees will remain in our employ 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we may make acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources 
we recently acquired two consumer products companies  freeman cosmetic corporation and sarah michaels  and formed a joint venture company with henkel kgaa 
in addition  the joint venture company formed with henkel recently acquired the custom cleaner home dry cleaning business 
we may acquire or make substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future 
the freeman  sarah michaels and custom cleaner acquisitions entailed  and any future acquisitions or investments would entail  various risks  including the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and  generally  our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
for example  during we will consolidate our sarah michaels  freeman cosmetics and nature s accents businesses 
this consolidation could have a short term impact on the sales and profit margin of these businesses  which could adversely impact our expected operating results for our future acquisitions and investments also could result in substantial cash expenditures  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities  and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could adversely affect our financial results and condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion of our exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to us 
nevertheless  because of the unpredictability of interest rates  foreign currency rates and commodity prices  and other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward looking information 
our use of financial instruments is limited to purposes other than trading and primarily includes management of employee benefits and commodity expense 
we may use financial instruments for the management of interest rate  foreign currency or other risks in the future 
interest rate risk we have short term debt  short term bank borrowings  a commercial paper program supported by a long term revolving credit agreement and a receivables purchase and sale program which subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
at december   we had million in short term borrowings outstanding including million in borrowings by our argentinean subsidiary  million in receivables sold but not collected and million in long term debt outstanding 
of the long term debt outstanding  million is fixed rate debt and  accordingly  does not expose us to risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates 
both the short term debt of million and the remaining million of commercial paper issuances which are classified as long term debt because they are supported by the long term credit agreement have maturities of between one and days 
accordingly  the interest rates associated with those borrowings reset as the borrowings mature and are renewed 
in addition  the receivables purchase and sale program allows us to sell our trade receivables prior to collection at a discount that closely approximates the day london interbank borrowing rate libor 
this discount rate reprices monthly 
at december   the short term debt had a weighted average interest rate of  the commercial paper issuances had a weighted average interest rate of  and the discount paid on the sale of receivables program was 
if the floating rates were to change by from december   levels  annual interest expense associated with the floating rate debt would change by approximately million before tax and the annual discount paid for the sale of receivables not yet collected would change by approximately  before tax 
foreign currency we are subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily us dollar canadian dollar  us dollar mexican peso and us dollar argentinean peso 
the argentinean peso s value has been pegged by the argentinean government as equal to the us dollar 
through december   this currency equivalency applied 
however  there can be no assurance in the future that the argentinean government will continue this policy or have the ability to ensure that the value of the argentinean peso will continue to equal the us dollar 
at december   one us dollar was worth canadian dollars and mexican pesos  respectively 
for the year ended december   the us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuated between a high of c to c and the us dollar mexican peso exchange rate fluctuated between p and a low of p 
if there were a change in the exchange rates for the us dollar to the canadian dollar  the mexican peso and the argentinean peso from those at december   we would have an annual currency translation gain or loss of approximately million before tax 

table of contents commodity price risk in the manufacture of our products we utilize a number of commodities  such as tallow  coconut oil and meat 
in addition  we use a variety of products that are priced based on underlying commodities  such as plastic bottles resin 
in the normal course of business  we attempt to enter into supply agreements that generally fix or set a range of prices of goods to be purchased 
these supply agreements can cover up to months of supply for goods 
financial derivatives to hedge or lock in the prices of these commodities over the long term greater than one year generally are not available 
we do utilize financial derivatives to fix the price of the raw material component of the cardboard boxes and packaging we use in our business 
our purchase contracts with our cardboard box suppliers have provisions that allow the raw material component of the box price to reset based on movements in the price of cardboard 
this component is based on the pulp paper week lb 
linerboard price index 
we have entered into a series of contracts for covering a notional amount of  tons that allow us to pay a weighted average fixed price per ton of cardboard of and receive payments based on the pulp paper week index 
at december   the pulp paper week index price was ton 
open contracts had a fair market loss associated with them of approximately employee benefit plan expense we offer our directors and management deferred compensation plans 
under these plans  participants can defer a portion of their compensation into dial stock units 
deferred compensation due to participants and any accumulated investment gains or losses is included on the balance sheet as a liability under the caption pension and other benefits 
we place the deferred funds in a rabbi trust  which purchases life insurance policies on the participants lives  with dial as the beneficiary 
the policies have a cash surrender value that accrue tax free earnings based on the performance of the s p the cash surrender value asset and any accumulated investment gains or losses is included on the balance sheet as an asset under the caption other assets 
to the extent that the return on dial shares is different from that of the s p  income or expense is generated by the plans 
we have entered into a contract with a financial institution that provides for an exchange of payments based on the relative performance of our common shares and the s p the contract has a notional amount of  dial common shares and  s p futures contracts and is renewable quarterly 
at the time of renewal  the index price of dial shares and the s p resets to the current market price 
any income or loss generated by the contract is recognized in the income statement and offsets the income statement impact of the deferred compensation plan 
because the contract renews near the end of each quarter  its market value at the end of each quarter and accordingly  at december  approximates zero
