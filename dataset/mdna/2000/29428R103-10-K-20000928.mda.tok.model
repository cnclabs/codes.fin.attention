as of september   the company had invested approximately million in internet related businesses 
of the million  the company invested approximately million on behalf of venture i 
prior to the company s change in business strategy  the company had been actively engaged  through its subsidiaries  in the gaming industry for over years 
the company is one of the largest gaming machine route operators in the state of nevada  and is an established leader in the operation of gaming machines in multiple retail locations route operations 
in connection with its change in business strategy  the company has retained the investment banking firm of koffler company to advise the company on the disposition of its gaming business segment 
during the quarter ended june   management formalized its plan to sell the route operations and commenced activities to dispose of such operations 
on july   the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its route operations for million in cash 
as a result of the sale  which is subject to closing conditions and regulatory and other approvals  the financial position and results of operations of the route operations have been reported as discontinued operations 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to discontinued operations  previously reported financial statements have been reclassified to reflect the route operations as discontinued 
the company expects to complete the closing of the sale during the quarter ending december  at various times during the past several years  the company engaged in the active consideration of potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities in both the gaming and nongaming markets  including most recently in in connection with the potential acquisition of players international  inc players and crc holdings  inc d b a carnival resorts casinos crc  a privately owned company 
the company devoted significant management and other resources to these efforts and incurred substantial expenses in connection with such activities 
the discussion that follows is based on giving retroactive effect to the discontinued operations 
since the route operations was the company s only business segment from its inception through february  the following discussion focuses primarily on jackpot s continuing operations  which consisted primarily of the activities of the parent company for the periods discussed in this report 
results of operations special factors affecting discontinued operations albertson s raley s litigation 
in august  albertson s  inc albertson s  a retail chain in which jackpot conducts gaming operations and american stores company american stores entered into a merger agreement that provided for the acquisition of american stores by albertson s 
approximately  and of revenues generated by discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended june   and referred to herein as  and  respectively were generated at the locations of those two entities 
the merger of albertson s and american stores was completed on june  as a condition to avoiding and or settling legal proceedings against the merger by the federal trade commission and the attorneys general of california  nevada and new mexico  albertson s agreed to divest certain of its stores  including stores in southern nevada  fifteen of which were jackpot locations 
in late september and early october  albertson s sold those locations to raley s  inc raley s  and raley s has operated them since 
on august   jackpot commenced litigation in united states district court for the district of nevada against albertson s and raley s to enforce its rights to remain in the fifteen locations under its agreement with albertson s 
on september   jackpot obtained a preliminary injunction to prevent albertson s and raley s from interfering with its right to occupy the subject premises and conduct gaming operations 
albertson s and raley s appealed the injunction and made motions for summary judgment 
in connection with raley s acquisition of the locations  united coin machine company united coin  the slot route operator for raley s northern nevada stores  filed applications with the nevada gaming control board to operate the gaming machines at the fifteen stores 
on september   united coin commenced an action in nevada state court against jackpot  albertson s  raley s and anchor coin anchor  the slot route operator at the four other albertson s southern nevada locations seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and money damages 
on january   jackpot entered into a settlement agreement and release the settlement agreement with albertson s  raley s  anchor and united coin 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  the parties agreed to dismiss with prejudice all litigation pending among them and to the takeover of gaming operations by united coin of the stores in southern nevada  effective february  of the stores in southern nevada operated by raley s  jackpot had operated gaming machines at locations pursuant to its long term agreement with albertson s 
these locations generated approximately of revenues  and a significantly greater percentage of operating income of discontinued operations in jackpot believed it was in its best interest to settle the case and thereby preserve and solidify its long term relationship with albertson s  its largest customer  pursuant to the terms of an amendment to its agreement with albertson s  which it had theretofore arranged and which is described below 
it was also important to jackpot to avoid further litigation and fully resolve all claims among and between the parties 
all costs incurred in connection with the litigation and settlement  including legal and settlement costs aggregating approximately  were recorded in  and are included in the line captioned income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
settlement agreement with albertson s 
prior to the settlement described above  on november   jackpot and albertson s had entered into a settlement agreement the agreement 
the agreement amended the license agreement entered in september between jackpot and albertson s the albertson s agreement 
the agreement also terminated jackpot s separate license agreements with lucky stores  inc and american drug stores  inc 
and incorporates jackpot s exclusive rights in nevada to operate gaming devices at the locations including any future locations of those entities into the albertson s agreement  as amended by the agreement 
under the agreement  jackpot has the exclusive option to extend the agreements beyond their initial terms and will continue to have exclusive gaming rights for new albertson s locations 
in addition  albertson s granted jackpot exclusive gaming rights in all drug stores opened by albertson s or any of its affiliates in nevada  and in future fuel center locations  a new retailing concept that albertson s will open  in which gaming may be offered to customers 
further  pursuant to the terms of the agreement  jackpot received certain immediate credits toward license fees  and will receive substantial reductions in certain license fees  which are effective from february  through the initial term of the agreement 
based upon the amended terms and certain assumptions  management believes that the estimated cost savings over the initial term of the agreement will approximate million 
the rite aid dispute 
on december   certain route operations subsidiaries of jackpot commenced litigation in the united states district court for the district of nevada against rite aid corporation rite aid 
the lawsuit is an action for rescission of two license agreements between those subsidiaries and rite aid and for damages based upon rite aid s alleged fraud 
operations of said subsidiaries under said agreements resulted in an operating loss of approximately million in on march   jackpot entered into amendments to the two license agreements with rite aid 
based on the number of existing locations at which jackpot currently operates gaming machines  license fees payable to rite aid have been reduced by approximately million annually over the remaining term of the amended agreements 
the amendments are subject to certain administrative approvals from the nevada state gaming control board nevada board for rite aid locations 
the company has recently received verbal approval from the nevada board for rite aid locations  and management expects to receive verbal approval for the remaining stores shortly 
based upon verbal approval of the majority of the company s rite aid locations  management anticipates that the company will receive the administrative approvals from the nevada board for the rite aid locations in october upon the receipt of the administrative approvals  the amendments will become effective 
based upon management s belief that such approval will be received shortly  the company has recorded the license fees at their reduced rates  effective march  further  upon such approval  all disputes between the parties  including jackpot s lawsuit against rite aid  will be resolved or settled 
on april   the court ordered that all scheduling deadlines previously set in the case were stayed pending the filing of a stipulation and order of dismissal by the parties 
further  because the amended agreements are conditioned upon certain administrative approvals by the nevada board  the parties were permitted to file the stipulation for dismissal by september   which has been extended to october  based upon the reduction in license fees described above  the company s operating losses at the rite aid locations should decrease substantially 
however  even with the license fee reductions  management believes that the company will continue to incur losses  and such losses may be significant  unless revenues increase significantly at these locations 
compared to revenues the company had no revenues from continuing operations in and costs and expenses costs and expenses of jackpot s continuing operations  which consisted principally of parent company general and administrative activities  increased million  from million in to million in the increase of million was due primarily to million of severance costs paid to the former chief executive officer 
other income expense other income  net increased million  from million in to million in the increase of million was due principally to the net fee from the terminated merger of million and the gain on the sale of the players common stock of million 
federal income tax the effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
these rates were lower than the federal statutory rate of principally because of the tax benefits realized from tax exempt interest income 
net income loss from continuing operations net income from continuing operations increased million  from a net loss of million in to net income of million in diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations for was 
per share versus 
per share for such increases were due principally to the increase in other income relating to the net fee from the terminated merger and the gain on the sale of the players common stock 
income from discontinued operations  net of tax income from discontinued operations  net of tax  decreased million  from million in to 
million in such decrease was due principally to three factors a significant decline in income generated at former albertson s locations in southern nevada  which have been operated by raley s since late september and early october such decline was due primarily to i significantly lower revenues generated at these locations and ii the loss of such locations on february   an operating loss of approximately million in incurred at the locations of rite aid  a large customer  resulting from the failure of new locations to achieve expected revenues  as well as from a decrease in revenues at existing locations of such customer  and legal and settlement costs incurred in connection with jackpot s litigation against albertson s and raley s 
net income net income increased million  from million in to million in diluted earnings per share for was 
per share versus

million in net income principally as a result of the owl club casino and the crc charges  net income and diluted earnings per share in decreased to million and 
per share  respectively  from million and 
per share in capital resources and liquidity liquidity on october   jackpot s board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to  shares of jackpot s common stock at prevailing market prices 
subsequently  on january   such authorization was increased from  to  shares 
from october  through august   jackpot has repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
on august   jackpot received a notice from players terminating the agreement and plan of merger dated february  the players agreement 
such notice contained the terms of a merger offer for players from harrah s entertainment  inc on august   pursuant to the terms of the players agreement  jackpot received a break up fee of million 
as a result of the termination of the players agreement  capitalized costs of million incurred in connection with the proposed acquisition of players were expensed resulting in a net break up fee of million 
during  jackpot sold  shares of players common stock for million 
as a result of the sale of such shares  which were purchased on march  at a cost of million  jackpot realized a gain of million 
as described previously  the company has recently raised approximately million through the issuance of unregistered convertible subordinated notes  and expects to raise an additional million 
subject to the successful completion of such financing discussed above  management believes the company s working capital will be sufficient to enable jackpot to fund its million commitment to venture i  and to meet its operating and other cash requirements for the year ending june  cash flows jackpot s principal source of cash for  and was the net cash provided by discontinued operations 
in addition  the break up fee of million from a terminated merger with players and proceeds of million received in june from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes provided other significant sources of cash 
net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations in was million 
such inflow resulted primarily from the receipt of the break up fee from the terminated merger with players and the proceeds from the sale of players stock described below less cash used of million for investments in internet related businesses 
from march through june   the company directly and on behalf of venture i invested million in internet related businesses 
such outflows consisted of million in cash and million of non cash consideration  primarily in the form of the company s common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million  and consisted of net proceeds received from the issuance of unregistered convertible subordinated notes and common stock upon the exercise of stock options of approximately million and 
million  respectively 
as a result of the combination of net cash provided by operating activities  investing activities and financing activities of 
million  
million and million  respectively  cash and cash equivalents increased million in net cash provided by operating activities in and consisted principally of net cash provided by discontinued operations of million and million  respectively 
such proceeds were used to fund all investing and financing activities in and with respect to  net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was million  and resulted primarily from the purchase of marketable securities of million 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  and resulted from payments for repurchases of common stock of million  net of proceeds received of approximately 
million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options

as a result of the combination of net cash provided by operating activities of million less net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations and financing activities of million and million  respectively  cash and cash equivalents increased million in recently issued accounting standards in april  the american institute of certified public accountants accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position no 
 reporting on the costs of start up activities 
this standard provides guidance on the financial reporting for start up costs and organization costs 
this standard requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
the company adopted this standard on july  this statement did not have any effect on jackpot s results of operations or its financial position 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas establishes additional accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position 
this statement also defines and allows companies to apply hedge accounting to its designated derivatives under certain instances 
it also requires that all derivatives be marked to market on an ongoing basis 
this applies whether the derivatives are stand alone instruments  such as warrants or interest rate swaps  or embedded derivatives  such as call options contained in convertible debt investments 
along with the derivatives  in the case of qualifying hedges  the underlying hedged items are also to be marked to market 
these market value adjustments are to be included either in the income statement or other comprehensive income  depending on the nature of the hedged transaction 
the fair value of financial instruments is generally determined by reference to market values resulting from trading on a national securities exchange or in an over the counter market 
in cases where derivatives relate to financial instruments of non public companies  or where quoted market prices are otherwise not available  such as for derivative financial instruments  fair value is based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques 
the company will adopt the standard in the quarter ending september  and will record its derivatives on july  at fair market value 
in addition  any increase or decrease from historical cost basis of its derivatives on that date will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter ending september  based on management s review  the company expects the most significant impact of this standard will be the cumulative effect adjustment as well as ongoing marked to market adjustments related to the warrants that it received to purchase techtrader  inc common stock in connection with the company s purchase of series b preferred stock 
the value of these warrants can fluctuate given that techtrader is a non public company 
at june   the estimated value of the warrants was approximately million 
under sfas  the warrants will be revalued each quarter and the change in value of the warrants will be included in the consolidated statement of income 
under current accounting principles  the change in value of these warrants is not recorded 
the cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas will be approximately  in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab clarifies existing accounting principles related to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company is required to comply with the provisions of sab in its quarter ending june  based upon the current nature of the company s continuing operations  management does not believe that sab will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation fin  which provides clarification on the application of accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
the company is required to comply with the provisions of fin beginning july  based upon management s review  the company does not expect that the application will have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
factors which may affect future results with its change in business strategy  the company will be operating in a significantly different environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties 
some factors including  but not limited to the following  may affect the company s future results of operations the company s ability to successfully execute its new business model  the development of the internet and the infrastructure that supports it  the company s success may depend greatly on increased use of the internet by businesses and individuals  the ability of the company s investees to compete against direct and indirect competitors  the company s ability to acquire interests in additional internet related businesses  the ability of the company s investees to raise additional capital  and changes in the market for securities of internet related businesses in general and for initial public offerings of internet companies in particular 
by their very nature  the entities in which the company has and will be investing capital will be in an earlier stage of development and maturity  and therefore a different level of risk and reward 
all of the company s investments in internet related businesses are in non public companies 
substantially all such companies are development stage companies and are presently incurring operating losses 
there can be no assurance that such companies will generate operating income in the future 
year in the past  many computer software programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this situation has been referred to as the year problem 
the company s essential systems were year compliant prior to december  all costs related to the year problem have been expensed as incurred  while the cost of new hardware is capitalized and amortized over its expected useful life 
as of december   the company had incurred approximately  of year compliance costs  principally for internal costs and system applications 
subsequent to december   the company has not experienced any significant difficulties  or incurred any significant costs relating to the year problem  and continues to monitor its essential computer systems and other systems for potential problems which may occur 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is generally exposed to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates 
the company s interest income is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
changes in us interest rates could affect interest earned on the company s cash equivalents  debt instruments and money market funds 
a majority of the interest earning instruments earn a fixed rate of interest over short periods days 
based upon the invested balances at june   a drop in interest rates would reduce pretax interest income by approximately  per year 
therefore  the company does not anticipate that exposure to interest rate market risk will have a material impact on the company due to the nature of the company s investments 
during the year ended june   the company sold a total of  shares of common stock of players in open market transactions 
such shares  which were purchased on march   were acquired because the purchase price for those shares was significantly below the per share consideration which the company had agreed to pay for all outstanding shares of players pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of february   which provided for the merger of players into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
as of june   jackpot did not own any shares of players common stock 
for further information concerning the termination of the merger with players and the sale of players common stock by the company  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
except for the purchase described above  jackpot invests its available cash in marketable municipal bonds and money market funds 
no trading portfolios are available for the sale of these investments 
therefore  item a disclosure is not applicable for these investments 
in june  the company raised  through the issuance of unregistered convertible subordinated notes the notes 
the principal amount of the notes is payable on march  and bears interest at per annum  payable on a quarterly basis 
for financial statement purposes  the notes were deemed to have been beneficially converted as the conversion feature was in the money at the commitment date 
the company has calculated the beneficial conversion feature as the difference between the fair value of the common stock at the commitment date and the initial conversion price  multiplied by the number of shares into which the debt is convertible 
approximately  of the proceeds from issuance of the notes  equal to the intrinsic value  has been recorded as debt discount and allocated to additional paid in capital 
management believes that the carrying value of the notes approximates fair value 
beginning july   with the company s adoption of sfas  the company expects to have one derivative instrument in the form of warrants to purchase common stock in a non public company 
there is currently no public market for these warrants 
however  a change in the value of the warrants based upon the company s valuation of the warrants using black scholes valuation techniques would affect earnings by
