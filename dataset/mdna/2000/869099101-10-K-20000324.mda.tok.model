in particular  this document includes forward looking statements relating  but not limited to  susquehanna s potential exposures to various types of market risks  such as interest rate risk and credit risk 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
for example  certain of the market risk disclosures are dependent on choices about key model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations 
by their nature  certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future 
as a result  future income gains and losses could materially differ from those that have been estimated 
other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by the forward looking statements contained in this document include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions in market areas which susquehanna has significant business activities or investments  the monetary and interest rate policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  inflation  deflation  unanticipated turbulence in interest rates  changes in laws  regulations and taxes  changes in competition and pricing environments  natural disasters  the inability to hedge certain risks economically  the adequacy of loss reserves  acquisitions or restructurings  technological changes  changes in consumer spending and saving habits  and the success of susquehanna in managing the risks involved in the foregoing 
results of operations summary of compared to several significant transactions occurred which affected the comparability of susquehanna s financial performance for the years ended december  and these transactions are described in the following paragraphs 
on january   susquehanna announced that it recognized million of pre tax special charges relating to the consolidation of susquehanna s back office operations and a special bonus 
the restructure charge of million represents severance  employee and employment assistance services  consulting  and asset write offs related to a reduction in the work force 
this reduction in the work force should result in an estimated net annual savings of million  of which approximately will be realized in the year with realization in years after the special bonus is awarded to susquehanna employees excluding executive and senior management for extraordinary efforts in on january   susquehanna acquired first capitol bank  a pennsylvania commercial bank with million in assets and million in deposits at the acquisition date 
susquehanna issued  shares of its common stock to the shareholders of first capitol based upon an exchange ratio of shares of susquehanna common stock for each outstanding share of first capitol 
the transaction was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting  accordingly  the consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the consolidated accounts of first capitol for all periods presented 
on december   susquehanna acquired cardinal bancorp  inc cardinal  a pennsylvania bank holding company with million in assets and million in deposits at the acquisition date 
susquehanna issued  shares of its common stock to the shareholders of cardinal based upon an exchange ratio of shares of susquehanna common stock for each outstanding share of cardinal 
the transaction was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting  accordingly  the consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the consolidated accounts of cardinal for all periods presented 
susquehanna s net income for the year ended december   decreased to million  or below net income of million 
excluding the special charges noted above  susquehanna s net income for would have been million  or a increase over annual earnings 
susquehanna s earnings performance was affected by significant growth in non interest income resulting primarily from the purchase of certain insurance related products  such as bank owned life insurance boli  and a one time million pre tax gain on the sale of two branch offices 
non interest income increased million  or  in over diluted earnings per common share eps  were in compared to in excluding the special charges noted above  susquehanna s diluted eps would have been for  higher than diluted eps

income from interest earning assets includes income from loans and leases  income from investment securities  and income from short term investments 
the amount of interest income is dependent upon many factors including the volume of interest earning assets  the general level of interest rates  the dynamics of the change in interest rates  and levels of non performing loans 
the cost of funds varies with the amount of funds necessary to support interest earning assets  the rates paid to attract and hold deposits  rates paid on borrowed funds  and the levels of non interest bearing demand deposits and equity capital

net interest income as a percentage of net interest income and other income was   and for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively 
table illustrates that the decline in interest income in compared with was attributed to interest rates 
the average growth in interest earning assets of million in over was due to a million increase in loans and a million increase in the investment portfolio 
as shown in table  the tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets for declined to from in interest this decline was primarily due to lower reinvestment rates on loans and investments  and market forces impacting product pricing

increased levels of demand deposits and a general reduction in all rates paid for interest bearing deposits and borrowings were the primary reasons for the million decrease in interest expense 
the average funding costs declined to in compared with in  as increased levels of lower cost interest bearing demand deposits outpaced the declines in savings and time deposit balances 
as a result of the preceding comments  susquehanna s net interest margin  on a taxable equivalent basis  declined from in to in variances do occur in the net interest margin as an exact repricing of assets and liabilities is not possible 
a further explanation of the impact of asset and liability repricing is found in the market risks section of this discussion 
provision and allowance for loan and lease losses susquehanna s provision for loan and lease losses is based upon management s quarterly loan portfolio review 
the purpose of the review is to assess loan quality  identify impaired loans  analyze delinquencies  ascertain loan growth  evaluate potential charge offs and recoveries  and assess general economic conditions in the markets its affiliates serve 
commercial and real estate loans and leases are rated by loan officers and  periodically  by loan review personnel 
consumer and residential real estate loans are generally reviewed in the aggregate as they are of relative small dollar size and homogeneous in nature 
in addition to economic conditions  loan portfolio diversification  delinquency  and historic loss experience  consideration is also given to examinations performed by the regulatory authorities 
to determine the allowance and corresponding provision  the amount required for specific allocation is first determined 
for all types of commercial loans and leases and construction loans  this amount is based upon specific borrower data determined by reviewing individual non performing  delinquent  or potentially troubled credits 
in addition  a general allocation is also determined using the same criteria applied to the total commercial portfolio 
consumer and residential real estate allowances  which may include specific allocations  generally are based upon recent charge off and delinquency history  other known trends  and expected losses over the remaining lives of these loans  as well as the condition of local  regional  and national economies 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is the amount which  when added to these allocated amounts  brings the total to the amount deemed adequate by management at that time 
this unallocated portion is available to absorb losses sustained anywhere within the loan portfolio 
table presents this allocation 
the loan and lease portfolio represents loans and leases made primarily within susquehanna s market area which includes central and southeastern pennsylvania  maryland  southern new jersey  and to a lesser extent  southwestern pennsylvania  delaware  west virginia  northern virginia  and the southern tier of new york state 
determining the level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective  and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan portfolio is a continuing event in light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate at december  as illustrated in table  the provision for loan and lease losses was million for compared to million in this increase was due to a growing loan portfolio and increased charge offs 
net charge offs  as seen in table  were million in compared with million in as a result  the allowance for loan and lease losses at december   was of period end loans and leases  or million compared with or million at december  the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of non performing loans decreased from at december  to at december  should the economic climate no longer continue to improve or begin to deteriorate  borrowers may experience difficulty  and the level of non performing loans and assets  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision 
in addition  regulatory authorities  as an integral part of their examinations  periodically review the allowance for possible loan and lease losses 
they may require additions to allowances based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of examination 
it is the policy of susquehanna not to renegotiate the terms of a loan simply because of a delinquency status 
rather  a loan is transferred to non accrual status if it is not well secured and in the process of collection  and is delinquent in payment of either principal or interest beyond days 
interest income received on non performing loans in and was million and million  respectively 
interest income which would have been recorded on these loans under the original terms was million and million for and  respectively 
at december   susquehanna had no outstanding commitments to advance additional funds with respect to these non performing loans 
table is an analysis of the provision levels as well as the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the past five years 
table reflects the five year history of non performing assets and loans contractually past due days and still accruing 
total non performing assets at december  and  of and million  respectively  includes million in other real estate acquired through foreclosure 
non performing assets as a percentage of period end loans and other real estate owned was at december   unchanged from decem ber  real estate acquired through foreclosure is carried at the lower of the recorded amount of the loan for which the foreclosed property served as collateral or the fair market value of the property as determined by a current appraisal less estimated costs to sell fair value

subsequent to foreclosure  gains or losses on the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure are recorded in operating income and any losses determined as a result of periodic valuations are charged to other operating expense 
loans with principal and or interest delinquent days or more which are still accruing interest were million at december   down from the million at december  although the economy is stable  softness in certain areas of the economy may adversely affect certain borrowers and may cause additional loans to become past due beyond days or be placed on nonaccrual status because of uncertainty of receiving full payment of either principal or interest on these loans 
potential problem loans consist of loans which are performing but for which potential credit problems have caused susquehanna to place them on its internally monitored loan list 
at december   such loans  not included in table  amounted to million 
depending upon the state of the economy and the impact thereon to these borrowers  as well as future events such as regulatory examination assessment  these loans and others not currently so identified could be classified as non performing assets in the future 
other income non interest income  recorded as other income  consists of service charges on deposit accounts  commissions  fees received for credit cards  travelers check sales  and money orders  fees for trust services  income generated from bank owned life insurance and reinsurance activities  gains and losses on security transactions  net gains on sales of mortgages  net gains on sales of other real estate owned  and other miscellaneous income  such as safe deposit box rents and gains on the sale of branch offices 
other income as a percentage of net interest income and other income was   and for   and  respectively 
non interest income increased million or  in over service charges on deposit accounts were up million or 
gain on sale of mortgage loans decreased million  as loans originated for sale were million less than during the third quarter of  susquehanna sold two of its branch locations in elkton  md  and a pre tax gain of million was realized as a result of that sale 
merchant credit card fees increased million over as susquehanna s merchant program expanded over the prior year 
income on bank owned life insurance increased million in over  as susquehanna purchased an additional million of insurance in the second quarter of gains on the sale of investment securities were million higher in compared with other expenses non interest expenses are categorized into six main groupings employee related expenses  which include salaries  table analysis of other expenses dollars in thousands year ended december advertising  marketing  and public relations    audits and examinations communications    directors fees    legal and professional    life insurance company related expenses other real estate   outside services    pa shares capital stock tax    postage and delivery    stationery and supplies    fdic insurance credit card assessments  all other    total    fringe benefits  and employment taxes  occupancy expenses  which include depreciation  rents  maintenance  utilities  and insurance  equipment expenses  which include depreciation  rents  and maintenance  amortization of intangible assets  restructuring charges  and other expenses detailed in table incurred in operating susquehanna s business 
non interest expense increased million  or  in over  primarily due to a special million pre tax restructure charge relating to the consolidation of back office operations 
salaries and employee benefits  excluding bonuses  increased million  or  from to susque hanna s annual bonus program  based upon certain financial benchmarks  earned zero in and million in however  due to extraordinary efforts by employees during related to mergers  systems conversions and year computer preparations  susquehanna s board of directors approved a special bonus for all susquehanna employees excluding executive and senior management 
this bonus  including related benefits  totals million 
charges for occupancy and equipment remained stable with only a slight increase in over amortization of intangible assets declined million in from as certain intangibles have reached the end of their amortization period 
the million restructuring charge represents severance  employee and employment assistance services  consulting  and asset write offs related to a reduction in the work force 
this reduction in the work force should result in an annual  estimated net savings of million of which approximately will be realized in and realized in years after all other expenses increased million  see table  with increases in credit card assessments of million  amortization of capitalized data processing systems conversion costs of million  and data processing and related communications charges of million 
income taxes susquehanna s effective tax rate for was compared to in the effective rate for was reduced because of increased levels of tax advantaged income 
since  susquehanna purchased million of insurance related products and recognized million and million in and  respectively  of tax advantaged income from the increase in cash surrender values and insurance proceeds 
as tax advantaged loans and securities continue to mature  and the opportunities for investment in additional tax advantaged enterprises become less attractive due to certain provisions of the tax reform act of  effective tax rates may increase in the years ahead 
susquehanna recognizes deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences the difference between financial and tax bases  and deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences 
management believes the deferred tax assets recognized at december   will be realized in future tax returns 
while the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income  taxable income in prior carry back years and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences are sufficient to offset the future reversals of deductible temporary differences without implementing any tax strategies or assuming future taxable income 
financial condition investment securities susquehanna follows sfas accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
this accounting pronouncement requires the segregation of investment securities into three categories  each having a distinct accounting treatment 
securities identified as held to maturity continue to be carried at their amortized cost  and  except for limited circumstances  may not be sold prior to maturity 
securities identified as available for sale must be reported at their market or fair value and the difference between that value and their amortized cost recorded in the equity section  net of taxes 
as a result  total equity of susquehanna was negatively impacted by million as the unrealized gains or losses for available for sale securities net of taxes  changed from a positive million at december   to a negative million at december  securities identified as trading account securities are marked to market with the change recorded in the income statement 
presently  susquehanna does not engage in trading activity  but does engage in active portfolio management which requires the majority of its security portfolio to be identified as available for sale 
while sfas requires segregation into held to maturity and available for sale categories see table  it does not change susquehanna s policy concerning the purchase of only high quality securities 
strategies employed address liquidity  capital adequacy  and net interest margin considerations which then determine the assignment of purchases into these two categories 
table illustrates the maturities of these security portfolios and the weighted average yields based upon amortized costs 
yields are shown on a tax equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate 
at december   susquehanna held no securities of one issuer  other than us government obligations  where the aggregate book value exceeded ten percent of stockholders equity 
loans table presents the loans outstanding  by type of loan  for the past five years 
loan growth for was  or million  over loan growth in was realized in all major loan types  except construction loans 
consumer loans increased million  leases increased million  mortgages increased million  and commercial loans grew by million 
as noted in table  susquehanna s loan portfolio contains no significant concentrations other than geographic locations and housing developments 
susquehanna s banking subsidiaries have historically reported a significant amount of loans secured by real estate  as depicted in table many of these loans have real estate collateral taken as additional security not related to the acquisition of the real estate pledged

these loans with maturities after consist of million with fixed rate pricing and million with variable rate pricing 
deposits susquehanna s deposit base is consumer oriented  consisting of time deposits  primarily certificates of deposit of various terms  interest bearing demand accounts  savings accounts  and demand deposits 
the average amounts of deposits by type are summarized in table susquehanna does not rely upon time deposits of  or more as a principal source of funds as they represent only of total deposits

due to the nature of its operations  only interest rate risk and liquidity risk are significant to susquehanna 
liquidity and interest rate risk are related but distinctly different from one another 
the maintenance of adequate liquidity the ability to meet the cash requirements of its customers and other financial commitments is a fundamental aspect of susquehanna s asset liability management strategy 
susquehanna s policy of diversifying its funding sources purchased funds  repurchase agreements  and deposit accounts allows it to avoid undue concentration in any single financial market and also to avoid heavy funding requirements within short periods of time 
at december   susquehanna s subsidiary banks and savings bank have an unused line of credit available to them from the federal home loan bank for more than million 
however  liquidity is not entirely dependent on increasing susquehanna s liability balances 
liquidity can also be generated from maturing or readily marketable assets 
the carrying value of investment securities maturing within one year amounted to million at december  percentage percentage percentage of loans to of loans to of loans to amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans table loan concentrations substantially all of susquehanna s loans and leases are to enterprises and individuals in pennsylvania  new jersey  and maryland

cash and due from banks amounted to million and short term investments amounted to million  which represent additional sources of liquidity 
closely related to the management of liquidity is the management of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk focuses on maintaining stability in the net interest margin  an important factor in earnings growth 
interest rate sensitivity is the matching or mismatching of the maturity and rate structure of the interest bearing assets and liabilities 
it is the objective of management to control the difference in the timing of the rate changes for these assets and liabilities to preserve a satisfactory net interest margin 
in doing so  susquehanna endeavors to maximize earnings in an environment of changing interest rates 
however  there is a lag in maintaining the desired matching because the repricing of products does occur at varying time intervals 
susquehanna employs a variety of methods to monitor interest rate risk 
by dividing the assets and liabilities into three groups fixed rate  floating rate  and those which reprice only at management s discretion strategies are developed which are designed to minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
management also utilizes gap analysis to evaluate rate sensitivity at a given point in time 
table illustrates susquehanna s estimated interest rate sensitivity and periodic and cumulative gap positions as calculated at december  and these estimates include anticipated paydowns on mortgage backed securities and certain assumptions regarding core deposits 
an institution with more assets repricing than liabilities over a given time frame is considered asset sensitive  and one with more liabilities repricing than assets is consid table average deposit balances dollars in thousands year ended december demand deposits    interest bearing demand deposits    savings deposits    time deposits    total    table deposit maturity maturity of time deposits of or more at december dollars in thousands three months or less  over three months through six months  over six months through twelve months  over twelve months  total  table balance sheet gap analysis dollars in thousands over at december  months months years years total assets short term investments   investments      loans and leases  net of unearned income      total      liabilities interest bearing demand      savings      time      time in denominations of or more      total borrowings     total      interest sensitivity gap periodic     cumulative    cumulative gap as a percentage of earning assets over at december  months months years years total assets short term investments   investments      loans and leases  net of unearned income      total      liabilities interest bearing demand      savings      time      time in denominations of or more     total borrowings      total      interest sensitivity gap periodic     cumulative    cumulative gap as a percentage of earning assets ered liability sensitive 
an asset sensitive institution will generally benefit from rising rates  and a liability sensitive institution will generally benefit from declining rates 
sus quehanna currently has a positive gap position asset sensitive at one year and  therefore  would be negatively affected by a decline in interest rates 
see table for the estimated net interest income effect of susquehanna s positive gap position 
in addition to periodic gap reports comparing the sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in interest rates  management also utilizes a quarterly report prepared for susquehanna by independent third party consultants based on information provided by susquehanna which measures susquehanna s exposure to interest rate risk 
the model calculates the income effect and the present value of assets  liabilities  and equity at current interest rates  and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates at one percent intervals 
the income effect and present value of each major category of financial instrument is calculated by the model using estimated cash flows based on prepayments  early withdrawals  and weighted average contractual rates and table balance sheet shock analysis base dollars in thousands present at december  value assets cash and due from banks      short term investments      investment securities held to maturity      available for sale      loans net of unearned income      other assets      total assets      liabilities deposits non interest bearing      interest bearing      total borrowings      other liabilities      total liabilities      total economic equity      total liabilities and equity      economic equity ratio value at risk     value at risk base present at december  value assets cash and due from banks      short term investments      investment securities held to maturity      available for sale      loans net of unearned income      other assets      total assets      liabilities deposits non interest bearing      interest bearing      total borrowings      other liabilities      total liabilities      total economic equity      total liabilities and equity      economic equity ratio value at risk    value at risk terms 
for present value calculations  the model also considers discount rates for similar financial instruments 
the resulting present value of longer term fixed rate financial instruments are more sensitive to change in a higher or lower market interest rate scenario  while adjustable rate financial instruments largely reflect only a change in present value representing the difference between the contractual and discounted rates until the next interest rate repricing date 
a substantial portion of susquehanna s loans and mortgage backed securities are residential mortgage loans containing significant imbedded options which permit the borrower to prepay the principal balance of the loan prior to maturity prepayments without penalty 
a loan s propensity for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  including  the current interest rate  the interest rate on the loan  the financial ability of the borrower to refinance  the economic benefit to be obtained from refinanc ing  availability of refinancing at attractive terms  as well as economic and other factors in specific geographic areas which affect the sales and price levels of residential property 
in a changing interest rate environment  prepayments may increase or decrease on fixed and adjustable rate loans depending on the current relative levels and expectations of future short and long term interest rates 
since a significant portion of susquehanna s loans are variable rate loans  prepayments on such loans generally increase when long term interest rates fall or are at historically low levels relative to short term interest rates  making fixed rate loans more desirable 
investment securities  other than those with early call provisions  generally do not have significant imbedded options and repay pursuant to specific terms until maturity 
while savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice  a continuing relationship with customers resulting in table net interest income shock analysis base dollars in thousands present at december  value interest income short term investments     investments      loans and leases      total interest income      interest expense interest bearing demand and savings      time      total borrowings      total interest expense      net interest income      net interest income at risk     net interest income at risk base present at december  value interest income short term investments      investments      loans and leases      total interest income      interest expense interest bearing demand and savings      time      total borrowings      total interest expense      net interest income      net interest income at risk     net interest income at risk future deposits and withdrawals is generally predictable  resulting in a dependable and uninterruptible source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  while term fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes have prepayment penalties which discourage customer withdrawal of time deposits and prepayment of fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes prior to maturity 
susquehanna s loans and mortgage backed securities are primarily indexed to the national interest indices 
when such loans and mortgage backed securities are funded by interest bearing liabilities which are determined by other indices  primarily deposits and fhlb borrowings  a changing interest rate environment may result in different levels of changes in the different indices  resulting in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  susquehanna s financial instruments 
each index is unique and is influenced by different external factors  therefore  the historical relationships in various indices may not be indicative of the actual change which may result in a changing interest rate environment 
tables and reflect the estimated income effect and present value of assets  liabilities  and equity calculated using certain assumptions determined by susquehanna as of december  and  at current interest rates and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates of one and two percent 
as noted in table  the economic equity at risk is only five percent at an interest rate change of minus two percent  while table discloses that net interest income at risk is seven percent at an interest rate change of minus two percent

assets and certain off balance sheet items are segmented into one of four broad risk categories and weighted according to the relative percentage of credit risk assigned by the regulatory authorities 
off balance sheet instruments are converted into a balance sheet credit equivalent before being assigned to one of the four risk weighted categories 
to supplement the risk based capital ratios  the regulators issued a minimum leverage ratio guideline tier capital as a percentage of average assets less excludable intangibles 
capital elements are segmented into two tiers 
tier capital represents shareholders equity reduced by excludable intangibles  while total capital represents tier capital plus certain allowable long term debt  the portion of the allowance for loan losses equal to of risk adjusted assets  and of the unrealized gain on equity securities 
the maintenance of a strong capital base at both the parent company level as well as at each bank affiliate is an important aspect of susquehanna s philosophy
