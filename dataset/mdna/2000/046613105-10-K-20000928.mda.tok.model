item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general prior to fiscal  the company pursued an active acquisition program designed to take advantage of consolidation opportunities in the widely fragmented foundry industry 
the company has acquired nineteen foundries since its inception 
as a result of these completed transactions as well as internal growth  the company s net sales have increased from approximately million for its first full fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the company did not make any acquisitions in fiscal and is not currently contemplating any major acquisitions in fiscal the company s primary focus in fiscal will be on the integration and improvement of existing operations 
due to the large size of certain orders  the timing for deliveries of orders and the number and types of castings produced  the company s net sales and net income may fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter 
generally  the first fiscal quarter is seasonally weaker than the other quarters as a result of plant shutdowns for maintenance at most of the company s foundries as well as at many customers plants 
see supplemental quarterly information 
results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales for fiscal were million  representing a decrease of million  or  from net sales of million in fiscal the operations acquired by the company since september  generated net sales of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as follows date acquired fy fy operation net sales net sales in millions in millions london precision autun excluding net sales attributable to the operations acquired since september   net sales for fiscal were million  representing a decrease of million  or  from net sales of million in fiscal this decrease in net sales was due primarily to decreases in net sales to the offshore oil and gas  steel  mining and power generation markets  partially offset by increases in net sales to the rail and military markets 
net sales of sheffield forgemasters group limited sheffield for fiscal decreased million from net sales in fiscal in addition to the weak market conditions  net sales have also been impacted by the bankruptcy and subsequent cessation of operations of a major customer at the company s primecast  inc primecast subsidiary 
through fiscal  primecast has aggressively worked at replacing the volume lost from beloit corporation  which filed for bankruptcy in june during february  beloit was sold at auction  in parts  and as a result  the plants to which primecast supplied castings subsequently ceased operations 
for fiscal  primecast s net sales were million compared to net sales of million in fiscal included in this million decrease was a million decrease in net sales to beloit corporation 
gross profit for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower net sales and reduced absorption of overhead at the company s subsidiaries which primarily serve the mining  offshore oil and gas  power generation and steel markets 
the largest impact of these weak market conditions was at sheffield  where its gross profit for fiscal decreased by million to million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the bankruptcy of a major customer at primecast and  with a lesser impact  the loss of a major customer at claremont foundry  inc claremont have also had a negative effect on gross profit 
lower sales volume  coupled with the costs of developing new customers and training employees on new work has resulted in lower gross profits at these operations 
primecast s gross profit for fiscal decreased by million to a gross loss of  compared to a gross profit of million for fiscal claremont s gross profit in fiscal was a loss of million on net sales of million  compared to a loss of million on net sales of million in fiscal the company is in the process of closing claremont  and transferring much of the work to other company operations 
during fiscal  the company s reserve for warranty expense decreased to million at june  from million at june  warranty expense recorded by the company in fiscal was a credit to income of  compared to a credit to income of million in fiscal the decrease in the warranty reserve during fiscal primarily related to the company s sheffield subsidiary located in the united kingdom 
the company maintains reserves for warranty charges based on specific claims made by customers  for which management estimates a final settlement of the claim  and for expected claims not yet received 
the estimate for claims not yet received is based on historical results and is estimated monthly 
during fiscal  the company s warranty reserve requirement and related expense declined primarily due to the resolution of specific warranty claims with three different customers whose products were replaced or determined by the customer to be satisfactory 
during fiscal  the company s reserve for workers compensation and employee health care increased to million at june  from million at june  workers compensation and employee health care expense was million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  primarily reflecting higher health care costs 
the increase in the reserve for workers compensation and employee health care primarily reflects changes in the amount and timing of actual payments 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease in sg a was primarily attributable to the consolidation of four operating units into two at sheffield  partially offset by expenses associated with fonderie d autun autun  which was acquired on february  amortization of certain intangibles for fiscal was million or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the intangible assets consist of goodwill recorded in connection with certain of the company s acquisitions 
the company has also recorded a liability  consisting of the excess of acquired net assets over cost negative goodwill  in connection with the acquisitions of canadian steel foundries ltd 
canadian steel and autun 
the amortization of negative goodwill was a credit to income in fiscal of million  or of net sales  as compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal impairment charges for fiscal were million million  net of tax 
this million reflects a million million  net of tax charge relating to the company s planned closure of claremont and a million million  net of tax fixed asset impairment charge at primecast 
other income for fiscal primarily consisted of non recurring gains of million  net of tax on the termination of interest rate swap agreements 
other income for fiscal was million million  net of tax 
following the july missouri river flood  the company established a reserve to repair long term damage caused by the flood to the company s plant 
during fiscal  the company revised this estimate downward resulting in a non recurring gain of million million  net of tax 
partially offsetting this gain was a charge of   net of tax related to an industrial accident at jahn foundry corp 
jahn foundry see liquidity and capital resources 
during  the board of directors committed to a plan for the closure of claremont due to continued operating losses 
the company recorded a charge of million primarily to reduce the carrying value of the claremont fixed assets to estimated fair value 
the company intends to transfer as much work as possible to other acc foundries by november  and close the plant 
the company will terminate approximately employees and will recognize a charge for severance benefits of approximately  in the quarter ended september  on july   a newly formed subsidiary of the company  primecast  acquired the foundry division of beloit corporation beloit for million 
simultaneous with the purchase  primecast entered a five year supply agreement to supply castings to beloit 
as a captive supplier  historically over of this operation s sales had been to beloit 
in june  beloit declared bankruptcy  in combination with the bankruptcy of its parent  harnischfeger industries 
beloit continued to operate in bankruptcy  and the court granted beloit s request to re instate the five year casting supply agreement 
in february  beloit was sold at auction  in parts 
expectations were that the new owners would continue to operate the former beloit business which primecast primarily served 
this business consisted primarily of paper mill equipment and was located in beloit  wisconsin 
however  ultimately these parts of the former beloit were closed  resulting in the elimination of this work for primecast  and the termination of the five year supply agreement 
these events have caused primecast to operate at a substantial loss  due to much lower production volume and a less profitable mix of work 
as a result  the carrying value of primecast s long lived assets have been determined to be impaired 
the company recorded an impairment charge of million million  net of tax relating to the fixed assets at primecast 
interest expense for fiscal increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in interest expense primarily reflects higher average interest rates on the company s outstanding indebtedness 
the company has recorded a million deferred income tax benefit in fiscal with respect to the reinvestment of certain flood insurance proceeds received in and the company recorded pretax gains of approximately million in and related to insurance proceeds resulting from flood damage to the company s atchison  kansas foundry in july for federal income tax purposes  the company treated the flood as an involuntary conversion event under the internal revenue code code and related treasury regulations 
the code provides generally that if certain conditions are met  gains on insurance proceeds from an involuntary conversion are not taxable if the proceeds are reinvested in qualified replacement property within two years after the close of the first taxable year in which any part of the conversion gain is realized 
the company believed that its treatment of certain foundry subsidiary stock acquisitions as qualified replacement property was subject to potential challenge by the internal revenue service service in the first year in which involuntary conversion gain was realized for federal income tax purposes 
the company recorded income tax expense on the insurance gains in pending review of its position by the service or the expiration of the statute of limitations under the code for the service to assess income taxes with respect to the company s position 
the company s treatment of certain foundry subsidiary stock acquisitions as qualified replacement property creates differing basis in the foundry subsidiary stock for financial statement and tax purposes 
these differences have not been recognized as taxable temporary differences under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  since the subsidiary basis differences can be permanently deferred through subsidiary mergers or tax free liquidations 
on march   the statute of limitations for the service to assess taxes with respect to the company s position expired 
the deferred taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements in prior years were no longer required 
excluding this million deferred income tax benefit  the income tax benefit for fiscal reflected an effective rate of approximately  which is lower than the combined federal  state and provincial statutory rate because of the provision for tax benefits at lower effective rates on losses at certain subsidiaries 
income tax expense for fiscal reflected an effective rate of approximately 
the company s combined effective tax rate reflects the different federal  state and provincial statutory rates of the various jurisdictions in which the company operates  and the proportion of taxable income earned in each of those tax jurisdictions 
as a result of the foregoing  net income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales for fiscal were million  representing an increase of million  or  over net sales of million in fiscal the operations acquired by the company since october  generated net sales of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as follows date acquired fy fy operation net sales net sales in millions in millions inverness sheffield claremont london precision autun excluding net sales attributable to the operations acquired since october   net sales for fiscal were million  representing a decrease of million  or  over net sales of million in fiscal this decrease in net sales was due primarily to decreases in net sales to the offshore oil and gas  steel  mining  power generation  agriculture and petrochemical markets  partially offset by an increase in net sales to the rail market 
gross profit for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased sales volume levels resulting from the acquisitions of sheffield and london precision machine and tool ltd 
london precision 
the contribution from london precision and improved results at amite foundry and machine  inc amite due to increased sales volume levels  improved productivity and reduced employee turnover and training positively impacted gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
offsetting these factors were i decreased absorption of overhead resulting from lower net sales to the offshore oil and gas  mining  steel  power generation  petrochemical and agricultural markets  ii delays in the scheduled delivery of orders by customers in the mining  construction and rail markets  iii continued productivity and scrap problems at inverness castings group  inc inverness and claremont  iv increased warranty costs at canada alloy castings  ltd 
canada alloy and v increased training costs  higher employee turnover and increased overtime due to the generally tight labor markets 
in addition  gross profit as a percentage of net sales was impacted by i reduced productivity and excessive overtime due to power curtailments under the company s interruptible electricity contracts resulting from the extreme heat during the first quarter and ii higher plant maintenance shutdown costs at atchison st

during fiscal  the company s reserve for warranty expense decreased to million at june  from million at june  warranty expense recorded by the company was a credit to income of million in fiscal compared to expense of  in fiscal the decrease in both the warranty reserve and warranty expense during fiscal primarily related to the company s sheffield subsidiary located in the united kingdom 
the company maintains reserves for warranty charges based on specific claims made by customers  for which management estimates a final settlement of the claim  and for expected claims not yet received 
the estimate for claims not yet received is based on historical results and is estimated monthly 
during fiscal  the company s estimated reserve requirement and related expense declined primarily due to an overall improvement in sheffield s claim experience over the prior year and a decline in sales volume resulting in a reduced estimate of claims not yet received 
sheffield s customer claims experience as a percentage of sales declined from in fiscal to in fiscal sheffield s net sales for fiscal were million  representing a decrease of million  or  from net sales of million for the twelve months ended june  in addition  two specific customer claims included in the reserve at june  were withdrawn by the customer in fiscal  as the products were determined to be satisfactory 
this resulted in an adjustment to the reserve  and a reduction in warranty expense  of approximately  during fiscal  the company s reserve for workers compensation and employee health care decreased to million at june  from million at june  workers compensation and employee health care expense was million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  of which million of the increase was associated with operations acquired by the company since october the decrease in the reserve for workers compensation and employee health care primarily reflects changes in the amount and timing of actual payments 
sg a for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in sg a was primarily attributable to expenses associated with the operations acquired by the company in fiscal and fiscal the increase in sg a as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher average sg a as a percentage of net sales at sheffield 
other income for fiscal was million million  net of tax 
following the july missouri river flood  insurance proceeds related to property damage were reserved for estimated future repairs to the plant 
during the fourth quarter  the company revised this estimate downward resulting in a non recurring gain of million million  net of tax 
partially offsetting this gain was a charge of   net of tax related to an industrial accident at the company s subsidiary  jahn foundry see liquidity and capital resources 
amortization of certain intangibles for fiscal was million or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the intangible assets consist of goodwill recorded in connection with certain of the company s acquisitions 
the company has also recorded a liability  consisting of the excess of acquired net assets over cost negative goodwill  in connection with the acquisitions of canadian steel and autun 
the amortization of negative goodwill was a credit to income in fiscal of  or of net sales  as compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal interest expense for fiscal increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in interest expense primarily reflects an increase in the average amount of outstanding indebtedness during fiscal primarily incurred to finance the company s acquisitions 
income tax expense for fiscal and fiscal reflected the combined federal  state and provincial statutory rate of approximately and  respectively  which is higher than the combined federal  state and provincial statutory rate because of the provision for the tax benefits at lower effective rates on losses at certain subsidiaries 
the company s combined effective tax rate reflects the different federal  state and provincial statutory rates of the various jurisdictions in which the company operates  and the proportion of taxable income earned in each of those tax jurisdictions 
as a result of the foregoing  net income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed operations with internally generated funds  proceeds from the sale of senior notes and available borrowings under its bank credit facilities 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  an increase of million from fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to advances by the company s insurance carrier against the claim relating to the industrial accident at jahn foundry 
see below working capital was million at june   as compared to million at june  the decrease in working capital primarily reflects the classification of the company s bank credit facility and senior notes with an insurance company as current at june  as described below  the company obtained a waiver of compliance with certain financial covenants through september  from its bank lenders and an insurance company holding the company s senior notes 
absent another waiver  the company does not believe it will be in compliance with such covenants 
the agreements with the company s bank lenders and the insurance company contain cross acceleration default provisions which would allow the debt to be accelerated 
accordingly  the outstanding balances under these agreements have been classified as current at june  during fiscal  the company made capital expenditures of million  as compared to million for fiscal included in fiscal were capital expenditures of million to rebuild the shell molding area and boiler room damaged in the industrial accident on february  at jahn foundry see below and million to expand autun s product line capabilities in the manufacture of gray and ductile iron castings 
included in fiscal were capital expenditures of million on upgrading the  ton forging press to  tons at sheffield 
the balance of capital expenditures in both periods were used for routine projects at each of the company s facilities 
the company expects to make approximately million of capital expenditures during fiscal on october   the company and its lenders entered into the first amendment to the amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement 
the credit agreement consists of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility

absent the waiver  the company would not have been in compliance with the cash flow leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants 
compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement and note purchase agreement is determined on a rolling four quarter basis 
the results for fiscal are  and expected results for fiscal will likely continue to be  below results needed to achieve compliance with these covenants under the credit agreement and note purchase agreement 
accordingly  the company is currently a negotiating forbearance agreements to its credit agreement and note purchase agreement in which the parties would agree not to enforce their rights with respect to defaults in connection with i covenants relating to the cash flow leverage ratios  fixed charge coverage ratio and current ratio  and ii extensions of additional credit due to noncompliance of the covenants described above and other provisions  and b negotiating with other financial institutions to establish a new credit facility with covenants that the company believes it will be able to satisfy 
during the past several years  the company has been able to negotiate operating flexibility with its lenders  although future success in achieving any such renegotiations or refinancings  or the specific terms thereof  including interest rates  capital expenditure limits or borrowing capacity  cannot be assured 
the company believes that its operating cash flow and amounts available for borrowing under the new credit facility  when established  or its existing credit facility  assuming forbearances are obtained  will be adequate to fund its capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the next months 
however  the level of capital expenditure and working capital requirements may be greater than currently anticipated as a result of unforeseen expenditures such as compliance with environmental laws or the accident at jahn foundry 
if the company fails to achieve compliance with the terms of its credit agreement or  in the absence of such compliance  if the company fails to amend such financial covenants on terms favorable to the company  the company may be in default under such covenants 
if such default occurred  it would permit acceleration of its debt under its credit agreement which  in turn  would permit acceleration of the notes under the note purchase agreement  and vice versa 
total indebtedness of the company at june  was million  as compared to million at june  this increase of million primarily reflects indebtedness incurred of million to purchase common stock in certain of the company s subsidiaries 
at june   million was available for borrowing under the company s revolving credit facility 
an accident  involving an explosion and fire  occurred on february   at jahn foundry  located in springfield  massachusetts 
nine employees were seriously injured and there have been three fatalities 
the damage was confined to the shell molding area and boiler room 
the other areas of the foundry are operational 
molds are currently being produced at other foundries as well as jahn foundry while the repairs are made 
the new shell molding department is scheduled to be in operation this fall 
the company carries insurance for property and casualty damages over million of coverage  business interruption approximately million of coverage  general liability million of coverage and workers compensation up to full statutory liability for itself and its subsidiaries 
the company recorded charges of   before tax during the third quarter of fiscal  primarily reflecting the deductibles under the company s various insurance policies 
at this time there can be no assurance that the company s ultimate costs and expenses resulting from the accident will not exceed available insurance coverage by an amount which could be material to its financial condition or results of operations and cash flows 
a civil action has been commenced in massachusetts state court on behalf of the estates of deceased workers  their families  injured workers and their families  against the supplier of a chemical compound used in jahn foundry s manufacturing process 
counsel for the plaintiffs informally have indicated a desire to explore whether any facts would support adding the company to that litigation as a jointly and severally liable defendant 
the supplier of the chemical compound  borden chemical  inc  filed a third party complaint against jahn foundry in massachusetts state court on february  seeking indemnity for any liability it has to the plaintiffs in the civil action 
the company s comprehensive general liability insurance carrier has retained counsel on behalf of jahn foundry and the company and is aggressively defending jahn foundry in the third party complaint  as well as monitoring the situation on behalf of the company 
it is too early to assess the potential liability to jahn foundry for the third party complaint and the potential liability to the company for any claim  which in any event the company would aggressively defend 
plaintiff s counsel has informally raised the possibility of seeking to make a double recovery under the workers compensation policy in force for jahn foundry  contending that there was willful misconduct on jahn foundry s part leading to the accident 
such recovery  if pursued and made  would be of a material nature 
it is too early to assess the potential liability for such a claim  which in any event jahn foundry would aggressively defend 
the company  its property insurance carrier and its insurance broker dispute the amount of property insurance available for property damages suffered in this accident 
it is too early in the process of calculating the loss to estimate the amount in dispute 
management believes that the probability of any loss resulting from the disputed property insurance coverage is remote 
the company currently believes this dispute will be resolved during fiscal if this dispute cannot be resolved amicably  the company would vigorously pursue its remedies against both parties 
following the accident  osha conducted an investigation of the accident 
on august   osha issued a citation describing violations of the occupational safety and health act of  which primarily related to housekeeping  maintenance and other specific  miscellaneous items 
neither of the two violations specifically addressing conditions related to the explosion and fire were classified as serious or willful 
without admitting any wrongdoing  jahn foundry entered into a settlement with osha that addresses the alleged work place safety issues and agreed to pay  in fines 
market risk the company operates manufacturing facilities in the us  canada and europe and utilizes fixed and floating rate debt to finance its global operations 
as a result  the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations  and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes the political and economic risks related to its foreign operations are mitigated due to the stability of the countries in which its largest foreign operations are located 
in the normal course of business  the company uses derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its market risks  although  at june   the company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
additional information regarding the company s financial instruments is contained in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flow associated with such changes 
the company s principal currency exposures are in the major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
for and  the company s exposure to market risk has been estimated using sensitivity analysis  which is defined as the change in the fair value of a derivative or financial instrument assuming a hypothetical adverse change in market rates or prices 
the company used current market rates on its debt and derivative portfolio to perform the sensitivity analysis 
certain items such as lease contracts  insurance contracts  and obligations for pension and other post retirement benefits were not included in the analysis 
the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 
actual changes in interest rates or market prices may differ from the hypothetical changes 
the company s primary interest rate exposures relate to its cash and short term investments and fixed and variable rate debt 
the potential loss in fair values is based on an immediate change in the net present values of the company s interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a change in interest rates 
the potential loss in cash flows and earnings is based on the change in the net interest income expense over a one year period due to an immediate change in rates 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would have a material impact on the company s earnings of approximately  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in currency rates against the british pound sterling and canadian dollar result from the company s holdings in cash and short term investments and its utilization of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge customer receivables and firm commitments 
the potential loss in fair values is based on an immediate change in the us dollar equivalent balances of the company s currency exposures due to a shift in exchange rates versus the british pound sterling and canadian dollar 
the potential loss in cash flows and earnings is based on the change in cash flow and earnings over a one year period resulting from an immediate change in currency exchange rates versus the british pound sterling and canadian dollar 
based on the company s holdings of financial instruments at june  and  a hypothetical depreciation in the pound sterling and the canadian dollar versus all other currencies would have a material impact on the company s earnings of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the company s analysis does not include the offsetting impact from its underlying hedged exposures customer receivables and firm commitments 
if the company included these underlying hedged exposures in its sensitivity analysis  these exposures would substantially offset the financial impact of its foreign currency forward exchange contracts due to changes in currency rates 
inflation management believes that the company s operations have not been materially adversely affected by inflation or changing prices 
forward looking statements statements above in the subsections entitled general  liquidity and capital resources and market risk  such as expects  intends  contemplating and statements regarding quarterly fluctuations  statements regarding the adequacy of funding for capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the next twelve months and similar expressions that are not historical are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements include the company s expectations as to future performance 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements are the following the size and timing of future acquisitions  business conditions and the state of the general economy  particularly the capital goods industry  the strength of the us dollar  british pound sterling and the euro  interest rates  the availability of labor  the successful conclusion of contract negotiations  the results of any litigation arising out of the accident at jahn foundry  the competitive environment in the casting industry and changes in laws and regulations that govern the company s business  particularly environmental regulations 
new accounting standards for a discussion of new accounting standards  see note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
supplemental quarterly information the company s business is characterized by large unit and dollar volume customer orders 
as a result  the company has experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in its net sales and net income from quarter to quarter 
generally  the first fiscal quarter is seasonally weaker than the other quarters as a result of plant shutdowns for maintenance at most of the company s foundries as well as at many customers plants 
in addition  the company s operating results may be adversely affected in fiscal quarters immediately following the consummation of an acquisition while the operations of the acquired business are integrated into the operations of the company
