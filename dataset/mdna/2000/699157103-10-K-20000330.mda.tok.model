item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
for a description of limitations inherent in forward looking statements  see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements on page ii 
basis of presentation we account for our interest in first permian using the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method of accounting  we record our investment in first permian at cost on the balance sheet 
this is increased or reduced by our proportionate share of first permian s income or loss  which is presented as one amount in the statements of operations 
our share of first permian s oil and gas reserves is presented separately under our oil and gas reserve information in note to the financial statements 
from june  until december   we owned a interest in the assets  liabilities and operating results of first permian 
on december   our interest in first permian increased to and since that date we have owned an equivalent interest in the assets  liabilities  operating results and oil and gas reserves of first permian 
our results for the year ended december  do not include our pro rata interest in the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses of first permian 
instead  our interest is reported in a line item on the income statement entitled equity in earnings of first permian 
our pro rata share of oil and gas reserves is presented in a separate table 
general our business strategy is to increase oil and gas reserves  production  cash flow and earnings by 
using d seismic and other advanced technologies to conduct our exploratory and development activities  
investing in high potential exploration prospects  
acquiring properties that we believe add incremental value  
exploiting our existing producing properties  
emphasizing cost controls  and 
positioning for opportunity 
since  our primary focus has been exploratory drilling using d seismic technology 
our long term business strategy is to increase our reserve base by using this and other advanced technologies 
additionally  we intend to exploit our existing properties and to acquire properties we believe can be exploited by developing reserves not previously produced 
we undertake projects only when we believe the project has the potential for initial cash flow adequate to return the project s capital expenditures within a short period of time  generally less than months 
we also endeavor to maximize the present value of our projects by accelerating production of our reserves consistent with prudent reservoir management and prevailing energy prices 
following this strategy  we have discovered oil and gas reserves using d seismic technology in the horseshoe atoll reef trend of west texas and the yegua frio wilcox gas trend onshore the gulf coast of texas 
additionally  we have acquired producing oil and gas properties in the permian basin of west texas 
capital used to acquire these properties has been provided primarily by secured bank financing  sales of our equity securities and cash flows from operations 
operating performance 
our operating performance is influenced by several factors  the most significant of which are the prices we receive for our oil and gas and our production volumes 
the world price for oil has overall influence on the prices that we receive for our oil production 
the prices received for different grades of oil are based upon the world price for oil  which is then adjusted based upon the particular grade 
typically  light oil is sold at a premium  while heavy grades of crude are discounted 
gas prices we receive are influenced by 
seasonal demand  
weather  
hurricane conditions in the gulf of mexico  
availability of pipeline transportation to end users  
proximity of our wells to major transportation pipeline infrastructures  and 
to a lesser extent  world oil prices 
additional factors influencing our overall operating performance include 
production expenses  
overhead requirements  and 
costs of capital 
our oil and gas exploration  development and acquisition activities require substantial and continuing capital expenditures 
historically  the sources of financing to fund our capital expenditures have included cash flow from operations  
sales of our equity securities  and 
bank borrowings 
because of the sustained deterioration in prices we received for the oil and gas we produced in and the first part of  the capital normally available to us from our cash flow and bank borrowings has been significantly reduced 
the protracted period of low oil and gas prices and a decrease in our drilling activity  which has adversely affected our ability to add new oil and gas reserves  has resulted in a reduction in our available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
for more information regarding our borrowing arrangements  see capital resources and liquidity beginning on page our oil and gas producing activities are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting method  we capitalize all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of oil and gas properties and with the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
see note to the financial statements 
these costs include lease acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenditures  cost of drilling both productive and non productive wells and overhead expenses directly related to land acquisition and exploration and development activities 
proceeds from the dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction in capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized unless such disposition involves a material change in reserves  in which case the gain or loss is recognized 
certain directly identifiable internal costs of property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
in  internal costs capitalized totaled  compared with  in and  in depletion of capitalized costs is calculated using the unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and gas reserves 
oil and gas production is converted to a common unit of measurement based upon relative energy content of each commodity 
costs from unproved properties are excluded from depletion until evaluated 
under the full cost method of accounting  net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  or the full cost ceiling limitation  are not to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  and lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  net of tax considerations 
depletion per equivalent unit of production ebo was in versus in and in the increase per ebo was a result of a combination of factors including 
a decline in parallel s reserve base during due to decreased drilling activity  which affected our ability to add new reserves  
an increase in parallel s net depletable basis  as a result of an impairment charge to the full cost pool related to unproved properties  and 
the effect of unsuccessful drilling efforts  which increase the cost pool but add no units of production 
results of operations our business activities are characterized by frequent  and sometimes significant  changes in our 
reserve base  
sources of production  
product mix oil versus gas volumes  and 
the prices we receive for our oil and gas production

years ended december  and december  oil and gas revenues 
our total oil and gas revenues for were  a decrease of  or less than  from  for the decrease in revenues for  compared to  is related to a decline in production volumes  which was partially offset by higher oil and gas prices 
production 
on an equivalent barrel basis  production totaled  ebo compared with  ebo in the decrease in production was primarily due to normal production declines associated with producing wells and decreased drilling activity in  which affected our ability to replace oil and gas produced during the year 
production costs 
the decrease in production costs in  compared with  was primarily the result of a decrease in production volumes 
production costs decreased  or  to  for the twelve months ended december   from  for the same period of production costs as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily because of higher oil and gas prices 
average production costs per ebo increased to for the twelve months ended december  compared to in the same period of  primarily because of lower production volumes and the fixed costs associated with producing wells 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to a decrease in property insurance costs and legal expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  versus for the same period in this decrease is primarily a result of higher oil and gas prices and a decline in general and administrative expenses 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
dd a expenses for decreased  or to  versus  in this decrease was a result of lower production volumes 
dd a expense as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily because of lower production volumes 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a noncash impairment charge of  related to our oil and gas reserves and unproved properties 
the impairment of oil and gas assets was primarily the result of a decrease in our year end proved reserves 
we recognized an impairment charge in of  or  net of tax  related to our oil and gas reserves and unproved properties 
the impairment of oil and gas assets in was primarily the result of the effect of significantly lower oil and natural gas prices on both proved and unproved oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  each quarter we are required to perform a ceiling test calculation 
the full cost pool carrying values cannot exceed a company s future net revenues from its proved reserves  discounted at per annum using constant current product prices  and the lower of cost or market of unproved properties 
the ceiling test was computed using the net present value of reserves at december  based on prices of per bbl of oil and per mcf of natural gas 
the prices used to compute the ceiling test in were per bbl and per mcf 
net interest expense 
net interest expense increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of this increase was principally a result of an increase in average borrowings from our revolving line of credit facility 
income tax benefit expense 
for the year ended december   we did not recognize an income tax benefit or expense because we generated net tax losses during the year 
for the year ended december   we recognized a tax benefit of  at december  and  we reviewed our deferred tax assets and  in light of the current economic conditions in the oil and gas industry  the outlook for future commodity prices  and our expected operational results in future period we believe that some of our net operating losses may expire unused 
therefore  we established a valuation allowance against them of  and  for and  respectively
