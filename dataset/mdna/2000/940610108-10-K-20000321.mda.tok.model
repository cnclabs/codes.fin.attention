financial condition securities securities are designated as either available for sale or held to maturity at the time of purchase 
securities available for sale may be sold in response to changes in market conditions  prepayment risk  rate fluctuations  liquidity  or capital requirements 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of tax  until realized 
securities designated as held to maturity are part of the corporation s portfolio of long term interest earning assets 
these securities are classified as long term because the corporation has the intent and ability to hold them until maturity 
securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
securities available for sale the amortized cost of securities available for sale at december  amounted to million  an increase of million over the amount 
this increase was due primarily to purchases of debt securities 
at december   the net unrealized gains on securities available for sale amounted to thousand  a decrease of million from the comparable amount 
this decrease was attributable to the effect of increases in interest rates that occurred throughout see note to the consolidated financial statements for detail of unrealized gains and losses associated with securities available for sale 
securities held to maturity the amortized cost of securities held to maturity increased million  to million at december  this increase is primarily attributable to purchases of mortgage backed securities 
the net unrealized losses on securities held to maturity amounted to million at december   compared to thousand in net unrealized gains at december  the decline was primarily due to the effects of increases in interest rates that occurred throughout federal home loan bank stock the corporation is required to maintain a level of investment in fhlb stock that currently is based on the level of its fhlb advances 
as of december  and  the corporation s investment in fhlb stock totaled million and million  respectively 
the gramm leach bliley act requires the fhlb to issue new capitalization requirements to be implemented by may loans total loans amounted to million at december   up million  or  from the december  amount of million 
the increase in total loans was led by growth in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios 
total commercial loans increased million  or  in  with the largest increase occurring in the commercial mortgage portfolio 
total residential real estate loans increased million  or  in during the third quarter of  the corporation sold its million portfolio of credit card loans at a gain  net of expenses and related income taxes  of thousand

excluding the effect of the sale  consumer loans were up million  or  in the corporation will continue to provide merchant credit card processing services 
other assets other assets totaled million at december   up million from million at december  the increase was primarily due to the purchase of boli during the second quarter of the corporation purchased million of boli as a financing tool for employee benefits 
the corporation expects to benefit from the boli contracts as a result of the tax free growth in cash surrender value and death benefits that are expected to be generated over time 
the purchase of the life insurance policy results in an interest sensitive asset on the corporation s consolidated balance sheet that provides monthly tax free income to the corporation 
the largest risk to the boli program is credit risk of the insurance carriers 
to mitigate this risk  annual financial condition reviews are completed on all carriers 
boli is included in other assets on the corporation s consolidated balance sheets at its cash surrender value 
increases in boli s cash surrender value are reported as other income in the corporation s consolidated statements of income

the increase in deposits is attributable to growth in all categories of deposits in demand deposits rose to million 
savings deposits increased million offsetting a decrease of million in retail certificates of deposit 
time deposits totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the million increase in time deposits was attributable to the addition of million in brokered certificates of deposit as well as growth in time deposits in denominations of thousand or more which increased by million in borrowings washington trust uses advances from the federal home loan bank of boston as well as other short term borrowings as part of its overall funding strategy 
the additional fhlb advances and short term borrowings were used to meet short term liquidity needs  to fund loan growth and to purchase securities

nonaccrual loans loans  with the exception of certain well secured residential mortgage loans  are placed on nonaccrual status and interest recognition is suspended when such loans are days or more past due with respect to principal and or interest 
well secured residential mortgage loans are permitted to remain on accrual status provided that full collection of principal and interest is assured 
loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when  in the opinion of management  full collection of principal and interest is doubtful 
interest previously accrued  but uncollected  is reversed against current period income 
subsequent cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are recognized as interest income  or recorded as a reduction of principal if full collection of the loan is doubtful or if impairment of the collateral is identified 
nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when the obligation has performed in accordance with the contract terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectibility of the contractual principal and interest is no longer doubtful 
included in accruing loans days or more past due at december  are residential mortgages amounting to thousand which are considered well collateralized and in the process of collection and therefore are deemed to have no loss exposure

these concessions include modifications of the terms of the debt such as reduction of the stated interest rate other than normal market rate adjustments  extension of maturity dates  or reduction of principal balance or accrued interest 
the decision to restructure a loan  versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan  may benefit the corporation by increasing the ultimate probability of collection 
included in nonaccrual loans at december  and  are loans whose terms have been restructured amounting to thousand and million  respectively 
there were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans had been restructured 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo is comprised of properties acquired through foreclosure and other legal means  and loans determined to be substantively repossessed 
a loan is considered to be substantively repossessed when the corporation has taken possession of the collateral  but has not completed legal foreclosure proceedings 
oreo is carried at the lower of cost or fair value minus estimated costs to sell 
a valuation allowance is maintained for potential declines in market value  known declines in market value  and estimated selling costs 
the balance of oreo amounted to thousand at december   down from the prior year amount of thousand 
decreases in oreo resulted from sales of foreclosed properties and repossessed assets that exceeded the level of foreclosures and repossessions 
during  proceeds from sales of foreclosed properties and repossessed assets amounted to thousand 
washington trust has provided financing to facilitate the sales of some of these properties 
financing is generally provided at market rates with credit terms similar to those available to other borrowers 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents the amount available for credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
washington trust assesses the quality of its loans by performing ongoing reviews of its portfolio to determine potential loss exposure and to assess delinquency trends 
during this review  management gives consideration to such factors as overall borrower relationship  delinquency trends  credit and collateral quality  prior loss experience  prevailing economic and business conditions  industry concentrations  the size and characteristics of the loan portfolio and other pertinent factors 
based on this review  the management believes that its year end allowance for loan losses is adequate 
loans are charged off once the probability of loss has been established  through the review of the factors mentioned above 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily judgmental and involves consideration of various factors and assumptions 
management believes that an allocation of the allowance is not necessarily indicative of the specific amount of future charge offs or the specific loan categories in which these charge offs may ultimately occur 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses represents management s evaluation of the loan portfolio  including its size and complexity  with consideration given to the corporation s expanded market area and industry concentrations 
also  management realizes that there are losses that have been incurred within the portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified

the corporation and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements 
the corporation and the bank are categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of capital requirements 
litigation the bank is party to a lawsuit filed by a former corporate customer and the customer s shareholders for damages which the plaintiffs allegedly incurred as a result of an embezzlement by an officer of the customer 
the suit as originally filed sought recovery from the bank for losses directly related to the embezzlement of approximately million  as well as consequential damages amounting to approximately million 
on march   the customer amended its claims to seek recovery of an additional million in losses  plus an unspecified amount of interest thereon  which were alleged to be directly related to the embezzlement 
on or about november   the customer further amended its claim to now seek recovery of approximately million in total damages  plus an unspecified amount of interest thereon 
management believes  based on its review with counsel of the development of this matter to date that the bank has asserted meritorious affirmative defenses in this litigation 
additionally  the bank has filed counterclaims against the customer and its principal shareholder  as well as claims against the officer allegedly responsible for the embezzlement 
the bank is vigorously asserting its defenses and affirmative claims 
the case is currently in discovery and is currently scheduled for trial in late april because of the numerous uncertainties that surround the litigation  management and legal counsel are unable to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that the bank may incur with respect to this litigation 
consequently  no loss provision for this lawsuit has been recorded 
year the statements in the following section include year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
during  the corporation completed a detailed assessment of all its information technology it and non information technology non it systems with respect to the century date change the transition from the year to  with special emphasis on mission critical systems 
it and non it hardware and software were inventoried and those not year ready were identified  remediated and tested 
while the corporation s assessment of year issues is ongoing and subject to on going regulatory mandated verification and review through march   the corporation has not yet experienced any effects from year issues 
the corporation expects that the total costs associated with the project will amount to approximately thousand 
the corporation has accounted for most of these costs as expense items 
in some cases  acquired hardware and software items were capitalized and amortized in accordance with the corporation s existing accounting policy 
total costs incurred through december  amounted to approximately thousand 
these costs consisted primarily of system testing and modification  internal staffing and consulting  and were primarily recorded in noninterest expenses 
the remaining project costs will be incurred in the first half of the costs of the project are based on management s best estimates  which are derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies  or outside vendors  on which the corporation s systems rely  have been fully remedied 
therefore  the corporation could possibly experience a negative impact to the extent other entities not affiliated with the corporation are not year compliant 
the corporation s risk management program includes emergency backup and recovery procedures to be followed in the event of failure of a business critical system 
these procedures were expanded to include specific procedures for potential year issues  and contingency plans to protect against year related interruptions 
these plans include backup procedures and identification of alternative suppliers

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity and liquidity interest rate risk is one of the major market risks faced by the corporation 
the corporation s asset liability committee alco is responsible for establishing policy guidelines on liquidity and acceptable exposure to interest rate risk 
the objective of the alco is to manage assets and funding sources to produce results which are consistent with washington trust s liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the alco establishes and monitors guidelines for proper origination and matching of assets and funding sources  and determines asset liability origination and pricing strategies to meet its goals 
the alco meets regularly to review the economic environment and the volume  mix and maturity of assets and liabilities  and implements appropriate changes in strategy that will manage the corporation s exposure to interest rate risk and liquidity risk 
the alco manages the corporation s interest rate risk using income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in the corporation s on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments at a given point in time by showing the effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income over a month period 
the alco uses both parallel and non parallel rate shifts of up to basis points and monte carlo rate simulations based on the historical volatility of interest rates to perform income simulations 
the simulations assume that the composition of the corporation s balance sheet remains constant over the month simulation horizon  and take into account the specific repricing  maturity  call options  and prepayment characteristics of differing financial instruments that may vary under different interest rate scenarios 
prepayment estimates for the corporation s loans are based on historical experience 
call options and prepayment characteristics for securities are calculated using industry standard pricing and prepayment estimates 
non contractual savings deposits are classified as short term three months or less for both maturity and repricing purposes 
the characteristics of financial instrument classes are reviewed periodically by the alco to ensure their accuracy and consistency 
the alco reviews simulation results to determine whether the negative exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates remains within established tolerance levels over a month horizon  and to develop appropriate strategies to manage this exposure 
in addition  the alco reviews month horizon results to assess longer term risk inherent in the balance sheet  although no month horizon tolerance levels are specified 
as of december  and december   net interest income simulation indicated exposure to changing interest rates over a month horizon to a degree that remained within tolerance levels established by the corporation 
the corporation defines maximum unfavorable net interest income exposure to be a change of no more than in net interest income over the first months and no more than over the second months of the simulation horizon 
the following table summarizes the effect that interest rate shifts would have on net interest income for a month period using the corporation s on and off balance sheet financial instruments as of december  interest rates are assumed to shift by a parallel basis points over a month period  except for core savings deposits  which are assumed to shift by only basis points due to their historical insensitivity to rate changes 
further  core savings are assumed to have certain minimum rate levels below that they will not fall 
it should be noted that the rate scenario used does not necessarily reflect the alco s view of the most likely change in interest rates over the next months 
furthermore  since a static balance sheet is assumed  the results do not reflect the anticipated future net interest income of the corporation for the same period 
the following table presents these month net interest income simulation results dollars in thousands flat falling rising rates rates rates interest earning assets fixed rate mortgage backed securities    adjustable rate mortgage backed securities    callable securities    other securities    fixed rate mortgages    adjustable rate mortgages    other fixed rate loans    other adjustable rate loans    interest rate floor contracts net of premium amortization total interest income    interest bearing liabilities core savings deposits    time deposits    short term borrowings federal home loan bank advances    total interest expense    net interest income results as of december     net interest income results as of december     represents washington trust bancorp  inc historical results as previously reported in the corporation s annual report on form k 
the alco estimates that the negative exposure of net interest income to rising rates results from a gradual balance sheet shift toward longer term fixed rate assets and away from variable rate assets during the shift reflects increased customer demand for fixed rate loans as interest rates declined throughout the year 
in the event of an increase in interest rates  funding costs may rise more rapidly than asset yields over the near term  reducing interest income 
conversely  net interest income may increase as rates fall because shorter term liabilities would decrease in cost over the near term  while yields on fixed rate assets decline more slowly 
while the alco reviews simulation assumptions to ensure that they are reasonable and current  income simulation may not always prove to be an accurate indicator of interest rate risk since the repricing  maturity and prepayment characteristics of financial instruments  especially core savings deposits  may change to a different degree than estimated 
in addition  since income simulations assume that the corporation s balance sheet will remain static over the month simulation horizon  the results do not reflect adjustments in strategy that the alco could implement in response to rate shifts 
the corporation also monitors the potential change in market value of its available for sale debt securities in parallel rate shifts of up to basis points 
the purpose is to determine market value exposure which may not be captured by income simulation  but which might result in changes to the corporation s capital position 
results are calculated using industry standard analytical techniques and securities data 
the corporation uses the results to manage the effect of market value changes on the corporation s capital position 
the following table summarizes the potential change in market value of the corporation s available for sale debt securities as of december  and resulting from immediate basis point parallel rate shifts dollars in thousands falling rising rates rates security type us treasury and government sponsored agency securities noncallable us government sponsored agency securities callable  corporate securities   fixed rate mortgage backed securities   adjustable rate mortgage backed securities   fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations adjustable rate collateralized mortgage obligations  total change in market value as of december    total change in market value as of december    represents washington trust bancorp  inc historical results as previously reported in the corporation s annual report on form k 
the corporation also monitors the potential change in market value of its available for sale debt securities using value at risk analysis 
value at risk analysis measures the theoretical maximum market value loss over a given time period based on recent historical price activity of different classes of securities 
the anticipated maximum market value reduction for the bank s available for sale securities portfolio at december   including both debt and equity securities  was  assuming a one year time horizon and a probability of occurrence for value at risk analysis 
at december   gap analysis showed that the corporation s cumulative one year gap was a negative million  or of earning assets 
the following table details the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  that are expected to mature or reprice in each of the time periods presented 
to the extent applicable  amounts of assets and liabilities that mature or reprice within a particular period were determined in accordance with their contractual terms 
fixed rate mortgages  mortgage backed securities and consumer installment loans have been allocated based on expected amortization and prepayment rates using standard industry assumptions 
savings  now and money market deposit accounts  which have no contractual term and are subject to immediate repricing  are presented in the under three month category 
management believes that gap analysis has substantial limitations as a measure of interest rate risk  as it does not address the effect of changes in interest rates nor the magnitude of resulting changes in net interest income 
for this reason  the alco does not use gap analysis to establish interest rate risk targets or assess interest rate risk exposure 
the following table summarizes the corporation s gap analysis as of december  dollars in thousands months to months to over or less months to year years years interest earning assets loans      debt securities      other   total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities deposits     short term borrowings  federal home loan bank advances      total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap per period      cumulative interest sensitivity gap      cumulative interest sensitivity gap      represents washington trust bancorp  inc historical amounts as previously reported in the corporation s annual report on form k 
on occasion  the corporation has supplemented its interest rate risk management strategies with off balance sheet transactions 
such transactions are intended to hedge specifically identified risks inherent in the corporation s balance sheet  and not to produce speculative profits 
the corporation has written policy guidelines that designate limits on the notional value of off balance sheet transactions and require periodic evaluation of risks associated with these transactions  including counterparty credit risk 
during  the corporation entered into interest rate floor contracts with a notional principal amount of million and a five year term maturing in february during  the corporation entered into additional floor contracts with a notional principal amount of million and a five year term maturing in march these contracts are intended to function as a hedge against reductions in interest income realized from prime based loans 
these contracts were purchased for a total premium of million  which is amortized over the life of the contracts 
the corporation receives payment for these contracts if certain interest rates fall below specified levels 
during  the corporation recorded income  net of premium amortization  of thousand on its floor contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the floor contracts 
liquidity is the ability of a financial institution to meet maturing liability obligations and customer loan demand 
washington trust s primary source of liquidity is customer deposits 
customer deposits time  savings and demand deposits funded approximately of total average assets in other sources of funding include discretionary use of purchased liabilities ie  federal home loan bank term advances  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased  cash flows from the corporation s securities portfolios and loan repayments 
in addition  securities designated as available for sale may be sold in response to short term or long term liquidity needs
