item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data included as item of this annual report on form k and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included as item of this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties

overview pegasus is a leading provider of transaction processing and electronic commerce services to the hotel industry worldwide 
pegasus is organized into three businesses pegasus electronic distribution  pegasus commission processing and pegasus business intelligence 
pegasus electronic distribution 
pegasus electronic distribution includes the gds distribution service and internet based distribution services 
these services improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the hotel reservation process by enabling travel agents and individual travelers to electronically access hotel room inventory information and conduct reservation transactions 
our gds distribution service provides an electronic interface between a hotel s central reservation system and the global distribution systems that travel agents use to book hotel and airline reservations 
pegasus derives revenues from this service by charging hotel participants a fee based on the number of reservations made  less the number cancelled net reservations  and a fee for status messages processed through the gds distribution service 
status messages are electronic messages sent by hotels to global distribution systems to update room rates  features and availability information in global distribution system databases 
as a hotel s cumulative volume of net reservations increases during the course of the calendar year  its fee per transaction decreases after predetermined transaction volume hurdles have been met 
as a result  for higher volume customers  unit transaction fees are higher at the beginning of the year  when cumulative transactions are lower 
pegasus recognizes revenues based on the fee per transaction that a customer is expected to pay during the entire year 
pegasus interim balance sheets reflect a liability for the difference between the fee per transaction that pegasus actually bills a customer during the period and the average fee per transaction that a customer is expected to pay for the entire year 
the liability created during the early periods of the year is eliminated by the end of each year as the fee per transaction that pegasus actually bills a customer falls below the average fee per transaction for the entire year 
pegasus offers volume based discounting of the gds distribution service fees 
the recent consolidation in the hotel industry has resulted in a lower average fee per transaction for the gds distribution service 
despite increases in the number of transactions  revenues generated from the gds distribution service have remained consistent with prior periods 
pegasus expects this trend to continue 
additionally  pegasus generally charges new participants in the gds distribution service a one time set up fee for work performed to establish the connection between a hotel s central reservation system and the pegasus electronic distribution technology 
revenue for these one time set up fees is recognized ratably over the set up period  which generally ranges from two to four months 
during the set up period  pegasus establishes an electronic communication link with the hotel s central reservation system and performs testing to ensure proper delivery of data and transactions between the hotel and each distribution channel 
pegasus also charges some global distribution systems a fee based on either the number of net reservations or the number of hotels connected to the global distribution system to compensate for the management and consolidation of multiple interfaces 
our internet based distribution services provide online hotel reservation capabilities to travelers via our travelweb 
com website www 
travelweb 
com and our private label reservation service 
to participate in the internet based distribution services  hotels pay pegasus subscription fees based on the number of the hotel company s properties in pegasus online distribution database 
for reservations that originate on the travelweb 
com website  pegasus charges either a transaction fee based on the number of net reservations made at participating properties or a commission based on the value of the guest stay 
for reservations that originate on websites using the private label reservation service  pegasus charges transaction fees based on the number of net reservations made at participating properties 
private label reservation customers also pay initial development fees and either monthly subscription or maintenance fees 
initial development fees are for establishing an electronic communication link between the hotel s central reservation system and third party websites 
maintenance fees are for the management of the communication link and the online distribution database 
pegasus commission processing 
pegasus commission processing provides hotel commission payment processing 
pegasus commission processing improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the commission payment process for participating hotels and travel agencies by consolidating payments  paying in local currency and providing comprehensive transaction reports 
pegasus commission processing derives revenues by charging a participating travel agency a fee based on a percentage of the commissions paid by hotels and hotel chains that are processed by pegasus on behalf of that agency 
pegasus also generally charges a participating hotel a fee based on the number of commissionable transactions arising from that hotel that are processed by pegasus 
revenues from travel agency fees can vary substantially from period to period based on the types of hotels at which reservations are made and fluctuations in overall room rates 
pegasus commission processing recognizes revenues in the month in which the hotel stay occurs 
in the following month  pegasus collects commissions from the hotels by the th business day of the month and pays commissions to travel agencies by the th business day of the month 
if a hotel fails to deliver funds to pegasus  pegasus is not obligated to deliver commission payments on behalf of the hotel to travel agencies 
during  pegasus processed approximately million in commissions for participating agencies 
pegasus typically retains as its commission processing fee approximately of the commissions processed on behalf of the participating agency 
pegasus business intelligence 
pegasus business intelligence provides database marketing and consulting services 
pegasus business intelligence also is being expanded to provide services that search and organize data into meaningful information for competitive analysis and strategic planning for the hotel industry 
pegasus business intelligence revenues consist of fees charged to hotels for the development of hotel databases and for consulting services 
historically  pegasus has derived a majority of its revenues from its electronic distribution and commission processing services 
for the year ended december   approximately of consolidated revenues were derived from pegasus electronic distribution  approximately of consolidated revenues were derived from pegasus commission processing and approximately of consolidated revenues were derived from pegasus business intelligence 
pegasus has experienced substantial growth since its inception 
however  there can be no assurance that pegasus will experience the same rate of revenue growth in the future 
any significant decrease in the rate of revenue growth could have a material adverse effect on pegasus operating results and financial condition 
pegasus has developed or is in the process of developing several new services to capitalize on its existing technology and customer base and to provide additional electronic hotel reservation capabilities and information services to its existing customers and to other participants in the hotel room distribution process 
pegasus electronic distribution has introduced services that automate the processing of hotel bookings for large meetings and conventions and for corporate travelers 
pegasus business intelligence intends to introduce data mining and reporting services for benchmark analysis and strategic planning for the hotel industry 
pegasus has not received a material amount of revenue from these services  and there can be no assurance that any of these services will produce a material amount of revenue in the future 
pegasus future success will depend  in part  on its ability to develop leading technologies enhance existing services develop and introduce new services that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of current and prospective customers respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis pegasus cost of services consists principally of personnel costs relating to information technology  facilities and equipment maintenance costs and fees paid to the processing bank for processing travel agency commissions

general and administrative expenses are primarily personnel  office  legal and accounting related

in determining the valuation pegasus identified eight projects as in process research and development 
of these eight  three were associated with a market planner product  three with a database product and two were internet enabled query tools 
each project was estimated to have a specific revenue stream that was assumed to generate a cash flow margin over a ten year period 
each project was determined to be at a certain stage of completion ranging from to  and these factors were applied to the present value of each project s future cash flows using a discount rate 
the resulting million valuation was charged to operations in subsequent to the driving revenue acquisition  pegasus re evaluated the role of the market planner product 
since the market planner is a stand alone software sale that does not fit with pegasus business strategy  pegasus has elected to stop selling it and terminated work on the development of the three market planner projects 
pegasus has elected to focus its efforts on projects that better fit with its strategy of producing recurring revenues from customers 
pegasus management believes that the decision not to develop the acquired technology will have no impact on future results of operations or financial position
