item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of cerus should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
cerus actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview since its inception in  cerus has devoted substantially all of its efforts and resources to the research  development and clinical testing of systems based on its platform technologies  which prevent nucleic acid dna and rna replication 
cerus has been unprofitable since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
all of cerus systems are in the research and development stage  and cerus has not received any revenue from product sales 
cerus will be required to conduct significant research  development  pre clinical and clinical evaluation and regulatory compliance activities on these systems that  together with anticipated general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial losses at least until after commercialization of its products under development 
cerus ability to achieve a profitable level of operations in the future will depend on its ability to successfully complete development  obtain regulatory approvals and achieve market acceptance of its pathogen inactivation systems 
cerus may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
further  under the agreements discussed below  a significant portion of cerus development funding is provided by baxter based on an annual budgeting process 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be modified or terminated 
agreement with baxter for the development of pathogen inactivation systems for platelets 
cerus has a development and commercialization agreement with baxter for the joint development of a system for inactivation of viruses  bacteria and other infectious pathogens in platelets used for transfusion the platelet agreement 
the platelet agreement provides for baxter and cerus to generally share system development costs equally  subject to mutually determined budgets established from time to time  and for cerus to receive of revenue from sales of inactivation system disposables after each party is reimbursed for its cost of goods above a specified level 
the platelet agreement also provides for baxter to make a million cash milestone payment to cerus upon approval by the fda of an application to market products developed under the platelet program  comparable approval in europe or termination of the platelet system development program 
cerus has received a million equity investment under the platelet agreement from baxter and has recognized million in revenue from baxter cumulatively through december   including million in license fees  million in milestone payments and million in development funding 
license fees and payments for achieved milestones are non refundable and are not subject to future performance 
development funding is in the form of balancing payments made by baxter to cerus  if necessary  to reimburse cerus for development spending in excess of the levels agreed to by baxter and cerus 
development funding revenue is recognized as the related project costs are incurred 
agreement with baxter for the development of pathogen inactivation systems for red blood cells and ffp 
cerus also has a development and commercialization agreement with baxter for the joint development of systems for inactivation of viruses  bacteria and other infectious pathogens in red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma ffp the rbc ffp agreement 
the rbc ffp agreement provides for baxter and cerus generally to share red blood cell system development costs equally  subject to mutually determined budgets established from time to time 
the rbc ffp agreement also provides for an equal sharing of revenue from sales of red blood cell inactivation disposables after each party is reimbursed for its cost of goods and a specified percentage allocation  not to exceed of revenue  is retained by baxter for marketing and administrative expenses 
under the rbc ffp agreement  cerus and baxter equally funded the ffp program development through december   after which time baxter s funding commitment for the ffp development program was limited to million  which offset payments owed to baxter in january and january baxter has an exclusive  worldwide distribution license and will be responsible for manufacturing and marketing the ffp product 
the rbc ffp agreement also provides for cerus to receive and baxter to receive of revenue from sales of ffp inactivation system disposables after each party is reimbursed for its cost of goods and a specified percentage allocation  not to exceed of revenue  is retained by baxter for marketing and administrative expenses 
under the rbc ffp agreement  cerus received million in equity investments from baxter and recognized million in revenue from baxter cumulatively through december  to fund the development of the red blood cell and ffp systems 
development funding is in the form of payments made by baxter to cerus  if necessary  to reimburse cerus for development spending in excess of the levels agreed to by baxter and cerus 
development funding revenue is recognized as the related project costs are incurred 
agreement with the consortium for plasma science 
in december  cerus and the consortium entered into an agreement for the development of a pathogen inactivation system for source plasma used for fractionation 
the consortium is co funded by four plasma fractionation companies alpha therapeutics corporation  aventis behring  bayer corporation and baxter 
the consortium  which is a separate entity from its members  provides research and development funding worldwide for technologies to improve the safety of plasma derivative products 
under the agreement  the consortium is funding development of cerus proprietary technology for use with source plasma  subject to an annual review process 
subject to the consortium meeting certain funding requirements  cerus will pay the consortium a royalty based on a percentage of product sales  if any 
the initial term of the agreement expires on june  there is no guarantee that the agreement will be renewed 
results of operations compared with revenue 
cerus anticipates that its sources of revenue until product sales occur will be limited to payments under collaboration agreements  including cerus development and commercialization agreements with baxter and development agreement with the consortium  and payments from the united states government under research grant programs 
for the year ended december   development revenue from baxter and the consortium decreased to million from million for revenue earned under the agreements with baxter is dependent on the relative spending by cerus and baxter on the programs for which development costs are shared 
the decrease in revenue from baxter was primarily a result of cerus being solely responsible for funding the ffp program in  whereas baxter partially funded this program in additionally  development revenue from baxter for the red blood cell pathogen inactivation system for was significantly less than in  as baxter s relative share of expenses for this program increased in decreased revenue from baxter was partially offset by million of development revenue from the consortium in cerus did not recognize any revenue from the consortium in government grant revenue decreased to million for  compared to million for cerus current government grant expires in there can be no assurance that cerus will receive additional government grants in the future 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to a one time expense of million in which related to cerus purchase of an increased share of future platelet pathogen inactivation system revenue 
in addition  cerus incurred research and development expenses during related to an amendment to the platelet agreement  under which cerus funded million of development costs previously to be funded by baxter 
in  cerus and baxter shared the development costs of the platelet program equally 
excluding the effects of these items in  research and development expenses increased  due to the addition of scientific personnel  increased costs for toxicology studies and clinical trials and increased expenses incurred for fee for service development activities at baxter relating to the ffp program 
cerus anticipates that its research and development expenses will continue to increase as phase clinical trials of its platelet and ffp systems continue  and as research and development activity relating to its other programs increases 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel levels associated with the expansion of cerus operations 
cerus expects its general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as it expands its development activities 
net interest income 
net interest income increased to million for from million for the increase was attributable primarily to increased average cash balances related to proceeds from cerus public offering of common stock in april and private placements of common and preferred stock to baxter 
cerus typically maintains substantial balances of cash equivalents and short term investments to fund future research and development activities 
cerus expects to earn interest at market rates in proportion to the securities balances it maintains 
compared with revenue 
for and  cerus primary source of revenue was development funding from baxter 
revenue earned under the agreements with baxter is dependent on the relative spending by cerus and baxter on the programs for which development costs are shared 
for the year ended december   development revenue from baxter decreased to million from million for the decrease was primarily due to an increase in baxter s relative share of development expenses for the platelet and red blood cell programs  and cerus agreement to fund a portion of baxter s development commitment for the platelet system in government grant revenue increased to million for  compared to million for research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to increased third party costs relating to toxicology studies and clinical trials  and costs related to increased personnel 
in addition  under amendments to the platelet agreement  cerus recognized research and development expenses in and of million and million  respectively  to increase its share of platelet pathogen inactivation system adjusted product revenue from to 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel levels associated with the expansion of cerus operations 
net interest income 
net interest income  relatively unchanged between the two years  was million in and liquidity and capital resources cerus sources of capital to date have consisted of public and private placements of equity securities  development funding by baxter and the consortium  united states government grants and interest income 
to date  cerus has not received any revenue from product sales  and it will not derive revenue from product sales unless and until one or more planned products receives regulatory approval and achieves market acceptance 
in march  baxter purchased  shares of series b preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
from april until march  a premium equal to per annum on the purchase price is being accrued 
the premium is payable in cash to baxter in march at any time after one year from issuance  the holder may convert the series b preferred stock into  common shares 
cerus has the right to redeem the series b preferred stock prior to conversion for a payment to baxter equal to the aggregate purchase price of the shares redeemed 
in april  cerus completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at per share and received net proceeds of million  after deducting offering expenses 
also in april  cerus sold  shares of common stock to baxter pursuant to cerus achievement of a milestone under the rbc ffp agreement 
the purchase price was per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
at december   cerus had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
in february  cerus completed a private placement of  shares of common stock at per share and received net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting estimated offering expenses 
the shares were purchased by institutional and other accredited investors  including baxter  which purchased  shares 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million in  compared to million in the use of cash primarily resulted from a net loss of million and a decrease in accounts payable to baxter of million 
accounts payable to baxter decreased primarily due to payments to baxter in net cash used in investing activities in of approximately million resulted principally from purchases of million of short term investments offset by the sale and maturities of million of short term investments and the purchase of million of furniture and equipment 
working capital increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to increases in short term investments balances and the decrease in accounts payable to baxter 
cerus believes that its available cash balances  together with cash flows from existing development and grant arrangements  will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
these near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including the development progress of cerus pathogen inactivation systems and other programs  payments by baxter and the consortium  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending cerus intellectual property position 
cerus long term capital requirements will be dependent on these factors and on cerus ability to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financings or through additional collaborative arrangements or government grants  the achievement of milestones  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of cerus pathogen inactivation systems and other products under development  competitive developments and regulatory factors 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to investors in cerus 
capital may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
there can be no assurance that cerus will be able to meet its capital requirements for this or any other period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cerus maintains an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  if material 
unrealized gains and losses at december  and were not material 
cerus investments primarily consist of short term money market mutual funds  united states and state government obligations and commercial paper 
of cerus investments balance of million at december   approximately have original maturity dates of less than days  have original maturities of days to one year and the remaining balance have maturities of two years or less 
cerus does not believe its exposure to interest rate risk to be material given the short term nature of its investment portfolio
