item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the table below sets forth results of operations for the years ended december   and expressed as a percentage of revenues as percent of revenues year ended december  revenues direct costs salaries and wages payroll taxes  worker s compensation premiums  employee benefits and other costs gross profit operating expenses administrative salaries  wages and employment taxes other selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income other income expense  net income before taxes provision for income taxes net income loss overview reference should be made to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information concerning revenue recognition and other related information 
our primary direct costs are salaries and wages of worksite employees  federal and state employment taxes  workers compensation premiums  premiums for employee benefits and other associated costs 
we may significantly affect our gross profit margin by how we manage our employment risks  including workers compensation and state unemployment costs  as described below 
our risk management of the worksite includes policies and procedures designed to proactively prevent and control the costs of claims  lawsuits  fines  penalties  judgments  settlements and legal and professional fees 
in addition  we control benefit plan costs by attempting to prevent fraud and abuse 
other risk management programs include effectively processing workers compensation and unemployment claims and aggressively contesting suspicious or improper claims 
we also reduce our employment related risks by procuring employment practices liability coverage from an insurance carrier unrelated to us 
the policy has a  aggregate limit and a  deductible 
we believe that such risk management efforts increase our profitability by reducing our liability exposure and by increasing the value of our services to our clients 
workers compensation costs include administrative costs and insurance premiums related to our workers compensation coverage 
with respect to worksite employees located in ohio  we became self insured in with respect to our worksite employees located outside of ohio  we maintain workers compensation insurance policies generally with private insurance companies in accordance with the applicable laws of each state in which we have worksite employees 
the cost of contesting workers compensation claims is borne by us and is not passed through directly to our clients 
our worksite employees currently reside in approximately states and the district of columbia  resulting in the payment by us of unemployment taxes in each of such states 
such taxes are based on rates that vary from state to state 
employers are generally subject to established minimum rates  however  the aggregate rates payable by an employer are affected by the employer s claims history 
we control unemployment claims by aggressively contesting unfounded claims and by placing laid off worksite employees with other clients whenever possible 
our primary operating expenses are administrative personnel expenses  other general and administrative expenses  and sales and marketing expenses 
administrative personnel expenses include compensation and fringe benefits and other personnel expenses related to internal administrative employees 
other general and administrative expenses include rent  insurance  general office expenses  legal and accounting fees and other operating expenses 
between september  and april   we acquired seven competitor peo companies located outside of ohio 
a peo located within ohio was acquired in march and a peo located in san diego  california was acquired in december all of these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases for accounting purposes 
accordingly  the revenues and expenses of these acquired businesses are included in our income statements only from the date of acquisition forward and impact comparisons of results from to and year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  if the five businesses acquired in had been acquired as of january   then our total revenues in would have been  and our pro forma growth rate for would be 
direct costs total direct costs increased to  in from  in direct costs increased to of total revenues in from of total revenues in during we incurred approximately  or  in additional costs in connection with expenses primarily related to acquired entities and not to our core business 
in addition  there were additional costs associated with medical and liability insurance programs and with additional payroll expense and payroll tax accruals 
the decline in margin also is the result of lower fees and margins in the acquired businesses  which constitute a larger percentage of the total revenue in than in our core business  located primarily in ohio  has historically had margins in excess of margins in the acquired businesses outside of ohio 
we continue to view the lower fees and margins in the acquired businesses as opportunities for future profitability improvement 
expenses administrative salaries  wages and employment taxes declined 
to  in from  in these costs declined to of total revenues in from of total revenues in while the decrease in this expense category includes the staffing at all locations for an entire year  we were able to develop additional savings from the use of our centralized payroll  hr and accounting software package operating at all locations in other selling  general and administrative expense increased to  in from  in in addition to the increased costs from the acquired companies for a full year  expenses also rose for commissions  rent  phones  equipment leases  bank charges  computer expenses  and professional fees

this accounted for of the increase from these costs declined to of revenue in from in depreciation and amortization expense rose to  in from  in depreciation expense increased as a result of the acquisition of computer equipment and software during the past year 
amortization expense is the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles arising from the acquisitions  and it increased slightly during due to a full year of amortization for acquisitions

income from operations operating income loss declined by  to  in from  in approximately  of additional costs in related primarily to acquired entities and not to our core business 
in addition  there were additional costs associated with medical and liability insurance programs and additional payroll expense and payroll tax accruals 
we also accrued  at year end for fees associated with the termination of the global merger 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is defined by us as operating income plus depreciation and amortization 
ebitda  which excludes depreciation and amortization expense of  in the period compared to  in the period  decreased to  in from  in other income expense other income expense is primarily net interest income or expense 
during interest expense exceeded interest income  due primarily to new borrowings to fund a  purchase of treasury shares 
interest income in was primarily from the investment of the funds remaining from prior ipo proceeds 
income tax expense income tax expense was  in compared to  in income tax expense occurs in because the goodwill amortization is not a deductible expense for tax purposes  this increases taxes by approximately  annually 
in the income tax expense was of pre tax income

our core business  located primarily in ohio  has historically had margins in excess of 
margins in the acquired businesses outside of ohio were in we view the lower fees and margins in the acquired businesses as opportunity for future profitability improvement 
expenses administrative salaries  wages and employment taxes rose to  in from  in these costs declined to of total revenues in from of total revenues in the increase in this expense category reflects the staffing at the increased number of locations from the acquisitions 
however  the acquired entities had lower expenses as a percentage of revenues leading to the decline as a percentage of revenues 
other selling  general and administrative expense increased to  in from  in in addition to the increased costs from the acquired companies  expenses also rose for liability and employment practices insurance  printing for new marketing and employee benefits literature for the acquired companies  travel  professional fees and facilities costs 
these costs are not expected to continue to increase at a greater pace than revenues 
additional savings are also expected once our new centralized payroll  hr and accounting software package is deployed and operating at all locations in depreciation and amortization expense rose to  in from  in depreciation expense increased as a result of the acquisition of computer equipment and software during the past year 
amortization expense is the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles arising from the acquisitions

through december   the entire amount was invested 
by december   the balance remaining had declined to approximately  and had further declined to approximately  at december  as a result of using the proceeds to acquire competitors 
income tax expense income tax expense was  or of income before taxes in compared to  or of income before taxes in income tax expense rose as a percent of pre tax income in because the goodwill amortization is not a deductible expense for tax purposes 
the tax provision in also benefited from the investment income  almost half of which was from tax free municipal bonds

in basic earnings per share were 
and diluted earnings per share were 
in average shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share increased to  in compared to  in due to the shares issued for acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had a working capital deficit of  a decline of  from the december  working capital surplus of  the decrease in working capital correlates with the decrease in earnings 
our primary source of liquidity and capital resources has historically been our internal cash flow from operations 
however  in  the reduction in operating income was a major factor in a decline in cash flow from operations from  in to  in we recognize as revenue and as unbilled receivables  on an accrual basis  any such amounts that relate to services performed by worksite employees as of the end of each accounting period which have not yet been billed to the client 
these occur because of timing differences between the date our accounting period ends and the billing dates for client payroll periods that include the day our accounting period ends 
the amount of unbilled receivables  as well as the related accrued liabilities  has increased with our growth 
for work performed prior to the termination of a client agreement  we may be obligated  as an employer  to pay the gross salaries and wages of the client s worksite employees and the related employment taxes and workers  compensation costs  whether or not our client pays us on a timely basis  or at all 
we historically have not incurred significant bad debt expenses because we generally collect from our clients all revenues with respect to each payroll period in advance of our payment of the direct costs associated therewith 
we attempt to minimize our credit risk by investigating and monitoring the credit history and financial strength of our clients and by generally requiring payments be made by wire transfer  immediately available funds or ach transfer 
with respect to ach transfers  we are obligated to pay the client s worksite employees even if there are insufficient funds in the client s bank account on the payroll date 
our policy  however  is only to permit clients with a proven credit history with us to pay by ach transfer 
in addition  in the rare event of nonpayment by a client  we have the ability to terminate immediately our contract with the client 
we also protect ourselves by obtaining  when we deem necessary  unconditional personal guarantees from the owners of a client and or a cash security deposit  bank letter of credit or pledge of certificates of deposits 
as of december  and  we held cash security deposits in the amounts of  and  respectively 
additional sources of funds are advance payments of employment taxes and insurance premiums that we hold until they are due and payable to the respective taxing authorities and insurance providers 
net cash used in investing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the principal use of cash from investing activities in was the purchase of computer equipment and software to support the growth of the business 
in   was paid to former executives of our oregon location for covenants not to compete in connection with their resignation from our company 
in the second quarter of   was borrowed from a bank and was fully collateralized by a short term certificate of deposit 
the certificate of deposit and the related borrowing were retired in october during   was paid toward the purchase of five peo companies 
in addition to the cash paid for acquisitions   and  shares of our common stock were also issued in and since these shares were issued without either an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration  these shares are unregistered restricted shares and cannot be sold for a one year period from the date of issuance 
during the first quarter of   shares of our stock were acquired from our founder and former chairman for  we borrowed  from our bank for this stock acquisition and issued two notes totaling  subsequently  in  we borrowed an additional  from our bank and paid  of the notes to the founder and former chairman 
in connection with an acquisition in  we guaranteed the price of  shares at for the one year period from october  to october  in  we advanced  to the holder of  shares 
we were obligated to pay the holder of the remaining  shares the difference between and the price realized upon sale of the shares 
during   was paid to one of the holders of these shares under this guarantee agreement 
in september  our board of directors approved a share repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
in   shares were repurchased at a cost of  in other financing activities were not material  as we had no debt or significant capital leases 
presently  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
primary new uses of cash may include acquisitions  the size and timing of which cannot be predicted 
however  we are limited in our ability to continue to acquire other peo companies unless we can raise additional capital since most acquisitions involve the payment of cash and the issuance of stock for the purchase price and may also require some additional working capital following acquisition 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and internally generated funds will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements  excluding acquisitions of other peo s for the foreseeable future 
to the extent we need additional capital resources  we believe that we will have access to existing bank financing and other alternative sources of capital 
however  there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
we did not pay dividends in   or  and do not expect to pay a dividend in the foreseeable future 
inflation we believe the effects of inflation have not had a significant impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
quarterly results the following table sets forth certain unaudited operating results of each of the nine consecutive quarters in the period ended december  which comprise all of the quarterly periods following our initial public offering of its common stock on december  the information is unaudited  but in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations of such periods 
this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the results for the first three quarters have been restated to reflect the timing of the  of additional costs to the financial statements due primarily to acquired entities and not to our core business 
in addition  there were costs associated with medical and liability insurance programs and additional payroll expenses
