item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and background the company s sales and net earnings increased significantly through primarily as a result of its acquisitions 
following each acquisition  the company implemented programs to take advantage of distribution and operating synergies among its businesses 
this implementation was reflected in increases in the company s sales and in the decline in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of the company s sales 
however  beginning with the last quarter of and through the company experienced a decline in demand for its commodity related products fixed resistors  mlcc and tantalum capacitors which accounted for approximately of the company s revenues during that time 
such decline in demand resulted in a decrease in revenues  earnings and backlogs of these products 
in order to address the slowdown in demand and price erosion resulting from an oversupply of tantalum and multi layer ceramic chip capacitors  the company implemented a restructuring program beginning in that included the downsizing and closing of manufacturing facilities in north america and europe 
in connection with the restructuring  the company incurred  of pretax charges for the year ended december  relating to employee termination and facility closure costs 
in the company incurred  of restructuring expenses relating to employee termination and facility closure costs in europe 
in the company incurred  of restructuring expenses 
in the late s  the company began to enter into the active components business 
in july  the company purchased a interest in lpsc  a taiwan based company that is a major supplier of discrete active electronic components in asia 
in  the company acquired the semiconductor business group of temic  which included telefunken and of siliconix  producers of transistors  diodes  optoelectronics  and power and analog switching integrated circuits 
since the third quarter of  the company has experienced increasing demand for its products  including both passive and active electronic components 
the company is expanding capacity in all of its major product lines in order to satisfy this demand 
in some cases  the company has been able to increase pricing for its products because of tight supply  reversing the price erosion experienced in prior years 
the company attributes the increased demand for its products to the continuing growth in the wireless telecommunication market  particularly cell phones  and to the increasing use of embedded computing devices in a wide range of consumer and commercial products 
the company s strategy contemplates transferring some of its manufacturing operations from countries with high labor costs and tax rates  such as the united states  france and germany  to israel  mexico  portugal  the czech republic  taiwan and the people s republic of china in order to benefit from lower labor costs and  in the case of israel  to take advantage of various government incentives  including government grants and tax incentives 
notwithstanding the current favorable market conditions  the company intends to continue to explore and implement opportunities for cost efficiencies in its manufacturing operations 
the company realizes approximately of its revenues from customers outside the united states 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can significantly affect the company s reported sales and  to a lesser extent  earnings 
currency fluctuations impact the company s net sales and other income statement amounts  as denominated in us dollars  including other income as it relates to foreign exchange gains or losses 
generally  in order to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on profits  the company endeavors to borrow money in the local currencies and markets where it conducts business  and minimize the time for settling intercompany transactions 
in connection with its day to day operations  the company generally does not purchase foreign currency exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures 
in september  a subsidiary of the company entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exchange rate exposure on certain foreign currency denominated transactions 
as a result of the increased production by the company s operations in israel over the past several years  the low tax rates in israel as compared to the statutory rate in the united states have had the effect of increasing the company s net earnings 
the more favorable israeli tax rates are applied to specific approved projects and are normally available for a period of ten years or  if the investment in the project is over million  for a period of years  which has been the case for most of the company s projects in israel since new projects are continually being introduced 
in addition  the israeli government offers certain incentive programs in the form of grants designed to increase employment in israel 
however  the israeli government has recently scaled back or discontinued some of its incentive programs 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that in the future the israeli government will continue to offer new incentive programs applicable to the company or that  if it does  such programs will provide the same level of benefits the company has historically received or that the company will continue to be eligible to take advantage of them 
the company might be materially adversely affected if these incentive programs were no longer available to the company for new projects 
however  because a majority of the company s projects in israel already benefit from government incentive programs  the company does not anticipate that any cutbacks in the incentive programs would have an adverse impact on its earnings and operations for at least several years 
israeli government grants  recorded as a reduction of costs of products sold  were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the prior year 
if the israeli government continues its grant and incentive programs  future benefits offered to the company by the israeli government will likely depend on the company s continuing to increase capital investment and the number of company employees in israel 
results of operations income statement captions as a percentage of sales and the effective tax rates were as follows year ended december  costs of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income earnings before income taxes and minority interest effective tax rate net earnings year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  increased  or from the prior year

the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies for the year ended december   in comparison to the prior year  resulted in decreases in reported sales of  the passive components business net sales were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the prior year period 
the active components business net sales were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the prior year period 
the sales of the active business reflect increased demand for product  particularly in telecommunication and computer applications and reduced price erosion on its products 
costs of products sold costs of products sold for the year ended december  were of net sales  as compared to for the prior year 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  for the year ended december  increased from the comparable prior year period mainly due to the results of temic 
temic reported gross profit margins of for the year ended december  as compared to for the ten months ended december   mainly due to higher business volume and manufacturing efficiencies gained from the full utilization of existing manufacturing capacity 
the active components business gross margins were for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year period 
the increase is due to the siliconix operation  where gross margins have increased substantially as a result of increased product demand  stronger capacity utilization  an improved product mix and increased fab efficiencies 
the passive components business gross profit margins were for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year period 
profitability for the passive components business was negatively affected by price erosion  which began in the second quarter of however  beginning in the third quarter of  most of the company s product lines have seen an increase in demand and the average selling prices have stopped declining  with prices actually increasing in some instances 
israeli government grants  recorded as a reduction of costs of products sold  were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the prior year 
future grants and other incentive programs offered to the company by the israeli government will likely depend on the company s continuing to increase capital investment and the number of company employees in israel

the tax rate for the year ended december  reflects the non tax deductibility of the loss on the sale of nicolitch  sa tax expense on the sale of nicolitch  sa was  also  a tax rate change in germany resulted in a decrease in german deferred tax assets  which increased tax expense by  exclusive of the effect of the sale of nicolitch  sa and the tax rate change in germany  the effective tax rate on earnings before minority interest for the year ended december  would have been 
the higher tax rate for the year ended december  was primarily due to the non tax deductibility of the in process research and development expense in the fourth quarter and a  increase in a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset for net operating loss carry forwards in germany 
exclusive of the effect of special charges  the tax rate on earnings before minority interest for the year ended december  would have been 
the continuing effect of low tax rates in israel  as compared to the statutory rate in the united states  resulted in increases in net earnings of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  increased  or from the prior year 
the increase in net sales related primarily to the acquisition of temic  which became effective march  net sales of temic for the ten months ended december  included in the company s reported sales were  lpsc was acquired by vishay effective july  lpsc s sales for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the six months ended december  exclusive of temic and lpsc  net sales would have decreased by  or 
the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies for the year ended december  in comparison to the prior year resulted in decreases in reported sales of  moreover  the company s net sales of passive components and semiconductor components were negatively affected by substantial price erosion resulting from oversupply of tantalum and multi layer chip capacitors and the economic downturn in asia 
costs of products sold costs of products sold for the year ended december  were of net sales  as compared to for the prior year 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  for the year ended december  increased from the comparable prior year period mainly due to the acquisition of temic 
temic reported gross profit margins of for the ten months ended december  the passive components business gross profit margins were for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year  reflecting a weakness in the passive components business 
profitability for the passive components business was negatively affected by price erosion from an oversupply of tantalum and multi layer chip capacitors and the depressed asian market 
the results for semiconductor components were also negatively affected by a decrease in demand for products in the semiconductor industry  adjustments of high inventory levels at distributors  the depressed asian market  and substantial price erosion 
israeli government grants  recorded as a reduction of costs of products sold  were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the prior year 
deferred income at december  relating to israeli government grants was  as compared to  at december selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were of net sales  as compared to for the prior year 
the increased selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to the acquisition of temic  for which selling  general and administrative expenses were for the ten months ended december  unusual items the company incurred unusual items of  for the year ended december  approximately  of these items related to impairment losses in connection with certain joint ventures in china and japan 
the remaining  of unusual items related to the company s restructuring of european operations  and closing of two us sales offices 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s impairment losses and restructuring programs 
purchased in process technology in connection with the acquisition of temic  the company expensed million representing purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note to consolidated financial statements 
the in process technology acquired in the temic acquisition was segmented into two categories  process technology and product technology 
process technology is the process by which multiple products can be manufactured 
three separate process technologies were identified  i bondwireless  ii m cell  and iii pic 
micron v 
product technology is the technology behind the development of products 
temic has three primary product categories  i power mos  ii power ic  and iii standard products 
introduction of the new process technologies  if successful  was expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of temic s mosfet products and introduce new ic technology which would reduce die size by approximately 
this would lower production costs per unit and increase margins 
introduction of the product technologies  if successful  was expected to optimize the performance of certain mosfets  diodes and power ics and introduce new applications for certain of temic s products 
these research and development projects were expected to reach completion and begin generating revenues during periods ranging from to at the acquisition date  temic s research and development projects ranged in completion from approximately to  with total continuing research and development commitments to complete the projects of approximately million 
the value assigned to purchased in process research and development was determined by estimating the costs to develop temic s purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the revenue estimates used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of the relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
the estimates for costs of products sold  research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses and income taxes were calculated as a percentage of revenue and were based on historical amounts and were adjusted to reflect competition and advancing technology in the industry 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on weighted average cost of capital and venture capital rates of return 
given the nature of the risks associated with the estimated growth  profitability and development projects  a discount rate of was deemed appropriate for temic s in process projects 
this discount rate was intended to be commensurate with the specific risks of achieving technological feasibility and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
the estimates used by the company in valuing in process research and development were based on assumptions the company believed to be reasonable but which were inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
interest expense interest costs increased by  for the year ended december  from the prior year due to the increase in bank borrowings necessary to fund the temic and lpsc acquisitions 
the company had net borrowings of  and  respectively  from a group of banks to finance the acquisitions of temic and lpsc 
other income other income decreased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year primarily due to reduced foreign exchange gains 
foreign exchange gains for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the company also incurred losses of  and  in and  respectively  relating to a forward exchange contract which was entered into to set the purchase price in connection with the temic acquisition  since the purchase price was denominated in german marks and payable in us dollars 
income taxes the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year 
the higher tax rate for the year ended december  was primarily due to the non tax deductibility of the in process research and development expense and a  increase in a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset for net operating loss carry forwards in germany 
exclusive of the effect of special charges  the tax rate on earnings before minority interest for the year ended december  would have been 
the continuing effect of low tax rates in israel  as compared to the statutory rate in the united states  resulted in increases in net earnings of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the more favorable israeli tax rates are applied to specific approved projects and are normally available for a period of ten or fifteen years 
see description of business manufacturing operations 
financial condition and liquidity cash flows from operations were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
the increase in cash flows from operations is primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net purchases of property and equipment for the year ended december  were  compared to  in the prior year 
the company made  net payments on borrowings during net cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended december  reflects borrowings used to finance the acquisition of temic 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of restructuring costs paid during the company s financial condition at december  is strong  with a current ratio of to the company s ratio of long term debt  less current portion  to stockholders equity was 
to at december  and 
to at december  on march   the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a billion multicurrency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that included an million long term revolving credit and swing line facility and a million short term revolving credit facility 
on june    the company amended the two facilities 
the million long term facility matures on march   subject to vishay s right to request year to year renewals 
the short term facility now provides for a million day facility  which is available until may  borrowings under the two facilities bear interest at variable rates based  at the option of vishay  on the prime rate or a eurocurrency rate and in the case of any swing line advance  the quoted rate 
the borrowings under the two facilities are secured by pledges of stock in certain significant subsidiaries and indirect subsidiaries of vishay and guaranties by certain significant subsidiaries 
the company is required to pay facility fees on the two facilities 
the credit facilities restrict the company from paying cash dividends  and require the company to comply with certain financial covenants 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
management believes that available sources of credit  together with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s anticipated financing needs for working capital and capital expenditures during the next twelve months 
year compliance in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year compliant 
each of the company s divisions implemented a year program designed to address the year issue  of which all programs are now complete 
the company s total cost for these year programs approximated  as a result of these efforts  the company has experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
in addition  the company has not experienced any adverse effects with any of its third party vendors  suppliers or customers 
while the company is not aware of  and does not expect that it will experience  any material problems related to this issue  it will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers  vendors and customers throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
euro conversion on january   of the member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the company is currently evaluating issues raised by the introduction and initial implementation of the euro on january  the company does not expect costs of system modifications to be material  nor does it expect the introduction and use of the euro to materially and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 
the company will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro introduction 
inflation normally  inflation does not have a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company s products are not generally sold on long term contracts 
consequently  selling prices  to the extent permitted by competition  can be adjusted to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
safe harbor statement from time to time  information provided by the company  including but not limited to statements in this report  or other statements made by or on behalf of the company  may contain forward looking information within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
the cautionary statements set forth below identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
changes in product demand  competition  backlog o the company offers a broad variety of products and services to its customers 
changes in demand for  or in the mix of  products and services comprising revenues could cause actual operating results to vary from those expected 
o a slowdown in demand for passive electronic components or recessionary trends in the global economy in general or in specific countries or regions where the company sells the bulk of its products  such as the us  germany  france or the pacific rim  could adversely impact the company s results of operations 
o the company operates in a highly competitive environment  which includes significant competitive pricing pressures and intense competition for entry into new markets 
o many of the orders in the company s backlog may be canceled by its customers without penalty 
customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when backlog is particularly long 
the company s results of operations may be adversely impacted if customers were to cancel a material portion of such orders 
product development  business expansion o the company s future operating results are dependent  in part  on its ability to develop  produce and market new and innovative products  to convert existing products to surface mount devices and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements 
there are numerous risks inherent in this complex process  including the need for the company to timely bring to market new products and applications to meet customers changing needs 
o the company s historic growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from its strategy to expand through acquisitions 
however  there is no assurance that the company will find or consummate transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future 
from time to time  when the company is in the process of pursuing a strategic acquisition  the company or the acquisition target may feel compelled for securities and other legal reasons to announce the potential acquisition or the company s desire to enter into a certain market prior to entering into formal agreements 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will consummate any such acquisition 
o the company may have difficulty expanding its product lines to satisfy the current unusually strong demand for its products 
factors  which could limit such expansion  include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment  shortages of skilled personnel and capacity constraints at the company s facilities 
o the company is currently benefiting from an acute atypical shortage of the company s products 
this shortage has enabled the company to increase prices for certain products and thus increase gross margins 
any drop in demand or increase in supply due to competitors expansion could cause a dramatic drop in average sales prices causing a drop in gross margins 
foreign operations and sales o approximately of the company s revenues are derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
as a result  currency exchange rate fluctuations  inflation  changes in monetary policy and tariffs  potential changes in laws and regulations affecting the company s business in foreign jurisdictions  trade restrictions or prohibitions  intergovernmental disputes  increased labor costs and reduction or cancellation of government grants  tax benefits or other incentives could impact the company s results of operations 
o specifically  as a result of the increased production by the company s operations in israel over the past several years  the low tax rates in israel  as compared to the statutory rates in the us  have had the effect of increasing the company s net earnings 
in addition  the company takes advantage of certain incentive programs in israel in the form of grants designed to increase employment in israel 
any significant increase in the israeli tax rates or reduction or elimination of any of the israeli grant programs  such as described in description of business manufacturing operations could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
restructuring and cost reduction activities o the company may experience underutilization of certain plants and factories in high labor cost regions and capacity constraints in plants and factories located in low labor cost regions  resulting initially in production inefficiencies and higher costs 
such costs include those associated with work force reductions and plant closings in the higher labor cost regions  as described in introduction and background of this item  and start up expenses  manufacturing and construction delays  and increased depreciation costs in connection with the start of production in new plants and expansions in lower labor cost regions 
moreover  capacity constraints may limit the company s ability to continue to meet demand for any of the company s products 
for example  during  restructuring costs were particularly high as a result of the company s accelerated effort to streamline operations in response to the continued weakness in the international electronic components market at the time 
o when the company restructures its operations in response to changing economic conditions  particularly in europe  labor unrest or strikes may occur  which could have an adverse effect on the company 
o the company s strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales offices and administrative functions at acquired companies and achievement of significant production cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to lower cost regions such as israel  mexico  portugal  the czech republic  taiwan and the people s republic of china 
the company s inability to achieve any of these goals could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
raw material costs o the company s results of operations may be adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials  supplies  power  natural resources and any other items needed for the production of the company s products  the effects of quality deviations in raw materials  particularly tantalum powder  palladium and ceramic dielectric materials  and the effects of significant price increases for tantalum or palladium  or an inability to obtain adequate supplies of tantalum or palladium from the limited number of suppliers 
miscellaneous factors o the company s results may also be affected by a variety of other factors  including possible environmental liability and redemption costs  legal proceedings and investigations  possible challenges to the company s intellectual property rights  increases in the company s debt levels or its cost of borrowings  changes in generally accepted accounting policies and practices  disruptions to the company s manufacturing operations that may result from casualty losses  military hostilities particularly in the middle east  or acts of god  and changes in executive personnel 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure the company s cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments

the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
the company monitors its underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believes that it can modify or adapt its hedging strategies as needed 
the company is exposed to changes in us dollar libor interest rates on its floating rate revolving credit facility 
at december   the outstanding balance under this facility was  on a selective basis  the company from time to time enters into interest rate swap or cap agreements to reduce the potential negative impact increases in interest rates could have on its outstanding variable rate debt 
the impact of interest rate instruments on the company s results of operations in each of the three years ended december  was not significant 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements for components of the company s long term debt and interest rate swap arrangements 
in august  the company entered into six interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of  to manage interest rate risk related to its multicurrency revolving line of credit 
these interest rate swap agreements require the company to make payments to the counterparties at variable rates 
these interest rate swap agreements mature in august the variable rates are based on usd libor bba rates 
in november  the company entered into two three month interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of  these interest rate swap agreements require the company to make payments to the counterparties on february  at the three month usd libor bba rate as of november  less and receive monthly payments from the counterparties at the monthly usd libor bba rate 
at december and  the company paid a weighted average fixed rate of and  respectively and received a weighted average variable rate of and  respectively 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements  based on current market rates  approximated a net receivable of  and a net payable of  at december  and  respectively 
foreign exchange risk the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the company s significant foreign subsidiaries are located in germany  france  israel and the far east 
the company continues to reduce its exposure to foreign currencies by borrowing funds in local currency to balance its foreign assets and liabilities 
the company  in most locations  has introduced a netting policy where subsidiaries pay all intercompany balances within thirty days 
in september  a subsidiary of the company entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage the effect of exchange rate changes on certain foreign currency denominated transactions 
at december   the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts was  all of the total outstanding contracts at december  were to hedge yen denominated commitments from customers in japan 
in the normal course of business  the financial position of the company is routinely subjected to a variety of risks  including market risks associated with interest rate movements  currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities and collectibility of accounts receivable 
the company does not anticipate material losses in these areas
