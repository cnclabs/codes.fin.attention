net sales increased in to billion 
this compares to increases of in and in same store sales  consisting of sales from stores that have been open for more than one year  rose in  in and in pharmacy same store sales increased in and in and our pharmacy sales as a percentage of total net sales were in  in and in our third party prescription sales as a percentage of total pharmacy sales were in  in and in as you review our sales performance  we believe you should consider the following important information our pharmacy sales growth continued to benefit from our ability to attract and retain managed care customers  our ongoing program of purchasing prescription files from independent pharmacies and favorable industry trends 
these trends include an aging american population  many baby boomers are now in their fifties and are consuming a greater number of prescription drugs 
the increased use of pharmaceuticals as the first line of defense for healthcare and the introduction of a number of successful new prescription drugs also contributed to the growing demand for pharmacy services 
our front store sales growth was driven by strong performance in the health and beauty  photo  seasonal  and general merchandise categories 
the increase in net sales in was positively affected by the rd week 
excluding the positive impact of the rd week  net sales increased in when compared to the increase in net sales in was positively affected by our efforts to improve the performance of the revco stores 
to do this  we converted the retained revco stores to the cvs store format and relocated certain stores 
our performance during the conversion period was positively affected by temporary promotional events 
the increase in net sales in was positively affected by our acquisition of big b  inc  effective november  excluding the positive impact of the big b acquisition  net sales increased in when compared to please read note to the consolidated financial statements for other important information about the big b acquisition 
we continued to relocate our existing shopping center stores to larger  more convenient  freestanding locations 
historically  we have achieved significant improvements in customer count and net sales when we do this 
the resulting increase in net sales has typically been driven by an increase in front store sales  which normally have a higher gross margin 
we believe that our relocation program offers a significant opportunity for future growth  as only of our existing stores are freestanding 
we currently expect to have approximately of our stores in freestanding locations by the end of our long term goal is to have of our stores located in freestanding sites 
we cannot  however  guarantee that future store relocations will deliver the same results as those historically achieved 
please read the cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements section below 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in this compares to in and inventory shrinkage was of net sales in  compared to of net sales in and as you review our gross margin performance  please remember to consider the impact of the following nonrecurring charges during  we recorded a million charge to cost of goods sold to reflect markdowns on noncompatible arbor merchandise  which resulted from the cvs arbor merger transaction 
please read notes and to the consolidated financial statements for other important information about the cvs arbor merger 
during  we recorded a million charge to cost of goods sold to reflect markdowns on noncompatible revco merchandise  which resulted from the cvs revco merger transaction 
please read notes and to the consolidated financial statements for other important information about the cvs revco merger 
if you exclude the effect of these nonrecurring charges  our comparable gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in  in and in why has our comparable gross margin rate been declining pharmacy sales are growing at a faster pace than front store sales 
on average  our gross margin on pharmacy sales is lower than our gross margin on front store sales 
sales to customers covered by third party insurance programs have continued to increase and  thus  have become a larger part of our total pharmacy business 
our gross margin on third party sales has continued to decline largely due to the efforts of managed care organizations and other pharmacy benefit managers to reduce prescription drug costs 
to address this trend  we have dropped and or renegotiated a number of third party programs that fell below our minimum profitability standards 
in the event this trend continues and we elect to drop additional programs and or decide not to participate in future programs that fall below our minimum profitability standards  we may not be able to sustain our current rate of sales growth 
total operating expenses were of net sales in this compares to in and in as you review our performance in this area  please remember to consider the impact of the following nonrecurring charges during  we recorded a million charge to operating expenses for direct and other merger related costs pertaining to the cvs arbor merger transaction and related restructuring activities

if you exclude the effect of the nonrecurring charges we incurred in and  comparable operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were in  in and in what have we done to improve our comparable total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales our strong sales performance has consistently allowed our net sales to grow at a faster pace than total operating expenses 
our information technology initiatives have led to greater productivity  which has resulted in lower operating costs and improved sales 
we eliminated most of arbor s existing corporate overhead in and most of revco s in as a result of combining the operations of cvs  arbor and revco  we were able to achieve substantial annual operating cost savings in and although we are extremely proud of this accomplishment  we strongly advise you not to rely on the resulting operating expense improvement trend to predict our future performance 
operating profit increased million to billion in this compares to million in and million in if you exclude the effect of the nonrecurring charges we recorded in gross margin and in total operating expenses  our comparable operating profit increased million or to billion in this compares to million in and million in comparable operating profit as a percentage of net sales was in  in and in interest expense  net consisted of the following fiscal year in millions interest expense interest income interest expense  net the decrease in interest expense in was primarily due to the fact that we replaced million of our commercial paper borrowings with unsecured senior notes that bear a lower interest rate than our commercial paper 
the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels when compared to the decrease in interest income in was primarily due to interest income recognized during on a note receivable that we received when we sold kay bee toys in this note was sold in income tax provision our effective income tax rate was in compared to in and in our effective income tax rates were higher in and because certain components of the nonrecurring charges we recorded in conjunction with the cvs arbor and cvs revco merger transactions were not deductible for income tax purposes 
earnings from continuing operations before extraordinary item increased million to million or per diluted share in this compares to million or per diluted share in and million or per diluted share in if you exclude the effect of the nonrecurring charges we recorded in cost of goods sold and in total operating expenses  our comparable earnings from continuing operations before extraordinary item increased to million or per diluted share in this compares to million or per diluted share in and million or per diluted share in discontinued operations in november  we completed the final phase of a comprehensive strategic restructuring program  under which we sold marshalls  kay bee toys  wilsons  this end up and bob s stores 
as part of this program  we also completed the spin off of footstar  inc  which included meldisco  footaction and thom mcan  completed the initial and secondary public offerings of linens n things and eliminated certain corporate overhead costs 
during  we sold our remaining investment in linens n things and recorded  as a component of discontinued operations  an after tax gain of million 
in connection with recording this gain  we also recorded  as a component of discontinued operations  an after tax charge of million during to finalize our original liability estimates

net earnings were million or per diluted share in this compares to million or per diluted share in and million or per diluted share in liquidity capital resources liquidity the company has three primary sources of liquidity cash provided by operations  commercial paper and uncommitted lines of credit 
we generally finance our inventory and capital expenditure requirements with internally generated funds and commercial paper 
we currently expect to continue to utilize our commercial paper program to support our working capital needs 
in addition  we may elect to use long term borrowings in the future to support our continued growth 
our commercial paper program is supported by a million  five year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on may   and a million  day unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on june  we can also obtain up to million of short term financing through various uncommitted lines of credit 
as of january   we had million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the uncommitted lines of credit as of january  on february   we issued million of unsecured senior notes due february  the proceeds from the issuance were used to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings 
our credit facilities and unsecured senior notes contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants 
we do not believe that the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect our financial or operating flexibility 
capital resources although there can be no assurance and assuming market interest rates remain favorable  we currently believe that we will continue to have access to capital at attractive interest rates in we further believe that our cash on hand and cash provided by operations  together with our ability to obtain additional short term and long term financing  will be sufficient to cover our future working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
net cash provided by operations net cash provided by operations was million in this compares to net cash provided by operations of million in and net cash used in operations of million in the improvement in net cash provided by operations was primarily the result of higher net earnings  improved working capital management and a reduction in cash payments associated with the arbor and revco mergers

as of january   the future cash payments associated with these programs totaled million 
these payments primarily include i million for employee severance  which extends through  ii million for retirement benefits and related excess parachute payment excise taxes  which extend for a number of years to coincide with the future payment of retirement benefits  and iii million for continuing lease obligations  which extend through capital expenditures our capital expenditures totaled million in this compared to million in and million in during  we opened new stores  relocated existing stores and closed stores
