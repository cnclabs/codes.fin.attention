item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview excelon corporation is a leading provider of software products and services used for building and deploying bb software applications that enable companies to engage in dynamic bb commerce across the internet 
we have two major product lines our data server line of data management software products  and our recently expanded dynamic bb solutions product line for building bb applications 
our dynamic bb solutions product line encompasses our solutions for addressing the bb market our new core business 
our data server product line augments the dynamic bb solutions product line and represents the products we sell primarily into the telecommunications and embedded isv markets 
our products are marketed and sold worldwide through our direct sales force  systems integrators  independent software vendors  international distributors and other channel partners 
we expect to increase our sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses as we develop and expand our new dynamic bb solutions line of products and services 
because our bb products and services are in the early phase of market acceptance  we do not expect to generate sufficient bb revenues in to cover all such expenses 
accordingly  we expect to incur a loss in our revenues are derived from sales of licenses of our data server and dynamic bb solutions software  professional services  and maintenance 
our dynamic bb solutions product line was introduced in more than of our revenues were derived from our data server product line 
we generally license our software products on a perpetual basis 
license fees are generally billed upon shipment 
maintenance is generally billed annually in advance 
we offer our excelon esolutions and our implementation and other professional services primarily on a time and materials basis 
we offer training on a fixed fee basis 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position software revenue recognition 
revenue from software license fees is recognized when there is evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered  fees are fixed and determinable  and collection of the related receivable is deemed probable by management 
revenue from sales through distributors is recorded net of distributor commissions 
maintenance revenue  including those bundled with the initial license fee  are deferred and recognized ratably over the service period  generally one year 
consulting and training service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
our cost of software revenues includes primarily royalties to third parties for software used in our software 
our cost of services revenues primarily includes salaries and related expenses of our consulting and technical support personnel  and an allocation of overhead and recruitment costs 
the following table sets forth certain revenue and cost data as a percentage of our total revenues for each of the three years ended december  revenues software services related party software and services total revenues cost of revenues cost of software cost of services cost of related party software and services total cost of services gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring total operating expenses operating income loss other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss compared to software revenues 
software revenues decreased  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased volume of data server software licenses offset partially by an increase in sales of our new dynamic bb solutions product line 
we expect software license revenues from our dynamic bb solutions business to increase in future periods 
as we continue to place greater focus on our dynamic bb solutions product line  our data server software license revenues may stabilize or decline in future periods 
the timing of closing large sized software deals could result in fluctuations of future software license revenues in any quarter 
services revenues 
services revenues increased  to million in from million in the increase is due to higher demand for our consulting services related to customer deployments of our software and higher maintenance revenues  reflecting continued growth in our installed base of data server products 
we plan to hire additional consulting personnel during to accommodate projected additional growth for our consulting services 
as a result  we expect that our services revenues will grow in absolute dollars in future periods  but may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues 
related party revenues and cost of related party revenues 
related party revenues and associated cost of related party revenues were not material in in  related party revenues and associated cost of revenues were derived from services provided to ibm 
ibm ceased to be a related party in revenues from international operations 
revenues from the operations of our international subsidiaries decreased million in as compared to international revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in compared with in the decrease in dollar amount of our international revenues is approximately commensurate with the year over year decrease in our total revenues 
cost of software revenues 
cost of software revenues increased  to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of software revenues to from for such years  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of software revenues is due to additional purchases of technology from third parties in for inclusion in our new dynamic bb solutions product line  as well as the write off in of certain previously purchased technologies 
cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues increased  to million in from million in and decreased as a percentage of services revenues to from for such years  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount reflects the growth in staffing necessary to generate and support increased worldwide service revenues and provide customer support to our growing installed base 
the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of service revenues is primarily due to higher average utilization of consulting personnel in we expect cost of services revenues to continue to grow in absolute dollars  and it may increase as a percentage of services revenues in future periods as we invest in expanding our services organization in anticipation of future growth 
selling and marketing expense 
selling and marketing expense increased  to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of total revenues to from for such years  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues resulted primarily from the hiring of additional marketing personnel and increased spending on marketing programs to launch our new dynamic bb solutions product line 
we plan to expand our sales force and incur higher levels of marketing investments throughout the next year and  as a result  expect selling and marketing expense to continue to increase in future periods 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased  to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of total revenues to in from for the increase was due principally to the addition of personnel  depreciation of capital equipment and related overhead for the development of new dynamic bb solutions products and enhancement to existing data server products 
we expect research and development expense to increase in future periods as we continue to expand and enhance our dynamic bb solutions product line 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased  to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of total revenues to in compared to in the increase is reflective of the increased staffing  investments in information technology  professional expenses and other costs associated with our expanding operations 
we expect general and administrative expense to increase in future periods 
restructuring 
in  we recorded a restructuring charge in the amount of  in connection with repositioning the company for future growth 
the charge is composed of severance costs for eleven employees  closure costs of some office space  and cancellation costs of certain marketing initiatives 
other income 
other income increased  to million in from million in the increase was largely the result of overall higher cash balances as well as some movement to longer term investments that yield a higher rate of return 
provision for income taxes 
in  we paid only certain foreign income taxes due to our overall net loss 
our effective tax rate for was 
the effective tax rate in reflects an alternative minimum tax provision for federal taxes and certain state and foreign taxes 
the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate principally due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
compared to software revenues 
software revenues increased  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased volume of object database software licenses 
services revenues 
services revenues increased  to million in from million in the higher services revenue included increased consulting revenues relating to customer deployments and higher billable utilization of consulting personnel in  as well as increased maintenance revenues  reflecting growth in our installed base 
growing demand for our consulting services has led us to increase the number of our consulting personnel 
related party software and services revenues 
revenues from related parties decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the fact that a large software purchase by ibm in the first quarter of that was not repeated in and to the discontinuation in of a joint development project with ibm 
revenues from international operations 
revenues from the operations of our international subsidiaries increased million in as compared to and also increased as a percentage of our total revenues  to in compared with in the increase is due to increased volume of object database software licenses and is attributable to the expansion of our international direct sales force and increased services revenue reflecting growth in our international installed base 
cost of software revenues 
cost of software revenues increased  to million in from million in  and decreased as a percentage of software revenues to from for such years  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of software revenues reflect lower royalty costs in  due in part to a change in revenue mix toward sales of object database and other products that bear lower or no third party royalties 
cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues increased  to million in from million in and decreased as a percentage of services revenues to from for such years  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount reflects the growth in staffing necessary to generate and support increased worldwide service revenues and provide customer support to our growing installed base 
the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of service revenues is primarily due to higher average utilization of consulting personnel in cost of related party software and services revenues 
the cost of related party software and services revenues declined  to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of related party software and services revenues to from in such years  respectively 
the increased cost as a percentage of revenues was attributable to a shift in the mix of revenues in from higher margin software revenues to lower margin maintenance revenues 
selling and marketing expense 
selling and marketing expense increased  to million in from million in  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from for such years  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount resulted primarily from continued efforts to expand and retain our sales force and increased marketing investment  including increased expenditures on salaries  recruiting fees  marketing programs  travel and other related expenses  as well as higher sales commissions associated with higher revenues 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased  to million in from million in  but decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from for the expense increase was due principally to the addition of personnel  depreciation of capital equipment and related overhead for enhancements to existing products and the development of new products 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased  to million in from million in  but decreased as a percentage of total revenues to in compared to in the increase in dollar amount is reflective of the increased staffing  investments in information technology  professional expenses and other costs associated with our expanding operations 
other income 
other income decreased  to million in from million in the decrease was largely the result of lower rates of return on cash and investments 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate of and for and  respectively  reflects an alternative minimum tax provision for federal taxes and certain foreign and state taxes 
the effective tax rate in both years is lower than the statutory rate principally due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity included million of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  million of long term marketable securities  and a million revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank entered into in september availability under the line of credit is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable  subject to compliance with certain covenants 
borrowings are collateralized by our assets  excluding intellectual property  and bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding  and we were in compliance with the bank s covenants 
a letter of credit in the amount of  under the line of credit was outstanding at that date 
the line of credit expires in september  and we expect to renew the line of credit on terms similar to the existing agreement 
our operating activities provided net cash of million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily the result of a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in  offset in part by improved cash management and higher non cash depreciation and amortization expense 
our investing activities used net cash of million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease was attributable primarily to the net purchase of  of marketable securities in  compared to the net purchase of million of marketable securities in  and a decrease in purchased technology to million in from million in our financing activities provided net cash of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was due to an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises to million in from million in and the absence of repayment of shareholder advances in we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  bank line of credit and funds generated from operations  if any  will provide adequate liquidity to meet our capital and operating requirements for the next twelve months 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro  making the euro their common legal currency on that date 
the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the euro between january  and january  the transition period 
during the transition period  public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the participating country s legacy currency on a no compulsion  no prohibition basis 
however  conversion rates no longer will be computed directly from one legacy currency to another 
instead  a triangular process will apply whereby an amount denominated in one legacy currency will first be converted into the euro 
the resultant euro denominated amount will then be converted into the second legacy currency 
we have evaluated the business implications of conversion to the euro  including technical adaptation of information technology and other systems to accommodate euro denominated transactions  long term competitive implications of the conversions and the effect on market risk with respect to financial instruments and do not expect a material impact on our operations 
new accounting standards in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of the adoption of this new standard  however  it is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  which addresses software revenue recognition as it applies to certain multiple element arrangements 
sop also amends sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  to extend the deferral of application of certain provisions of sop through fiscal years beginning on or before march  all other provisions of sop are effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after march  we will comply with the requirements of this sop as they become effective and do not expect that our revenues and earnings will be materially affected 
on june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values 
changes in fair values of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  depending on the type of hedge transaction 
we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of the adoption of this new standard  however  it is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by us  statements made by our employees or information included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission may contain statements which are not historical facts but which are forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the words expect  anticipate  internal  plan  believe  seek  estimate and similar statements are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
in particular  statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to our future shipments  revenue and expense levels and profitability  as well as the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements  may be forward looking statements 
our disclosures in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  also constitute forward looking statements 
this report also contains other forward looking statements  including without limitation statements regarding the market opportunity for the dynamic bb software  our competitors  the stability of our data server business  the capabilities of our dynamic bb solutions product line  the adequacy of our existing facilities to meet our requirements over the next twelve months  adequate liquidity to meet our capital and operating requirements for the next twelve months 
such statements are not guarantees of future performance  but are based on assumptions and expectations of our management at the time such statements are made  and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements whether in response to new information  future events or otherwise 
the majority of our revenues to date have been derived from our data server line of object oriented products and related services 
future revenues from this product line will depend to a substantial degree on the emergence and widespread adoption of object oriented programming as a methodology for developing and deploying multi user business applications 
there can be no assurance that object oriented programming will become  and remain  an accepted methodology for developing and deploying enterprise wide business applications or that our object oriented database products and services will achieve or maintain market acceptance 
we expect to increase our sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses as we develop and expand our new dynamic bb solutions line of products and services 
because our bb products and services are in the early phase of market acceptance  we do not expect to generate sufficient bb revenues in to cover all such expenses 
accordingly  we expect to incur a loss in we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and bank line of credit will provide adequate liquidity to meet our capital and operating requirements for the next twelve months 
the time for which we believe our capital is sufficient is an estimate 
the actual time period may differ materially as a result of a number of factors  risks and uncertainties 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future through public or private debt or equity financing in order to develop new products or services  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or respond to competitive pressures 
additional financing we may need in the future may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of opportunities  develop new products or services or otherwise respond to unanticipated competitive pressures 
in such case  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
our new dynamic bb solutions product line is currently based in large part upon xml  or extensible markup language  an emerging standard for sharing data over the internet 
while we anticipate that xml will achieve broad market acceptance in the near future  it is possible that a competing standard perceived to be superior could replace xml  in which case the market may not accept an xml based product 
if a new standard were perceived to be superior  our software might not be compatible with the new standard or we might not be able to develop a product using this standard in a timely manner 
consequently  a failure of xml based products to achieve broad market acceptance or the introduction of a competing standard perceived to be superior in the market could harm our business 
the market for bb e commerce solutions is rapidly changing and intensely competitive 
we expect competition to intensify as the number of entrants and new technologies increases 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
the competitive pressures facing us may harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
our current and potential competitors include  among others  large software vendors  companies and trading networks that develop their own business to business integration e commerce solutions  vendors  vendors of proprietary enterprise application integration  or eai  solutions and application server vendors who have added xml capabilities to their products 
in addition  our customers and companies with whom we currently have strategic relationships may become competitors in the future 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have more experience developing internet based software  larger technical staffs  larger customer bases  more established distribution channels  greater brand recognition and greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
our competitors may be able to develop products and services that are superior to our software and services  that achieve greater customer acceptance or that have significantly improved functionality as compared to our existing software and future products and services 
in addition  negotiating and maintaining favorable customer and strategic relationships is critical to our business 
our competitors may be able to negotiate strategic relationships on more favorable terms than we are able to negotiate 
many of our competitors may also have well established relationships with our existing and prospective customers 
increased competition may result in reduced margins  loss of sales or decreased market share  which in turn could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend on product innovation and new product releases to remain competitive 
any delay in the release of products or failure of released products to meet the market expectation of functionality and features could undermine our competitive position 
furthermore  certain of our competitors are significantly larger and are expending greater amounts on research and development and sales and marketing than we are 
the result could be new competitive product introductions that could limit the salability of our products or put pressure on sales prices 
our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
we assume that we will continue to be able to attract and retain such personnel 
while we have not experienced any significant difficulty in hiring qualified personnel to date  competition for such personnel in the high technology industry is intense 
we experience attrition  and this cannot be predicted 
the failure to recruit and retain qualified personnel  however  could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
our software is complex and may contain known and undetected errors or performance problems 
many serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction of new software or enhancements to existing software 
although we attempt to resolve all errors that we believe would be considered serious by our customers  our software is not error free 
undetected errors or performance problems may be discovered in the future 
our customers may perceive such errors to be serious 
this could result in lost revenue or delays in customer acceptance and would be detrimental to our reputation  which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
because of the complexity of our software  internal quality assurance testing and customer testing may reveal product performance issues or desirable feature enhancements that could lead us to postpone the release of new versions of our software 
in addition  the reallocation of resources associated with any postponement could cause delays in the development and release of future enhancements to our currently available software 
we may not be able to successfully complete the development of future enhancements in a timely and efficient manner 
any such failure or delay could harm our operating results 
our market is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product announcements 
to be successful  we must adapt to our rapidly changing market by continually improving the performance  features and reliability of our software and services 
we could incur substantial costs to modify our software  services or infrastructure in order to adapt to these changes 
our business could be harmed if we incur significant costs without adequate results  or if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these changes 
the market for internet based  business to business integration software is relatively new and is evolving rapidly 
our future revenues and any future profits depend upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet as an effective medium for business to business commerce 
the failure of the internet to continue to develop as a commercial or business medium could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
the acceptance and use of the internet for business to business commerce could be limited by a number of factors  such as the growth and use of the internet in general  the relative ease of conducting business on the internet  the efficiencies and improvements that conducting commerce on the internet provides  concerns about transaction security and taxation of transactions on the internet 
we typically receive the majority of our revenue in the last month of each quarter with a concentration of revenue in the latter half of such month 
this pattern  common to many software companies  makes it difficult to forecast accurately  increasing the possibility of missing a quarterly revenue or profit target 
any inability to obtain orders in large volume or to make shipments in the period immediately preceding the end of any particular quarter may cause the results for that quarter to fall short of our revenue targets 
any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales by our international subsidiaries and to distributors outside the united states 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile 
in particular  the market price of our stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations and may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our company s performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to certain market risks  primarily adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we have not invested in derivative instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we believe that the fair value of other financial instruments reflected in our consolidated balance sheets does not represent a significant market risk due to the nature of these instruments and their short term maturities 
we also do not believe that our future earnings  fair values and or cash flows are subject to risk of material near term loss due to changes in market rates or prices that we consider to be reasonably possible in the near term 
however  our exposure to market risk may change over time as our business practices evolve  and could in the future materially adversely effect our financial condition and results of operations 
our primary exposure has been related to local currency revenue and operating expenses in europe and the asia pacific region 
financial risk management the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value at the balance sheet date due to the short maturities of these instruments 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
information about our investment portfolio is set forth in note c of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k and is incorporated herein by reference 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses included in stockholders equity 
to date  we have not experienced material losses on our investments 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at december   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk fluctuations in exchange rates can adversely effect our results of operations and financial position 
the financial statements of our international subsidiaries  all of whose functional currencies are the local currency  are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the period for results of operations 
foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  and also are included in reporting comprehensive income 
we also engage in transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
gains and losses from these transactions  which to date have been immaterial  are reflected in the results of operations 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations and financial condition cannot accurately be predicted 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging activities
