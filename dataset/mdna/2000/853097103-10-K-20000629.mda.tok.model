overview as part of our business strategy  we seek to grow through expansion of facilities  extension of product lines and acquisitions 
our continued expansion may place a strain on management  operational  financial and other resources 
our expansion plans will depend on our ability to identify appropriate targets for acquisitions and to raise the necessary capital for new acquisitions 
further  the success of our efforts will depend on our ability to market new products  absorb new management and other personnel  reduce duplicative overhead and manage geographically dispersed operations

the mexican facility represented of total fiscal revenue while r s  cps and ranor contributed  and  respectively 
cost of revenues for fiscal increased to  or of net revenues  from  or of net revenues in fiscal cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased slightly during fiscal  as a more favorable cost mix associated with the products of r s  cps and ranor was offset by the start up expenses resulting in lower margins at our mexican facility 
selling  general administrative expenses were  during fiscal  an increase of from the  incurred during fiscal sg a expenses were of sales for each of the periods 
during fiscal  standard experienced higher corporate oversight expenses which were offset by generally more favorable sales to expense ratios at our manufacturing locations 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  during fiscal  reflecting debt incurred in pursuing our acquisition and internal growth strategies 
comparison of year ended march  to year ended march  net revenues in fiscal were  an increase of from net revenues of  for fiscal the increase in net revenues reflects a shift of our business to the manufacture of new chassis from the re manufacture of used chassis  a general improvement in the trailer industry  and the acquisitions of r s and cps each with revenues representing and  respectively of net revenues 
during fiscal  sales of new chassis represented of total sales as compared to in fiscal although the comparative percentage decreased due to the additional revenue from the acquisitions  the volume of new chassis sold approximately doubled in fiscal compared to fiscal in contrast  sales of re manufactured chassis represented of total sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the reduction in the sales of re manufactured chassis resulted from a decline in the growth of re manufactured chassis sold in fiscal as compared to the aforementioned growth of the sale of new chassis 
because of certain customer requirements related to new chassis  our margins declined moderately in fiscal cost of revenues increased to  or of net revenues in fiscal from  or of net revenues in fiscal  principally as a result of the acquisitions of r s and cps and the shift in our product mix

the net cash used in investing activities was  during fiscal as compared to  used in investing activities during the prior year 
the cash used in investing activities during fiscal was primarily for the acquisition of ranor and for the acquisition of other property  plant and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was predominately from the increase in the company s credit facility  which was used for the acquisition of ranor 
standard also repaid  of bank debt and made  of preferred stock dividend payments during fiscal additionally  the prior owners of r s exercised their put agreement requiring standard to purchase  of company common stock which was retired to treasury 
standard also incurred additional financing costs relating to the acquisition of ranor 
the funding for the ranor acquisition was obtained by increasing from  to  the amount outstanding under standard s credit facility 
this credit facility  as amended  provides for a term loan in the amount of  and a revolving loan in the principal amount of  collectively  the loans 
the principal of the term loan is payable in two installments of  and  in june and june  respectively 
amounts outstanding under the revolving loan are payable in full in june  subject to the company s request  with the approval of the lenders  to extend the due date for one year  with a maximum extension of two one year periods 
all amounts due under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all the company s assets 
as of march  the rate of interest for the amounts outstanding under the credit facility was 
the company made scheduled quarterly principal payments of  in march of   in december of   in september of and  in june of in april  we acquired airborne and arell 
the funding to complete the acquisitions was obtained through increasing our existing credit facility of  to  of senior secured credit facilities senior secured credit facilities  comprised of a million revolving credit facility revolver  a million six year term loan term loan a  a million seven year term loan term loan b and a million acquisition line acquisition line  which is available upon the fulfillment of certain conditions precedent 
ing barings llc and pnc capital markets pnc arranged this financing 
in addition to financing the acquisitions of arell and airborne  the senior secured credit facilities are being used to finance capital expenditures  to provide additional working capital and to provide the company with financing for future acquisitions 
the terms on which we sell our products vary by operating company but generally provide for payment within days 
our accounts receivable were collected in an average of days during the fiscal year ended march  during fiscal  r s began to offer extended term sales to its dealers 
the outstanding receivables on extended term sales as of march  were capital expenditures were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal capital expenditures incurred during fiscal were primarily for the purchase of new machinery for expanding the production capacity at ranor and for equipment purchased for the recently established chassis manufacturing facility in mexico 
we anticipate that capital expenditures during the fiscal year ending march  will not substantially exceed those of the preceding years 
the annual dividend requirement on our preferred stock at march  is  our future earnings  if any  may not be adequate to cover dividends on the preferred stock 
although we fully intend to pay these quarterly dividends out of available capital surplus  we cannot assure you that we will maintain sufficient capital surplus or that future earnings  if any  will be adequate to fulfill preferred stock dividend obligations 
in addition  at march   we had  in total debt outstanding  consisting of an outstanding revolving loan line of  a term loan of  and a note to the prior owners of ranor of  other debt is  we continue to seek opportunities for growth through acquisitions 
accordingly  we may seek to raise additional cash in the form of equity  bank debt or other debt financing  or else it may seek to issue either common or preferred stock as consideration for its acquisition targets 
at march   we had working capital of  which management believes is sufficient to meet current operating requirements 
if necessary  such needs could be supplemented by funds provided by the revolver 
significant events in june  pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement dated april  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of critical components corporation ccc 
in consideration for such capital stock we issued to the shareholders of ccc an aggregate of  shares of common stock of the company 
simultaneously with the acquisition of ccc  the company  through ccc  acquired substantially all of the assets of ranor  inc ranor  a fabricator of large precision assemblies for the aerospace  nuclear  industrial and military markets 
the consideration paid for ranor was  subject to final adjustment  of which  was paid in cash and  was paid in the form of convertible subordinated notes of the company 
in addition  we incurred approximately  of acquisition related expenses pertaining to the purchase and financing of ranor 
in april  standard  through its newly established canadian subsidiary  critical components canada ltd  acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of airborne and arell 
we believe that the acquisitions of airborne and arell further diversify standard s operations and should significantly expand our manufacturing capability of high precision parts and assemblies for use primarily in the aerospace industry 
we acquired airborne and arell for an aggregate purchase price of  subject to final adjustment and potential earnouts estimated to be  based on defined ebitda hurdles 
we incurred approximately  of additional acquisition costs related to the purchase and financing of airborne and arell

item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions concerning market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowings under the credit facility 
as of june   we had approximately  of prime based debt outstanding under the credit facility 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the floating interest rate from the current level corresponds to an increase in our interest expense over a one year period of  this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in our competitive environment indirectly related to the change in interest rates and the potential managerial action which could be taken in response to these changes 
further  on april  we entered into an interest rate hedge with a notional amount of  to protect against interest rate increases 
as of april  we commenced production at our facility in sonora  mexico 
accordingly  fluctuation in the value of the mexican peso compared to the us dollar upon currency conversion may affect our financial position and cash flow 
as of march   we had not established a foreign currency hedging program 
because a majority of our transactions are us based and us dollar denominated  a hypothetical change in the value of the mexican peso would not have a material impact on our financial position and cash flow
