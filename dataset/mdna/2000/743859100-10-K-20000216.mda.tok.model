these variances are discussed in more detail beginning on the following pages 
results of operations net interest income the corporation s principal source of revenue is net interest income  the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
interest income  for purposes of analysis  is presented on a tax equivalent basis to recognize associated tax benefits 
this presentation provides a basis for comparison of yields with taxable earning assets 
the discussion on net interest income should be read in conjunction with table analysis of changes in net interest income and table consolidated average balances  interest income and expense and yields and rates 
tax equivalent net interest income for increased million  or  from as average earning assets grew million over the prior year 
net interest margin increased slightly to compared to in provident s tax equivalent interest income increased million  or  during the year primarily due to the growth in average earning assets offset in part by a basis point decrease in yield 
the decrease in yield was mainly due to a lower interest rate environment during compared to average prime rate in was compared to in the increase in average earning assets resulted from a million increase in the loan portfolios  million in investments and million in loans held for sale

the higher earnings are principally due to an increase in net interest income 
lower non interest income resulting from net security gains in and a rise in operating expenses partially offset the increase in income 
tax equivalent net interest income in the fourth quarter rose or million to million as the net interest margin grew to from and average earning assets grew million to billion

financial condition source and use of funds deposits a major portion of provident s funding comes from core deposits  which consist of consumer and commercial transaction accounts and consumer savings and time deposits 
these deposits are generated through the bank s branch banking locations 
at december   core deposits represented of total deposits and of total liabilities 
provident s future funding growth is expected to be generated from deposit growth through strategies outlined below 
the branch network strategy includes traditional full service branch locations and in store branches 
in store branch locations are comprised of supermarket locations and national retail superstores 
provident bank as of december  had traditional branch locations and in store branches 
the corporation has an agreement with rich food corporation to operate branches in their metro and basic supermarkets in the baltimore metropolitan area and shoppers food warehouse in the washington  dc metropolitan area 
provident will selectively look for additional branch opportunities complementary to existing locations when the cost of entry is reasonable 
the corporation has ten additional in store branches and three new traditional branches planned for provident continues to attract increased commercial and retail deposits 
interest bearing demand money market deposit balances at december  were up million  or  compared to year end the bank also operates eight fast n friendly check cashing centers 
the purpose of the check cashing centers is to offer alternative banking services to a segment of our market place that does not utilize traditional banking services 
the corporation has two new centers planned for the table below presents the average deposit balances and rates paid for the five years ended december  average deposits table average average average average average average average average average average dollars in thousands balance rate balance rate balance rate balance rate balance rate noninterest bearing      money market demand      savings      time certificates of deposit      individual retirement accounts      total average balance rate      total year end balance      as the table above indicates  provident has a stable base of consumer savings deposits 
during  average deposits grew million  or  compared to average money market demand deposits and non interest bearing deposits increased million or 
this growth reflects provident s emphasis on full banking relationships with its retail and commercial customers 
average time deposits increased million  or  million of which is attributable to brokered deposits and million in money market certificates of deposit 
brokered deposits  often a cheaper source of funds compared to other available sources of borrowed money  such as  federal home loan bank advances and repurchase agreements are used to match fund investments and acquired loans 
the table below presents information at december   with respect to the maturity of certificates of deposit of  or more 
deposit maturities table maturities over three over six three months months to months to over dollars in thousands or less six months months months total balance      percent of total credit risk management much of the fundamental business of provident is based upon understanding  measuring and controlling credit risk 
credit risk entails both general risks  which is inherent in the process of lending  and risk specific to individual borrowers 
each consumer and residential lending product has a generally predictable level of credit loss 
for example  loans with generally low credit loss experience include home mortgage and home equity loans 
loans with medium credit loss experience are primarily secured products such as auto and marine loans 
the category with high credit loss experience includes unsecured products such as personal revolving credit 
in commercial lending  losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can vary widely from period to period and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions 
the evaluation of specific risk is a basic function of underwriting and loan administration  involving analysis of the borrower s ability to service debt as well as the value of pledged collateral 
policies and procedures have been developed which specify the appropriate credit approval and monitoring for the various types of credit offered 
the bank employs prudent lending practices and adheres to regulatory requirements including loan to value ratios and legal lending limits 
these procedures are modified periodically in order to reflect changing conditions and new products 
the bank s lending and loan administration staffs are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio  identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower s circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral 
in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio  credit risk identification and review processes are utilized 
credit risk analysis assigns a grade to each commercial loan based upon an assessment of the borrower s financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan 
an independent loan review function tests risk assessment and determines the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
financial accounting standards require creditors to evaluate the collectibility of contractually due principal and interest on commercial credits to assess the need for providing for losses 
the corporation s credit procedures require monitoring of commercial credits to determine the collectibility of such credits 
if a loan is identified as impaired  it will be placed on non accrual status and recorded according to accounting guidelines 
as of december   there were million in commercial loans considered to be impaired 
loans provident offers a diversified mix of residential and commercial real estate  business and consumer loans 
as shown in table  the mix of loans outstanding has shifted to more consumer orientation over the past five years 
of the total loans  billion  or  are secured by residential real estate including first and second mortgages  and home equity loans 
provident s residential mortgage lending includes the origination  sale and servicing of fixed and variable rate mortgage loans 
loans are originated through the loan production offices of provident mortgage corp 
financial accounting standards for mortgage banking enterprises that acquire mortgage servicing rights  and sell or securitize those loans with servicing retained  require the allocation of the cost of the mortgage loans to the mortgage servicing rights and the loans 
mortgage origination activity in showed a significant decrease as originations totaled million in compared to billion in during  income from the sale of loans was million 
the mortgage servicing portfolio ended the year at million 
the residential real estate mortgage loan balance at december  was million compared to million at the end of the prior year

in addition  the bank may purchase portfolios of quality consumer loans from other financial institutions 
all purchased portfolios go through a thorough due diligence process prior to a purchase commitment 
provident s portfolio of acquired loans increased million on average  ending the year at billion  and is predominately comprised of second mortgages 
consumer loan balances through credits originated by provident remained relatively flat during the year  ending the year with a balance of million 
during  the bank made a decision to cut back on the production of both indirect auto and residential mortgage loans to concentrate on more profitable businesses 
most of the automobile loans are made through a network of auto dealerships in maryland  delaware  pennsylvania and virginia 
auto loans made through this network of dealerships ended the year at million 
marine loan balances ended with million  and were produced primarily through correspondent brokers 
home equity lines of credit totaled million at the end of while direct second mortgage loans ended the year at million 
provident s focus in commercial real estate lending has been on financing commercial and residential construction  as well as on intermediate term commercial mortgages 
properties securing the loans include office buildings  shopping centers  apartment complexes  warehouses  residential building lots and developments 
average commercial real estate mortgage loans decreased million or while average commercial construction loans increased million or 
average residential construction loans decreased million or to end the year at million 
provident s commercial loan portfolio consists of general business loans  including asset based loans  primarily to small and medium sized businesses in the baltimore  maryland and washington  dc metropolitan areas 
the bank stresses the importance of asset quality as well as the development of new marketing programs 
average commercial loans grew by million  or  ending the year at million 
provident has minimal exposure to highly leveraged transactions hlts 
hlts are loans to borrowers for the purpose of purchasing or recapitalizing a business in which the loans represent a majority of the borrower s liabilities 
hlts totaled million as of year end  and all are performing in accordance with their contractual terms 
non performing assets and past due loans non performing assets include loans on which interest is no longer accrued  renegotiated loans and real estate and other assets that have been acquired through foreclosure or repossession 
past due loans are loans that are days or more past due as of december and still accruing interest because they are well secured and in the process of collection 
the corporation does not place consumer loans on non accrual status as delinquent consumer loan outstandings and any uncollected interest are generally charged off at the time they would be placed on non accrual status 
information with respect to non performing assets and past due loans is presented in table for the years indicated 
as shown in the table  total non accrual loans increased million  mainly in commercial business 
this increase is due to one health care relationship  the largest portion of million is part of a shared national credit 
the total relationship is million 
the financial condition of the health care industry has weakened over the past year 
provident has been closely monitoring these and several other of the bank s health care industry credits where the operators have had to adjust to changes in medicare reimbursement policies 
the entire health care portfolio  including the credits added to non performing loans  represents of provident s total loans 
the increase in past due consumer loans is a result of a million  or  growth in the consumer loan portfolio  the majority of which is secured by residential real estate 
as of december   non performing assets and past due loans ended the year at million and million  respectively 
see the discussion under loans on page the million in past due residential mortgage loans are guaranteed or insured by an agency of the united states government and no significant loss is anticipated

prior to  consumer loans were generally placed into non accrual status at days past due and subsequently charged off 
beginning in  to conform to standard industry practice  consumer loans are not placed in non accrual status but are generally charged off at days past due for installment loans and days for revolving loans 
allowance for loan losses provident maintains an allowance for loan losses  which is available to absorb potential losses 
the allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses 
determination of the adequacy of the allowance  which is performed quarterly  is accomplished by assigning specific reserves to individually identified problem credits and general reserves  based on historic and anticipated loss experience  to all other loans 
management believes that the allowance at december  will be adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
management believes that is uses the best information available to make such determinations 
if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be affected 
while the bank believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with gaap  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the bank s loan portfolio  will not request the bank to increase significantly its allowance for loan losses 
because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases to the allowance will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
the following table reflects the allowance for possible loan losses and the activity during each of the respective years

allowance for loan losses to year end loans the continued emphasis on loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits has resulted in a strong credit portfolio 
senior managers meet at least monthly to review the credit quality of the loan portfolios and at least quarterly with executive management to review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is determined by management s evaluation of the composition and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
based upon the evaluation of credit risk  loan loss provisions in the form of charges to operations  are made to bring the allowance up to a level management believes is adequate 
an analysis of the loan portfolio was performed at december   and expected losses have been provided for in the allowance for loan losses 
during  the loan loss allowance decreased million to million at year end 
this decrease is related to the pay out of an adverse decision in a lawsuit associated with a letter of credit issued in this pay out was provided for in the allowance as a percentage of total loans was at december  compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non accrual loans was at december   compared to the prior year 
the portion of the allowance  which is allocated to non accrual loans  is determined by estimating the potential loss on each credit after giving consideration to the value of underlying collateral 
provident maintains a loan classification and review system to identify those loans with a higher than normal risk of uncollectibility 
estimated potential losses from internally criticized loans have been provided for in determining the allowance for loan losses

the investment securities portfolio includes mortgage backed securities  us government securities  municipal securities and other debt securities 
in addition to investment securities  the corporation invests in federal funds sold  reverse repos  mortgage loans held for sale and other short term investments referred to in total as the investment portfolio 
the strategies employed in the management of these portfolios depend upon the liquidity  interest sensitivity and capital objectives and requirements of the corporation 
the treasury division executes these strategies

management s principal objectives for the investment portfolio during were to maintain an appropriate level of quality  to ensure sufficient liquidity in various interest rate environments while maximizing yield and to increase net income by utilizing excess capital 
to successfully achieve these objectives  the corporation employs off balance sheet and on balance sheet strategies 
total investment securities increased million during as a result of securitizing million of purchased consumer loans during the fourth quarter of the corporation applies the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
which requires investment securities to be segregated into three categories held to maturity  trading  and available for sale 
all securities in the available for sale category must be measured at fair market value 
the resulting gain or loss is excluded from revenue but is reflected as a change in stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
trading securities must be measured at fair value and changes included in income for the period 
as of december   the corporation had no investments classified as trading securities 
securities designated as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
subsequent to the acquisition of first citizens financial corporation in  provident disposed of certain securities classified as held to maturity by first citizens financial corporation 
as a result of these transactions  all of the corporation s investment securities have been classified as available for sale 
additionally  all future purchases of securities will be classified as available for sale in the foreseeable future 
at december   the available for sale portfolio included net unrealized losses of approximately million  compared to net unrealized gains of million at december  in addition to unrealized gains and losses  provident realized thousand in gains and thousand in losses from the sale of securities from the available for sale portfolio in these sales were the result of management s continuous monitoring of the investment securities portfolio in terms of both performance and risks 
liquidity and sensitivity to interest rates liquidity an important component of the bank s asset liability structure is the level of liquidity available to meet the needs of customers and creditors 
traditional sources of bank liquidity include deposit growth  loan repayments  investment maturities  asset sales  borrowings and interest received 
provident s asset liability management committee has established general guidelines for the maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity 
the committee continually monitors the amount and source of available liquidity  the time required to obtain it and its cost 
management believes the bank has sufficient liquidity to meet funding needs in the foreseeable future 
primary sources of liquidity at december  were loans held for sale  investment securities available for sale  and scheduled loan repayments 
loans held for sale and investment securities available for sale totaled billion 
this represents of total liabilities compared to at december  maturities of investment securities  as table indicates  is expected to generate million in funds in and million  or  of the portfolio within the next five years

at year end  core deposits represented billion  or  of total liabilities and of total assets 
an important element in liquidity management is the availability of borrowed funds 
at december   short term borrowings totaled million  or  of liabilities in contrast to million  or  of liabilities at december  another key element in liquidity management is the use of brokered cds 
brokered cds at december  amounted to billion  a million increase from the same period last year 
the average maturity of short term borrowings at the end of the current year was days 
these borrowings are fully collateralized by us government or mortgage backed securities owned by the bank 
long term borrowings consisted of variable and fixed rate advances from the federal home loan bank and totaled million as of december  it is anticipated that provident will continue to have access to the repurchase market and fed fund lines as well as short and long term variable and fixed rate funds from the federal home loan bank 
during the second quarter of  the corporation issued million of trust preferred securities with a maturity of years  callable at the end of the tenth year 
the rate on the trust preferred securities is 
interest sensitivity management the nature of the banking business  which involves paying interest on deposits at varying rates and terms and charging interest on loans at other rates and terms  creates interest rate risk 
as a result  earnings are subject to fluctuations  which arise due to changes in the level and directions of interest rates 
management s objective is to minimize this risk 
measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that is performed regularly as an important component of management s analysis of the impact of changes in asset and liability portfolios 
control of provident s interest sensitivity position is accomplished through the structuring of the investment and funding portfolios  securitizing loans for possible sale  the use of variable rate loan products and off balance sheet derivatives 
management does not try to anticipate changes in interest rates 
its principal objective is to maintain interest margins in periods of both rising and falling rates 
traditional interest sensitivity gap analyses alone do not adequately measure an institution s exposure to changes in interest rates because gap models are not sensitive to changes in the relationship between interest rates charged or paid and do not incorporate balance sheet trends and management actions 
each of these factors can affect an institution s earnings 
accordingly  in addition to performing gap analysis  management also evaluates the impact of differing interest rates on net interest income using an earnings simulation model 
the model incorporates the factors not captured by gap analysis by projecting income over a twenty four month horizon under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
as of december   provident s interest sensitive liabilities exceeded interest sensitive assets within a one year period by billion  or of assets 
the bank s savings products are structured to give management the ability to reset the rates paid on a monthly basis 
this causes the bank to become more liability sensitive 
if interest rates rise  the rate paid on savings deposits may follow  and the corporation s net interest margin may decline 
management continues to take steps to protect the bank from possible increases in interest rates 
in  these steps included lengthening the maturities on purchased funds and certificates of deposits and shortening asset maturities with interest rate swaps and caps 
management monitors the interest rate environment and employs appropriate off balance sheet strategies to address potential changes in interest rates 
these strategies lower the net interest margin but are designed to maintain an acceptable margin in a changing rate environment 
as a result of off balance sheet transactions undertaken to insulate the bank from interest rate risks  interest income decreased by thousand and interest expense increased by million  for a total decrease of million in net interest income for the year ending december  included in this net interest income increase was the amortization of closed positions which reduced interest income by thousand and decreased interest expense by million a net increase of million for the year 
without the amortization of closed positions  off balance sheet positions decreased net interest income million for the year 
as of december   the forward markets indicated that short term rates will increase by basis points and long term rates will increase by basis points over the next twelve months 
the corporation s analysis indicates that if management does not adjust its december  off balance sheet positions and the forward yield curve assumptions occur  off balance sheet positions  including amortization of closed positions  would decrease net interest income by million over the next twelve months 
however  yields on associated on balance sheet hedged assets would improve by a corresponding amount 
this compares to a decrease of million should interest rates remain unchanged 
amortization of closed positions will increase net interest income by million over the next twelve months 
thus  without amortization of closed positions  net interest income would decrease million over the next twelve months if the forward yield curve assumptions occur and million if rates remain unchanged 
stockholders equity it is necessary for banks to maintain a sufficient level of capital in order to sustain growth  absorb unforeseen losses and meet regulatory requirements 
in addition  the current economic and regulatory climate places an increased emphasis on capital strength 
in this environment  provident continues to maintain a strong capital position 
provident is well capitalized  exceeding all regulatory requirements as of december   see note regulatory capital 
at december   total stockholders equity was million  a million decrease over the prior year 
in addition to the ordinary adjustments to stockholders equity of net income and dividends paid  additional capital of thousand was raised through the dividend reinvestment plan  million from the exercise of stock options  while capital decreased by million during as a result of statement of financial accounting standards no 
this statement requires changes in market value  net of applicable income taxes  of the available for sale investment portfolio to be accounted for through equity 
an additional component of regulatory capital is the capital securities issued in these securities are treated as tier i capital even though they are not included in stockholders equity in the consolidated statement of condition 
during  the corporation also repurchased  shares totaling million 
in the second quarter of  the corporation issued a stock dividend and all earnings per share figures have been adjusted for this dividend 
provident exceeds all regulatory capital requirements as of december  the standards used by federal bank regulators to evaluate capital adequacy are the risk based capital and leverage ratio guidelines 
equity for regulatory purposes does not include market value adjustments as required by sfas no 
risk based capital ratios measure core and total stockholders equity against risk weighted assets 
provident s core capital is equal to its common stock  capital surplus and retained earnings less treasury stock 
the calculation of provident s total stockholders equity  for these purposes  is equal to the above plus the allowance for loan losses subject to certain limitations and capital securities 
risk weighted assets are determined by applying a weighting to asset categories and certain off balance sheet commitments based on the level of credit risk inherent in the assets 
at december   provident s total capital ratio was compared to the minimum regulatory guideline of 
in addition  core common stockholders equity tier capital must be at least of risk weighted assets 
at year end  provident s tier capital ratio was the leverage ratio represents core capital  as defined above  divided by average total assets 
guidelines for the leverage ratio require the ratio of core stockholders equity to average total assets to be to basis points above a minimum  depending on risk profiles and other factors 
provident s leverage ratio of at december  was well in excess of this requirement 
capital components and ratios table december  dollars in thousands qualifying capital tier capital   total capital   risk weighted assets   quarterly average assets   ratios leverage capital tier capital total capital financial review the corporation recorded net income in of million or per share diluted  a increase over before adjusting for merger related costs 
adjusting for merger costs  would have shown net income of million and per share diluted  giving an increase of million in net income and 
per share diluted over the prior year 
the growth in net earnings was attributable to an million rise in net interest income and million higher non interest income offset in part by higher provision for loan losses of million and a million increase in operating costs  net of merger expenses 
tax equivalent net interest income for increased million  or  from as average earning assets grew million over the prior year 
net interest margin fell by basis points primarily caused by a lower interest rate environment and leveraging of million of trust preferred securities issued during the second quarter of provident s interest income increased million  or  during the year primarily due to the growth in average earning assets offset in part by a basis point decrease in yield 
the decrease in yield was mainly due to a lower rate environment and the leveraging of the trust preferred securities noted above 
the increase in average earning assets resulted from a million increase in the loan portfolios  million in investments and million in loans held for sale 
consumer loans grew million while the commercial business portfolio also experienced growth of million

the overall cost of funds remained relatively flat as total interest bearing liabilities increased basis points mainly due to the use of brokered cds to fund asset growth 
the offset was due to the increase in non interest bearing liabilities 
excluding the effect of off balance sheet positions in each year  total costs of interest bearing liabilities would have increased basis points 
the average rate paid on borrowed funds decreased basis points during the increase in average interest bearing liabilities reflects a million rise in interest bearing deposits  million of which is associated with brokered deposits and million with money market certificates of deposit 
non interest bearing demand deposit accounts grew by million or

income from mortgage banking activities rose million  million due to higher gains and million from higher origination income offset in part by thousand in lower servicing income 
income associated with sales of annuities and mutual funds increased by thousand to million 
other non interest income increased million over this increase was primarily due to commercial loan fees tied to an increase in loan volumes and higher prepayment penalties
