results of operations overview we use a proprietary vgf technique to produce high performance compound semiconductor substrates for use in a variety of electronic and opto electronic applications 
we were founded in and commenced substrate sales in we currently sell gaas  inp and gan substrates to manufacturers of semiconductor devices for use in applications such as wireless and fiber optic telecommunications  lasers  leds  and consumer electronics 
we also sell ge substrates for use in satellite solar cells 
on may   we completed our acquisition of lyte optronics  inc  a nevada corporation  with operations in southern california and the people s republic of china 
lyte optronics is a manufacturer of led s and laser diodes 
lyte optronics also designs and markets laser pointing and alignment products for the consumer  commercial and industrial markets 
lyte optronics is operated as two separate divisions of axt the visible emitter division  focusing on the manufacture of led s and laser diodes  and the consumer products division  focusing on the design and marketing of laser pointing and alignment products 
of the approximately employees of lyte optronics retained after the acquisition about are with the visible emitter division  with about employees located in china 
under the terms of the acquisition  we issued approximately  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock with a million liquidation preference over common stock  in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of lyte optronics 
ten percent of the shares issuable to the lyte optronics shareholders will be held in escrow for up to one year to satisfy any claims that we may bring under the agreement during that period 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in connection with the acquisition  we reported a charge of million in the second quarter of to reflect transaction costs and other one time charges incurred in connection with the acquisition 
we have been profitable on an annual basis since our total revenues were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  total revenues primarily consist of product revenues 
product revenues are generally recognized upon shipment of products to customers 
historically  a significant portion of our product revenues have been derived from sales of gaas substrates and laser pointing and alignment products 
in the years ended december   gaas substrates accounted for  in and in of our total revenues and laser pointing and alignment products accounted for  and  respectively 
since october  we have included the sales of products from our visible emitter division in our financial results 
in  sales from our visible emitter division generated of total revenues 
we began selling inp and ge substrates to our customers in late  gan substrates in late and in late we began selling led s to our customers 
historically  revenues generated from research and development contracts with us government agencies and customer funded research projects comprised more than of our total revenues 
we expect our contract revenue to decline to less than of our total revenues in future periods as a result of our shift to internally generated research and development projects from government and customer funded contracts 
in  we established a wholly owned subsidiary in japan to distribute our products 
this subsidiary serves primarily as a direct sales and support office for our customers in japan 
we also utilize independent sales representatives in france  japan  south korea  taiwan and the united kingdom 
domestic sales are generated by our direct sales force 
international sales  excluding canada  accounted for of total revenues for the year ended december   in  and in except for sales in japan and some sales in taiwan  which are denominated in yen  we denominate and collect our international sales in us dollars 
doing business in japan subjects us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
during the year ended december   we incurred foreign transaction exchange loss of  a loss of  in  and a gain of  in during the year ended december   we bought foreign exchange contracts to hedge against certain trade accounts receivable in japanese yen 
the outstanding commitments with respect to such foreign exchange contracts had a total value of approximately million as of december  from july to october  we conducted all of our substrate operations in a  square foot office and production facility located in fremont  california 
prior to transitioning our manufacturing operations to this facility  we leased a  square foot manufacturing facility in dublin  california 
in late  we expanded the size of our current manufacturing facility by approximately  square feet to meet our anticipated future production needs through in june  we purchased an additional  square foot facility in fremont  california directly across the street from our existing manufacturing facility and moved marketing  sales  engineering and administrative personnel into a portion of the building 
we believe that this new facility will not be used for production of substrates until late in january  we received a business license for operations in beijing  china and purchased a  square foot facility in a major tax free industrial park in beijing 
this facility became operational during the third quarter of we intend to expand this facility by another  square feet beginning in the first quarter of we expect that our proprietary vgf crystal growth operations will continue to be housed in fremont  california  and our other manufacturing operations will be conducted in both fremont and beijing 
our consumer product division s operations have been located in torrance  california since and consist of a  square foot office and production facility 
prior to  a portion of the consumer products division was located in arizona and a portion in los angeles  california 
since  our visible emitter division has been located in a  square foot office and production facility in monterey park  california and a  square foot production facility in el monte  california 
in  we acquired another  square foot facility in el monte for future production in in late  we acquired a  square foot production facility in xiamen  china for processing laser diodes 
in connection with the granting of stock options  we recorded aggregate deferred compensation of  for the year ending december    in and in  representing the difference between the deemed fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price at the date of grant 
this deferred compensation will be amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options of which  was amortized during the year ended december    in and  in the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated

revenues increased  or million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues resulted primarily from a million increase in sales of gaas and inp substrates to existing domestic and international customers and the addition of new customers  a million increase due to the inclusion of the visible emitter division for a full year in compared to only the fourth quarter in  and a million decrease in consumer product sales reflecting declining sales prices for laser pointer products  an increase in sales returns due to product quality problems  and a change in government regulations regarding the allowable strength of laser products sold to the consumer product market in europe 
international revenues  excluding canada  increased from of total revenues  or million  for the year ended december   to or million for the year ended december  the increase in international revenues resulted primarily from a million increase in gaas and inp sales to new and existing international customers and a million increase due to the inclusion of the visible emitter division for a full year in compared to only the fourth quarter in gross margin 
gross margins decreased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  the gross margins for substrates decreased slightly from to  primarily due to a decline in sales prices 
the gross margins on products sold by the visible emitter division that was included for the full year in compared to only the fourth quarter in was in compared to in the decrease in margins at the visible emitter division was primarily due to significant sales price decreases for laser diodes  a million charge to settle a patent dispute  and a million charge to write down obsolete inventory 
excluding these charges  the gross margin was in gross margins on products sold by the consumer products division decreased from in to in  due to significant sales prices decreases for laser pointer products and a million charge to write down obsolete inventory 
excluding these charges  the gross margin was in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the inclusion of the visible emitter division for the full year in compared to only the fourth quarter of resulted in an increase of million 
substrate division expenses increased million primarily due to increases in personnel and related expenses required to support additional sales volume 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million by the consumer products division as a result of the closing of a manufacturing facility located in arizona in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to an increase in total revenues 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the inclusion of the visible emitter division for a full year in compared to only the fourth quarter in also  historically the consumer products division did not separately account for its research and development expenses which were included as part of its cost of product revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses and are now classified as research and development 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from of total revenues for the year ended december  to of revenues for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to an increase in total revenues 
acquisition cost 
as a result of the acquisition of lyte optronics in may  we incurred a number of one time expenses associated with the transaction in the approximate amount of million 
such expenses include fees paid to our investment bankers  accountants  attorneys  and other outside consultants and related transaction expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of the interest expense associated with equipment and real estate debt by the inclusion of the visible emitter division for a full year in compared to only the fourth quarter in and increased borrowing on the line of credit 
interest and other income expense 
interest and other income expense increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of foreign exchange gains on short term contracts to hedge against certain accounts receivable denominated in japanese yen 
provision for income taxes 
income tax expense  adjusted for acquisition costs of approximately million  decreased from to of income before provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and  respectively 
extraordinary item  net of tax benefit 
in connection with the acquisition of lyte optronics in may  we incurred fees associated with a loan that we repaid as part of the transaction 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased  or million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues resulted primarily from a million increase in the volume of sales of gaas and inp substrates to existing domestic and international customers  the addition of new customers and the introduction of ge substrates in the fourth quarter of additionally  there was a million increase due to the inclusion of the visible emitter division for the fourth quarter of  offset by a million decrease in revenues at the consumer products division reflecting declining sales prices for laser pointer products and a change in government regulations reducing the allowable strength of lasers sold to the consumer market in europe 
international revenues  excluding canada  increased from of total revenues for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  the increase in international revenues resulted primarily from a million increase in substrate sales to new and existing international customers and a million increase due to the inclusion of the visible emitter division for the fourth quarter of of which sales are primarily sold in asia  offset by a million decrease in sales to europe by the consumer products division caused by governmental regulation changes reducing the allowable strength of lasers sold to the consumer market 
gross margin 
gross margins increased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  the gross margins for substrates increased slightly from in to in reflecting higher yields achieved in gaas and inp production  partially offset by lower margins on ge substrates 
total gross margins also benefited from the inclusion of the visible emitter division for the fourth quarter of  which had a gross margin 
gross margins on products sold by the consumer products division decreased slightly from in to in due to declining prices for laser pointer products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  substrate division expenses increased million primarily due to increases in personnel and related expenses required to support additional sales volume 
the inclusion of the visible emitter division for the fourth quarter of added million 
these increases were offset by a million decrease at the consumer products division as a result of closing a manufacturing facility located in arizona in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this percentage decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased  or million  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from hiring additional engineers and the purchase of materials at the substrate division to develop new products and to enhance existing products 
also  historically the consumer products division did not separately account for its research and development expenses which were included as part of its cost of product revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses and are now classified as research and development 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the increase in spending 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  from  for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of additional borrowings to finance the purchase and lease of buildings and equipment at the substrate and consumer products divisions 
interest and other income expense 
interest and other income expense increased from an expense of  for the year ended december  to income of  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of interest income earned on the million in net proceeds raised from our initial public offering in may  provision for income taxes 
income tax expense decreased from of income before provision for income taxes in the year ended december  to in  due to a decrease in state income taxes caused by the realization of tax benefits of lyte optronics related to operating losses for which realization was uncertain prior to the merger

as of december   we had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to working capital at december  of million  including cash of million 
during the year ended december   net cash used in operations of million was due primarily to increases in inventory of million and accounts receivable of million  offset by net income of  depreciation of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
the increases in inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily the result of a increase in revenues from the prior year 
the inventory turnover ratio decreased from turns per year at december  to turns per year at december  primarily due to an increase ge inventory 
days sales outstanding decreased slightly from days at december  to days at december  during the year ended december   net cash used in operations of million was primarily due to increases in inventory of million  accounts receivable of million  prepaid assets of million  and deferred income taxes of million  offset by net income of million  depreciation of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
the increases in inventory  accounts receivable  prepaid assets  accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily the result of the increase in revenues from the prior year 
additionally  the increase in accounts receivable was in part due to increased international sales that generally have longer payment cycles 
international sales were of revenues in compared to of revenues in the increase in deferred taxes was the result of recognizing a tax benefit for prior year losses of lyte optronics as a result of the acquisition 
the inventory turnover ratio declined from turns per year at december  to turns per year at december  primarily due to our decision to maintain the ge substrates production line during the fourth quarter of in anticipation of large orders  although shipments to a large customer had been deferred 
days sales outstanding increased from days at december  to days at december  during the year ended december   net cash used in operations of million was primarily due to increases in inventory of million  accounts receivable of  million and prepaid expenses of million  offset in part by net income of  depreciation and amortization of million  and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
the increases in inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily the result of the increase in total revenues from the prior year 
additionally  the increase in accounts receivable was in part due as a result of increased international sales that generally have longer payment cycles 
international sales were of revenues in compared to of revenues in the increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to an increase in income tax receivables as a result of current year operating losses at the visible emitter and consumer products divisions 
the inventory turnover ratio decreased slightly from turns per year at december  to turns per year at december  days sales outstanding increased from days at december  to days at december net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which amounts were attributed in each period to the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
for the year ended december   the property acquired included our new  square foot building at a cost of million and the  square foot addition in fremont for million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   million for and million for for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the issuance of million of preferred stock and million for long term bank borrowings 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from our initial public offering and long term net borrowings of million  offset by repayments of short term borrowings of million 
long term net borrowings primarily reflected the issuance of million in taxable variable rate revenue bonds in november and repayment of existing long term debt in the amount of million 
long term borrowings were primarily used for the purchase of the new  square foot facility  for construction of the additional  square foot manufacturing space and related equipment in fremont 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from short term bank borrowings that were used to finance inventories and receivables  deposits for equipment orders  and to pay off high interest long term debt acquired in the acquisition of lyte optronics 
we have generally financed our equipment purchases through secured equipment loans over five year terms at interest rates ranging from to per annum 
our manufacturing facilities have been financed by long term borrowings  most of which were repaid by the taxable variable rate revenue bonds in the taxable variable rate revenue bonds have a term of years and mature in with an interest rate at basis points below the prime rate and are traded in the public market 
repayment of principal and interest under the bonds is secured by a letter of credit from our bank and is paid on a quarterly basis 
we have the option to redeem in whole or in part the bonds during their term 
at december   million was outstanding under the taxable variable rate revenue bonds 
we currently have a million line of credit with a commercial bank at an interest rate equal to the prime rate plus one half percent 
this line of credit is secured by all business assets  less equipment  and expires in may this line of credit is subject to certain financial covenants regarding current financial ratios and cash flow requirements  which were met as of december  we must obtain the lender s approval to obtain additional borrowings or to further pledge our assets  except for borrowings secured by the pledge of equipment or obtained in the normal course of business 
at december   million was outstanding under the million line of credit 
we anticipate that the combination of existing working capital and the borrowings available under current credit agreements will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  our profitability  the timing and extent of spending to support research and development programs  the expansion of selling and marketing and administrative activities  and market acceptance of our products 
we expect that we may need to raise additional equity or debt financing in the future  although we are not currently negotiating for additional financing nor do we have any plans to obtain additional financing at this time 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on the acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain such additional capital  if needed  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and selling and marketing activities  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that we do raise additional equity financing  further dilution to our investors will result 
year readiness during  we successfully completed our program to achieve year readiness 
year ready meant that the performance or functionality of our internal systems would not be significantly affected by the dates prior to  during  and after the year  to include leap year calculations and specific day of the week calculations 
as expected  we have not experienced a material adverse impact on our business  products  results of operations  or financial condition as a result of the year issue 
costs directly attributed to our internal year initiative were in line with the original estimate of approximately  these costs were expensed as incurred and were comprised primarily of the costs of hardware and software required to complete year testing within the enterprise and consulting fees 
we will continue to monitor our critical processes  and those of significant suppliers  third party external interface suppliers  and utility organizations that are critical to our operations  for potential year related problems 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas established a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and supersedes and amends a number of existing accounting standards 
sfas requires that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet at their fair market value 
in addition  corresponding derivative gains and losses should be either reported in the statement of operations or stockholders equity  depending on the type of hedging relationship that exists with respect to such derivatives 
adopting the provisions of sfas  which will be effective in fiscal year  is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting future results in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business before purchasing shares of our stock 
risks relating our acquisition of lyte optronics  inc 
our success depends on our ability to assume and integrate the operations of lyte optronics with our operations 
the success of our acquisition of lyte optronics depends in substantial part on our ability to assume and integrate the operations of lyte optronics in an efficient and effective manner 
the assumption of a new business will require the dedication of management resources  which may temporarily distract attention from our day to day operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate the business operations of lyte optronics smoothly or successfully 
our inability to do so could hurt the performance of our business  which may cause the price of our stock to decline 
the success of our acquisition of lyte optronics depends in part on our ability to retain lyte optronics current customers 
we cannot guarantee that the current customers of lyte optronics will continue to seek our services now that the acquisition is completed 
if a substantial number of lyte optronics customers elect not to seek our services  our operating results will suffer 
we incurred substantial costs in connection with our acquisition of lyte optronics  including the assumption of approximately million of debt  much of which has had to be repaid or renegotiated  resulting in a decline of cash available 
we incurred one time charges and merger related expenses of million and the extraordinary item of  in the quarter ended june  as a result of the acquisition 
we may incur additional unanticipated expenses related to our assumption of lyte optronics business 
if these expenses are substantial  they may adversely affect our operating results and cause our stock price to fall 
risks relating to our operations a number of factors could cause our quarterly financial results to be worse than expected  resulting in a decline in our stock price 
although we have been profitable on an annualized basis since  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results cannot be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decrease 
for more information regarding our results  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including our recent acquisition of lyte optronics and the integration of its business and separate operations and facilities with our operations  fluctuations in demand for our substrates due to reduction in the value on asian currencies and the turmoil in the asian financial markets  fluctuations in demand for laser pointing and alignment products and decreases in the prices of these products  our expense levels and expected research and development requirements  our ability to develop and bring to market new products on a timely basis  the volume and timing of orders from our customers  the availability of raw materials  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  our manufacturing expansion in beijing  china and the assumption  integration and operation of the chinese operations of lyte optronics  introduction of products and technologies by our competitors  and costs relating to possible acquisitions and integration of technologies or businesses 
for more information regarding our results  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we acquired lyte optronics in may  as part of our business strategy  and we may engage in future acquisitions 
these acquisitions must be successfully integrated into our business and may dilute our stockholders and cause us to assume contingent liabilities 
as part of our business strategy  we may in the future review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  or assume contingent liabilities 
any of these actions could materially adversely affect our operating results and or the price of our common stock 
any future acquisitions creates risks for us  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired personnel  operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition could materially adversely affect our operating results  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks of entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience  potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations  and loss of customers that  through product acquisition  now become competitors 
these risks and difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and our failure to do so could materially adversely affect our operating results 
the sales cycle for our gaas substrates is long and we may incur substantial  non recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur as anticipated 
our gaas substrates typically have a lengthy sales cycle  ranging from three months to a year or more 
during this time  we may expend substantial funds and sales  marketing and management efforts while the potential customer evaluates our substrates 
however  there is a significant risk that these expenditures may not result in sales 
if sales forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not delivered in that quarter  we may be unable to compensate for the shortfall  which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if a customer decides at the design stage not to incorporate our substrates into its products  we may not have another opportunity to sell substrates for those products for many months or even years 
we anticipate that sales of any future products under development will have similar lengthy sales cycles and will  therefore  be subject to risks substantially similar to those inherent in the lengthy sales cycle of our gaas substrates 
the loss of one or more of our key customers would significantly hurt our operating results 
a small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues 
we expect that a significant portion of our future sales will be due to a limited number of customers 
our top five customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
if any of these major customers reduces  delays or cancels its orders with us  our revenues will decline  which will likely cause our stock price to fall 
our customers are not obligated to purchase any specified quantity of products or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases 
in addition  our customers may reduce  delay or cancel orders at any time without any significant penalty 
for example  we recently announced the suspension of our ge substrates from a major customer who had excess inventories and was experiencing a slow down in business 
vgf is a new technique for producing substrates  which must achieve widespread acceptance if we are to succeed 
we believe that our competitors principally utilize the traditional lec or hb crystal growing processes for producing semi insulating and semi conducting gaas substrates 
we further believe that we are the only high volume supplier of semi insulating and semi conducting gaas substrates which utilize the vgf technique  a newer technology than either the lec or hb techniques  however  we believe that one of our competitors has recently begun shipping  in low volume  gaas substrates which utilize a similar technology 
we cannot assure you that our current customers will continue to use our vgf produced substrates or that additional companies will purchase our products manufactured from the vgf technique 
failure to gain increased market acceptance of our vgf technique by either current or prospective customers could materially adversely affect our operating results  which in turn could cause our stock price to fall 
a significant portion of our prospective customers for our substrates are wireless communications manufacturers  fiber optic communications manufacturers and manufacturers of other high speed semiconductor devices that are produced from gaas substrates using either the lec or hb techniques 
to establish the vgf technique as a preferred process for producing substrates for these prospective customers  we must offer products with superior prices and performance on a timely basis and in sufficient volumes 
we must also overcome the reluctance of these customers to purchase our gaas substrates due to possible perceptions of risks relating to concerns about the quality and cost effectiveness of our gaas substrates when compared to substrates produced by the traditional lec or hb techniques 
in addition  potential gaas substrate customers may be reluctant to rely on a relatively small company for critical materials used to manufacture their semiconductor devices 
if we do not achieve acceptable yields of crystals and the successful and timely production of substrates  the shipment of our products will be delayed and our revenues will decline 
the highly complex processes of growing crystals as well as other steps involved in manufacturing substrates that we engage in can be adversely affected by the following factors chemical or physical defects in the crystals  contamination of the manufacturing environment  substrate breakage  equipment failure  and performance of personnel involved in the manufacturing process 
our operating results have been adversely affected in the past due to the occurrence of a combination of these factors  which resulted in product shipment delays and adversely affected our business 
a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed 
as a result  we must increase the production volume of substrates and improve yields in order to reduce unit costs  increase margins and maintain and improve our results of operations 
any significant decrease in production volume and yields could materially harm our business 
in the past  we have sometimes manufactured substrates that have not met the manufacturing process requirements of our customers 
we have fixed these occurrences through minor changes to the substrates or the manufacturing process 
recurrence of these problems and our inability to solve them may materially hurt our performance 
in  we began producing and shipping ge and inp substrates in commercial volume 
we also understand that we must achieve the same manufacturing capability for six inch gaas wafers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to manufacture the larger gaas substrate in commercial volumes with acceptable yields 
our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected if we experience low yields of these successfully developed substrates 
because substantially all of our revenues of our axt substrate division are derived from sales of our gaas substrates  we are dependent on widespread market acceptance of these products 
we currently derive substantially all of our substrate revenues from sales of our gaas substrates 
if there is a decrease on demand for gaas substrates by semiconductor device manufacturers or if our competitors introduce new substrates for electronics applications  such as wireless communications  fiber optic communications and other high speed semiconductor devices  and opto electronic applications  such as lasers and leds  our revenues may decline and our business will be materially adversely affected 
we expect that revenues from gaas substrates will account for a significant majority of our revenues for the next several years 
further  other companies  including ibm  are actively involved in developing other devices which could provide the same high performance  low power capabilities as gaas based devices at competitive prices  such as silicon germanium based devices for use in certain wireless applications 
if these silicon germanium based devices are successfully developed and semiconductor device manufacturers adopt them  demand for gaas substrates could decrease 
this development could cause our revenues to fall 
to be successful  we must develop and introduce in a timely manner new substrates and continue to improve our current substrates to address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price and performance 
we must also continue to develop our light emitting and laser diode products  and develop new markets for this technology  as well as for our laser pointing and alignment products 
we cannot assure you that our product development efforts will be successful or that our new products will achieve market acceptance 
to the extent that product improvements and new product introductions do not achieve market acceptance  our business will be materially adversely affected 
in  we began commercial shipments of ge and inp substrates and are currently developing other substrates  including galliumnitride and silicon carbide 
factors that may affect the success of product improvements and product introductions include the development of markets for such improvements and substrates  achievement of acceptable yields  price and market acceptance 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property may adversely affect our ability to compete 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on employees  consultants and third parties from disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we believe that  due to the rapid pace of technological innovation in the gaas and other substrate markets  our ability to establish and maintain a position of technology leadership in the industry depends more on the skills of our development personnel than upon the legal protections afforded our existing technologies 
to date  we have been issued one us patent  which relates to the vgf technique  and have two us patent applications pending  one that relates to the vgf technique 
additionally  we have one pending application for a japanese patent but no issued foreign patents 
we do not have any patents on our light emitting or laser diode technology  although we do have six patents relating to our laser pointing and alignment products 
we cannot assure you that the pending or any future us or foreign patent applications will be approved  any issued patents will protect our intellectual property  third parties will not challenge the ownership rights of the patents or the validity of the patent applications  the patents owned by others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business  or others will not independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents issued to us 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries may not lend protection to our patents to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
if we infringe the proprietary rights of others  we may be forced to enter costly royalty or licensing agreements 
we could in the future receive a claim that we are infringing the patent  trademark  copyright or other proprietary rights of other third parties 
if any claims were asserted against us for violation of patent  trademark  copyright or other similar laws as a result of the use by us  our customers or other third parties of our products  those claims would be costly and time consuming to defend  would divert our attention and could cause product delays 
in addition  if we discovered we violated other third party rights  we could be required to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements as a result of those claims 
these royalty or licensing agreements may adversely affect our operating results 
if we fail to comply with stringent environmental regulations  we may be subject to significant fines or the cessation of our operations 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
any failure to comply with present or future environmental laws and regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines on us  the suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
in addition  existing or future changes in laws or regulations may require us to incur further significant expenditures or liabilities  or additional restriction in our operations 
we are cooperating with cal osha in an investigation regarding higher than permissible levels of potentially hazardous materials in certain areas of the manufacturing facility in fremont  california 
although no accidents or injuries have resulted from this matter and the facility is in full operation  civil and criminal penalties could be imposed against us by cal osha 
we purchase critical raw materials required to grow crystals from single or limited sources  and could lose sales if these sources fail to fill our needs 
we do not have any long term supply contracts  except for ge  with any of our suppliers  and we currently purchase raw materials required to grow crystals from single or a limited number of suppliers 
for example  we purchase a majority of the gallium we use from geo gallium 
due to our reliance on a limited group of suppliers  we are exposed to several risks including the potential inability to obtain adequate supply of materials  reduced control overpricing of our products and meeting customer delivery schedules 
we have experienced delays receiving orders of certain materials due to shortages 
we may continue to experience these delays due to shortages of materials and as a result be subject to higher costs 
if we are unable to receive adequate and timely deliveries of critical raw materials  relationships with current and future customers could be harmed  which could cause our revenues to decline 
we are subject to additional risks as a result of our recent acquisition of new manufacturing facilities 
in connection with further expanding our manufacturing capacity  we purchased an additional  square foot facility in fremont  california and a  square foot facility in beijing  china  in these new facilities subject us to significant risks  including unavailability or late delivery of process equipment  unforeseen engineering problems  work stoppages  unanticipated cost increases  and unexpected changes or concessions required by local  state or federal regulatory agencies with respect to necessary licenses  land use permits and building permits 
if any of the above occur  our operations at the new facilities would be adversely affected  which may cause our sales to decline and the price of our stock to fall 
the additional fixed operating expenses associated with the new facilities may only be offset by sufficient increases in product revenues 
we cannot assure you that the demand for our products will grow as we currently expect  and if this does not occur  we may not be able to offset the costs of operating the new facilities  which may materially adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently only have two machines mocvd s capable of producing light emitting diode wafers 
damage to or failure of these machines could cause production to stop or delay while repairs or replacements are being made 
we do not keep substantial inventory of led wafers to enable production to continue while the mocvd machine is being repaired 
any delay in production of the led wafers while the mocvd is being repaired could result in loss of revenue 
we must effectively respond to rapid technological changes by continually introducing new products that achieve broad market acceptance 
we and our customers compete in a market that is characterized by rapid technological changes and continuous improvements in substrates 
accordingly  our future success depends upon whether we can apply our proprietary vgf technique to develop new substrates that meet the needs of customers and compete effectively on the basis of quality  price and performance 
our success in the light emitting and laser diode markets depends in part upon our ability to further our development of this technology and develop additional markets and uses for the products 
if we are unable to timely develop new  economically viable products that meet market demands  our revenues will decline  which could adversely affect our results of operation and cause the price of our stock to fall 
it is difficult to predict accurately the time required and the costs involved in researching  developing and engineering new products 
thus  our actual development costs could exceed budgeted amounts and our product development schedules could require extension 
we have experienced product development delays in the past and may experience similar delays in the future 
any significant delays could harm our business 
for example  our introduction of inp substrates was delayed approximately six months as a result of delays in the finalization of the manufacturing process for these substrates 
if we are unable to introduce reliable quality products  we could suffer from reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  product returns and additional service expenses  all of which could result in lower revenues 
our substrates are typically one of many components used in semiconductor devices that our customers produce 
demand for our products is therefore subject to many factors beyond our control  including demand for our customers products  competition faced by our customers in their particular industries  the technical  sales and marketing and management capabilities of our customers  and the financial and other resources of our customers 
if  as a result of any of these factors  demand for our products declines  our business will suffer 
intense competition in the market for gaas substrates could prevent us from increasing revenues and sustaining profitability 
the market for gaas substrates is intensely competitive 
if we cannot successfully compete in this market  our operating results will be harmed 
in the semi insulating gaas substrates market  our principal competitors include freiberger compound materials  hitachi cable  litton airtron  and sumitomo electric industries 
we also compete with manufacturers that produce gaas substrates for their own use 
in addition  we compete with companies  such as ibm  that are actively developing alternative materials to gaas 
as we enter new markets  such as the ge and inp substrate markets  we expect to face competitive risks similar to those for our gaas substrates 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have a number of significant advantages over us  including having been in the business longer than we have  more manufacturing experience  more established technologies than our vgf technique  broader name recognition  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
our competitors could develop enhancements to the lec  hb or vgf techniques that are superior to ours in terms of price and performance 
our competitors also could intensify price based competition  which would result in lower prices and reduced margins 
the market for laser pointing and alignment devices is highly competitive and subject to pressure to decrease the price at which the devices are sold 
lyte optronics has opened a manufacturing facility in china enabling production of components at reduced cost  however this facility has only recently begun operating and may not be able to handle the volume production that may be required to meet customer demand 
in addition  while we continue to remain competitive in our pricing structure of laser pointing and alignment devices  if prices continue to fall  we may not be able to produce and sell these products at a profit 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from international sales and our ability to sustain and increase our international sales involves significant risks 
our ability to grow will depend in part on the expansion of international sales and operations  which have and are expected to constitute a significant portion of our revenues 
our failure to successfully expand our international operations may cause our revenues not to grow as much as we anticipate  which could cause our stock price to fall 
international sales  excluding canada  represented and of our total revenues in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
sales to customers located in japan and other asian countries represented and of our total revenues in the years ended december  and december  we expect that sales to customers outside the united states  including device manufacturers located in japan and other asian countries that sell their products worldwide  will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues 
our dependence on international sales involves a number of risks  including import restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer periods to collect accounts receivable  export license requirements  political and economic instability  in particular  the current instability of the economies of japan and other asian countries  and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
our sales  except for sales to our japanese and taiwanese customers  are denominated in us dollars 
thus  increases in the value of the dollar could increase the price of our products in non us markets and make our products more expensive than competitors products in such markets 
for example  doing business in japan subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
in the year ended december  we incurred foreign exchange losses of  and a foreign exchange gain of  in the year ended december  if we do not effectively manage the risks associated with international sales  our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
to minimize our foreign exchange risk  we have purchased foreign exchange contracts to hedge against certain trade accounts receivable in japanese yen 
because we currently denominate sales in us dollars except in japan and taiwan  we do not anticipate that the adoption of the euro as a functional legal currency of certain european countries will materially affect our business 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of morris s 
young  phd  axt s president and chief executive officer  as well as other key management and technical personnel 
we neither have long term employment contracts with  nor key person life insurance on  any of our key personnel  including any of the key personnel from our acquisition of lyte optronics 
in addition  our management team has limited experience as executive officers of a public company 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel 
the competition for these employees is intense  especially in silicon valley  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  including the introduction of new products on time 
continued rapid growth may strain our operations 
in addition to our recent acquisition of lyte optronics  we have recently experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion that has placed  and continues to place  a significant strain on our operations 
to accommodate this anticipated growth  we will be required to improve existing and implement new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  hire  train and manage additional qualified personnel  effectively manage multiple relationships with our customers  suppliers and other third parties  and maintain effective cost controls 
if we are not able to install adequate control systems in an efficient and timely manner  or if our current or planned personnel systems  procedures and controls are not adequate to support our future operations  our sales may not grow and our business will suffer 
we are in the process of installing a new management information system  however  the functionality of this new system has not been fully implemented 
the difficulties associated with installing and implementing these new systems  procedures and controls has placed and will continue to place a significant burden on our management and our internal resources 
in addition  international growth will require expansion of our worldwide operations and enhance our communications infrastructure 
any delay in the implementation of these new or enhanced systems  products and controls  or any disruption in the transition to these new or enhanced systems  products and controls  could adversely affect our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage manufacturing  purchasing and inventory levels  and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
our inability to manage growth effectively could affect our revenues and adversely impact our profitability 
in addition  lyte optronics maintains separate operational and financial systems  procedures and controls that must be integrated with or replaced by our systems 
this integration will take time and divert management attention and resources 
if we are unable to timely integrate or replace these systems  we maybe unable to accurately forecast sales demand  manage manufacturing  purchasing and inventory levels for the two divisions acquired with lyte optronics  nor record and report financial and management information on a timely basis for these divisions  which could adversely affect our ability to timely produce consolidated financial information 
we may need additional capital to fund our future operations  which may not be available 
we believe that our cash balances and cash available from credit facilities and future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
if cash from future operations is insufficient  or if cash is used for acquisitions or other currently unanticipated uses  we may need additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to existing stockholders 
in december  we raised approximately million by issuing variable rate taxable demand revenue bonds series for the purchase of a commercial building and to finance tenant improvements at technology drive  fremont  california  the refinance an existing loan and to finance tenant improvements on our principal offices  and the permanent financing for an existing bank construction loan 
these debt securities have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to holders of common stock 
we cannot assure you that if we required additional capital  it will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our executive officers and directors control of our common stock and are able to significantly influence matters requiring stockholder approval 
executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them currently own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  if acting together  are able to significantly influence all matters requiring our stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
this concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change of control of axt and could reduce the likelihood of an acquisition of axt at a premium price 
provisions in our charter or agreements may delay or prevent a change of control 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition or a change of control or changes in our management 
these provisions include the division of the board of directors into three separate classes of three year terms  the right of the board to elect the director to fill a space created by the expansion of the board  the ability of the board to alter our bylaws  authorizing the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock  and the requirement that at least of the outstanding shares are needed to call a special meeting of stockholders 
furthermore  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of the outstanding voting stock  from consummating a merger or combination with a corporation unless of the shares of voting stock not owned by this large stockholder approve the merger or combination  or the board of directors approves the merger or combination or the transaction which resulted in the large stockholder owning or more of our outstanding voting stock 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and is dependent on external and internal factors 
our stock has fluctuated significantly since we began trading on the nasdaq national market 
for the fiscal year ended december   our stock price closed as low as and as high as 
various factors could cause the price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate substantially  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of securities analysts  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  new product introduction by us or our competitors  large customer orders or order cancellations  and the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since many of our japanese invoices are denominated in yen  we have bought foreign exchange contracts to hedge against certain trade accounts receivable in japanese yen 
as of december   our outstanding commitments with respect to the foreign exchange contracts had a total value of approximately million equivalent 
many of the contracts were entered six months prior to the due date and the dates coincide with the receivable terms we have on the invoices 
by matching the receivable collection date and contract due date  we attempt to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuation
