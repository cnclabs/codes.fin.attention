item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets products based on its proprietary interface technologies  which provide the capability to bridge wireline telecommunications customer premises equipment cpe with cellular type transceivers for use in wireless communication networks in the cellular and pcs bands 
applications of the company s technology include fixed wireless telecommunications as a primary access service where wireline systems are unavailable  unreliable or less economical  as well as wireless backup systems for wireline telephone systems and wireless security and alarm monitoring signaling 
the company s principal product lines are phonecell r  a line of fixed wireless terminals fwts  and telguard r  a line of cellular alarm transmission systems 
currently  the company is devoting a substantial portion of its resources to international market development  extension of its core product line to new wireless standards  expansion  protection and licensing of its intellectual property rights and development of underlying radio technology 
the company s operating expense levels are based in large part on expectations of future revenues 
if anticipated sales in any quarter do not occur as expected  expenditure and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and the company s operating results for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  could be adversely affected 
certain factors that could significantly impact expected results are described in cautionary statements pursuant to the securities litigation reform act that is set forth in exhibit to this document 
overview major trends driving the market for the company s products include a broad consumer acceptance of cellular communications  rapid privatization of telecommunications in developed and developing countries  adoption of digital wireless transmission standards that enhance network capacity and service  service network providers acceptance of fwts as cost effective answers to customer demand for improved telecommunications and the trend of licensing multiple operators in a given region  which intensifies competition among wireless service providers to capture additional minutes of usage and the potential for a large wireline bypass market 
wireless local loop wll  which is the core of the company s prospects for the phonecell r business in developing countries  involves cellular infrastructure employed predominately and sometimes exclusively for the fixed location user 
continued growth of the wll market depends primarily on the pricing of wll airtime service to the customer relative to available wireline prices  the relative local availability of wll and wireline service  operator regulatory constraints on fixed cellular  and availability of money in a given country 
these factors have contributed to an increase in the number of new cellular networks  primarily in brazil  china  india  mexico  spain and turkey 
wireless alternative access  which represents the majority of the company s current sales in developed countries  has primarily involved an alternative to existing wireline systems  and where wireline service is unavailable  unreliable or less economical  placing fwts on cellular networks built for mobile cellular phones to provide regular telephone service 
management anticipates that additional fwt markets for wireless alternative access applications will develop as existing cellular networks mature and new networks and services are introduced 
as capacity and price competition increase on new and existing cellular networks and the growth rate in new cellular phone subscribers slows  mobile cellular operators will be forced to look for new revenue sources 
fwts provide an excellent opportunity for cellular network operators  as they are less costly to support than mobile units permanently linked to a specific cell site  generate more average airtime  and operate mainly at off peak times 
the number of fwts presently operating on these networks is driven by the relative price for airtime  as well as by the large installed base of mobile networks worldwide 
the company has a number of undertakings that embody its strategy to capitalize on the alternate access growth it anticipates for fwts 
the company s strategy is to leverage its fourteen years of experience in the market  internationally accepted products and court tested patents into a continuing leadership position in the rapidly developing fwt equipment industry 
global telecommunications equipment manufacturers together with national and international service providers are increasingly sharing the company s vision that wireless cellular systems in both developed and developing countries are well suited for use as basic telephone service networks 
the company believes that its future success depends on its ability to continue to meet customer s needs through product innovation  rapid time to market with new products  and superior in market customer support 
telular works closely with cellular service providers  telecommunications infrastructure suppliers and equipment manufacturers  to develop new fixed wireless products for global wll and other fixed wireless markets 
current product lines deploy the major worldwide cellular air interface standards gsm  tdma  cdma  and amps 
development programs are progressing for next generation digital technologies 
the company s research and development staff is highly focused on developing a steady stream of competitive products addressing fixed wireless terminal and cellular alarm transmission system market opportunities 
its technology competence encompasses all major cellular air interface standards  which is reflected in the broadest product line offering in the industry 
during fiscal year  the company improved its fwt market position on gsm and tdma radio standards 
the company introduced a voice  fax and data version of the phonecell r sx gsm fwt in both mhz and mhz bands and phonecell r sxd gsm deskphones in both mhz and mhz bands 
the company introduced its third generation tdma fwt  the phonecell r sx tdma fwt 
the phonecell r sx tdma fwt is is compliant  incorporates the company s latest product innovations including platform miniaturization and feature enhancements  and utilizes a transceiver made by ericsson radio systems ab 
also in the company introduced the phonecell r sxd tdma desktop phone providing basic voice communications in a cost effective package with an integrated handset 
during fiscal year  the company entered into a year distribution agreement with motorola  allowing the company to distribute a cdma fwt made by motorola 
in july motorola announced the discontinuance of that product and their exiting the wll business 
the terms of that discontinuance are still under discussion 
meanwhile the company is pursuing obtaining its own cdma technology license  allowing the company to develop and manufacture its own cdma fwt
