the company expensed the costs to make modifications to existing computer systems and non computer equipment 
management currently estimates the remaining new computer system costs to be million to million 
while this has been a substantial effort  the results should give the company the benefits of new technology and functionality for many of its financial and operational computer systems and applications 
inflation health care costs continue to rise at a faster rate than the consumer price index 
the company uses various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation  including setting commercial premiums based on its anticipated health care costs  risk sharing arrangements with the company s various health care providers  and other health care cost containment measures including member co payments 
there can be no assurance  however  that  in the future  the company s ability to manage medical costs will not be negatively impacted by items such as technological advances  competitive pressures  applicable regulations  increases in pharmacy costs  utilization changes and catastrophic items  which could  in turn  result in medical cost increases equaling or exceeding premium increases 
government regulation the company s business  offering health care coverage  health care management services  workers compensation programs and  to a lesser extent  the delivery of medical services  is heavily regulated at both the federal and state levels 
government regulation of health care coverage products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  including legislative proposals to eliminate or reduce erisa pre emption of state laws  that would increase potential litigation exposure and interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change from time to time 
regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion in promulgating regulations and in interpreting and enforcing laws and regulations 
while the company is unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or the impact on the company of any particular change  the company s operations and financial results could be negatively affected by regulatory revisions 
for example  any proposals affecting underwriting practices  limiting rate increases  increasing litigation exposure  requiring new or additional benefits or affecting contracting arrangements including proposals to require hmos and ppos to accept any health care providers willing to abide by an hmo s or ppo s contract terms may have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the continued consideration and enactment of anti managed care laws and regulations by federal and state bodies may make it more difficult for the company to manage medical costs and may adversely affect financial results 
in addition to changes in applicable laws and regulations  the company is subject to various audits  investigations and enforcement actions 
these include possible government actions relating to the federal employee retirement income security act  which regulates insured and self insured health coverage plans offered by employers  the federal employees health benefit plan  federal and state fraud and abuse laws  and laws relating to utilization management and the delivery of health care 
any such government action could result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including exclusion from participation in government programs 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect the company s reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for the company to sell its products and services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company has approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  and current  long term and restricted investments 
of the investments  approximately million is classified as available for sale investments and million is classified as held to maturity investments 
these investments are primarily in fixed income  investment grade securities 
the company s investment policies emphasize return of principal and liquidity and are focused on fixed returns that limit volatility and risk of principal 
because of the company s investment policies  the primary market risk associated with the company s portfolio is interest rate risk 
assuming an immediate increase in interest rates  the net hypothetical loss in fair value of shareholders equity related to financial instruments is estimated to be approximately million after tax of total shareholders equity 
the company believes that such an increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows as it is unlikely that the company would need or choose to substantially liquidate its investment portfolio 
the effect of interest rate risk on potential near term net income  cash flow and fair value was determined based on commonly used sensitivity analyses 
the models project the impact of interest rate changes on a wide range of factors  including duration and prepayment 
fair value was estimated based on the net present value of cash flows or duration estimates  assuming an immediate increase in interest rates
