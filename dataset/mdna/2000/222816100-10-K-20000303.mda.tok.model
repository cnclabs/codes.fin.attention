item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview covance is a leading contract research organization providing a wide range of product development services on a worldwide basis to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries 
covance also provides services such as health economics and outcomes for managed care organizations  hospitals and other health care providers and laboratory testing to the chemical  agrochemical and food industries 
the foregoing services comprise two segments for financial reporting purposes early development services includes preclinical and phase i clinical  and late stage development services includes clinical development  clinical support  biomanufacturing and commercialization 
covance believes it is one of the largest biopharmaceutical contract research organizations  based on annual net revenues  and one of a few that is capable of providing comprehensive global product development services 
covance offers its clients high quality services designed to reduce product development time 
this enables covance s customers to introduce their products into the marketplace faster and as a result  maximize the period of market exclusivity and monetary return on their research and development investments 
additionally  covance s comprehensive services and broad experience provide its customers with a variable cost alternative to fixed cost internal development capabilities 
historically  a majority of covance s net revenues have been earned under contracts 
these contracts generally range in duration from a few months to two years 
revenue from these contracts is generally recognized under either the percentage of completion method of accounting or as services are rendered or products are delivered 
the contracts may contain provisions for renegotiation for cost overruns arising from changes in the scope of work 
renegotiated amounts are included in net revenues when earned and realization is assured 
in some cases  for multi year contracts a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the trial is initiated 
additional payments are made based upon the achievement of performance based milestones over the contract duration 
covance routinely subcontracts with independent physician investigators in connection with either single or multi site clinical trials 
investigator fees are not reflected in net revenues or expenses since these investigator fees are paid by the customers to covance on a pass through basis ie without risk or reward to covance 
most contracts are terminable either immediately or upon notice by the client 
these contracts typically require payment to covance of expenses to wind down a study  payment to covance of fees earned to date  and  in some cases  a termination fee or a payment to covance of some portion of the fees or profit that could have been earned by covance under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
covance segregates its recurring operating expenses among three categories cost of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
cost of revenue consists of appropriate amounts necessary to complete the revenue and earnings process  and includes direct labor and related benefit charges  other direct costs and an allocation of facility charges and information technology costs 
cost of revenue  as a percentage of net revenues  tends and is expected to fluctuate from one period to another  as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involving hundreds of studies conducted during any period of time 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll and related benefit charges  advertising and promotional expenses  administrative travel and an allocation of facility charges and information technology costs

the slowdown in growth in the late stage development segment was the result of a slowdown in large clinical orders  the impact of a major contract cancellation due to molecule performance  and a significant reduction in scope of another large program due to sponsor funding pressures 
the slowdown was compounded by a moderation of growth in central laboratory services 
net revenues from covance s more mature early development segment grew in  or  excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange rate variances between both periods

depreciation and amortization increased to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for due to increased depreciation expense associated with capital spending and the goodwill amortization associated with the november acquisitions of berkeley antibody company  inc and gdxi  inc 
and the contingent purchase price payments made in for two acquisitions completed in in order to improve its global competitiveness  better optimize capacity utilization and enhance quality and service worldwide  covance has consolidated its regionally based phase ii and iii clinical services under one global management structure and formed a unified sales force for its clinical development  central laboratory  packaging and other related clinical support services 
primarily in connection with these actions  in the third quarter of  covance recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million million net of tax consisting primarily of million in severance and related benefits arising from the elimination of approximately managerial and staff positions 
severance payments began in september and will continue into as of december   a total of employees have been terminated and a total of million in costs have been paid 
in connection with the june termination of a proposed merger  covance incurred one time  out of pocket transaction and integration related costs primarily professional fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and consultants of million million  net of tax

excluding the impact of the merger related charge and the restructuring charge  income from operations increased to million  or of net revenues  from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
the reduction in operating income as a percentage of net revenues is attributable to the increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenues  the increase in depreciation and amortization  and higher year project expenses in versus excluding the impact of the merger related charge and the restructuring charge  income from operations from covance s early development segment increased million or to million or of net revenues for the year ended december  from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period

the reduction in the growth of late stage development operating income was due to the softness in clinical development and central laboratory services discussed above

net income increased million or to million for from million for quarterly results covance s quarterly operating results are subject to variation  and are expected to continue to be subject to variation  as a result of a variety of factors including  without limitation  delays in initiating or completing significant drug development trials  termination of drug development trials  acquisitions  and exchange rate fluctuations 
delays and terminations of studies or trials are often the result of actions taken by covance s customers or regulatory authorities and are not typically controllable by covance 
since a large amount of covance s operating costs are relatively fixed while revenue is subject to fluctuation  minor variations in the commencement  progress or completion of drug development trials may cause significant variations in quarterly operating results

liquidity and capital resources covance has a centralized domestic cash management function whereby cash received from operations is generally swept daily to a centrally managed concentration account 
cash disbursements for operations are funded as needed from the concentration account 
from time to time excess cash balances are maintained at covance  generally for specific cash requirements 
covance s primary cash needs on both a short and long term basis are for capital expenditures  expansion of services  possible future acquisitions  geographic expansion  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
management believes that through a combination of borrowings under the credit facility as defined below  cash generated from operations and capital that covance believes could be made available to it from other credit sources if required  covance will have sufficient financial flexibility and ready access to cash on both a short term and a long term basis to fund  as required  capital expenditures  potential future acquisitions and other longer term growth opportunities 
at december   there was million of outstanding borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit  resulting in a remaining availability of million under covance s five year million senior revolving credit facility the credit facility 
covance has several different interest rate options available to it under the credit facility 
interest on all outstanding borrowings under the credit facility during was computed based upon the london interbank offered rate plus a margin and approximated per annum 
the credit facility expires in november and contains various covenants which  among other things  may restrict covance from engaging in certain financing activities and prohibits covance from paying cash dividends on the covance common stock during a default or an event of default  as defined in the credit facility  or if after giving effect to the payment of such dividends covance would not be in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit facility 
at december   covance was in compliance with the terms of the credit facility 
in december  covance financed its newly constructed north american packaging facility through a five year  million mortgage which bears interest at a rate of per annum 
covance biotechnology services inc covance biotechnology has a million short term revolving credit facility with a bank  of which million of borrowings were outstanding as of december  this short term revolving credit facility carries interest at a rate substantially equivalent to the rate in effect on covance s borrowings under the credit facility and is guaranteed by covance 
in december  covance biotechnology repaid million in short term debt with the north carolina biotechnology center 
in october  a foreign subsidiary of covance borrowed million swiss francs from a bank 
this loan bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum and matures in october these funds were used to repay certain cross currency intercompany obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
in connection with this loan  covance provided a letter of credit in favor of the lender which may be drawn upon in event of default 
during the year ended december   covance s operations provided net cash of million  an increase of million from the corresponding amount 
cash flows from net earnings adjusted for non cash activity provided million during  up million or from the corresponding amount of million 
the change in net operating assets used million in cash during  primarily due to an increase in unbilled services and unearned revenue and a decrease in accrued liabilities  while this net change used million in cash during  primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable 
covance s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  and at december  investing activities for the year ended december  used million compared to million for the corresponding period 
capital spending for totaled million  primarily for outfitting of new facilities  purchase of new equipment  upgrade of existing equipment and computer equipment and software for newly hired employees  as well as the purchase of covance s new north american packaging facility  compared to million for the corresponding period 
investing activities for the year ended december  included cash payments of contingent purchase price totaling approximately million in connection with two of covance s acquisitions 
investing activities during included million in cash payments to purchase gdxi  inc and berkeley antibody company  inc 
as discussed in note to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  covance has entered  and may from time to time in the future  enter into build to suit operating lease arrangements 
these transactions may allow covance to purchase the underlying facility and or equipment or cancel the lease arrangement on various dates over the lease term 
in the event of cancellation  covance may be obligated under residual value guarantee provisions of the leases 
covance has one lease arrangement whereby it has a contingent residual value guarantee payment in the event that covance terminates the lease and the sale of the underlying facility and equipment results in sales proceeds by the lessor in an amount less than the lessor s unamortized investment in the lease arrangement 
under these circumstances  covance s maximum payment would have approximated million at the end of the first year of the lease and decreases to approximately million at the end of the tenth year of the lease  assuming covance terminates the lease and the sales proceeds received by the lessor were zero 
competition covance s clinical development services participates in a competitive industry 
covance believes that this industry is experiencing an increase in price competition which is having  and if such trend continues  could continue to have a material adverse effect on net revenues and net income from covance s clinical development services operations 
foreign currency since covance operates on a global basis  it is exposed to various foreign currency risks 
two specific risks arise from the nature of the contracts covance executes with its customers since from time to time contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular covance subsidiary s local currency 
this contract currency denomination issue is generally applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by covance s foreign subsidiaries providing clinical services 
the first risk occurs as revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the subsidiary s expenses are incurred 
as a result  the subsidiary s net revenues and resultant earnings can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
some contracts provide that currency fluctuations from the rates in effect at the time the contract is executed are the responsibility of the customer 
other contracts provide that currency fluctuations from the rates in effect at the time the contract is executed up to a specified threshold generally plus or minus a few percentage points are absorbed by covance while fluctuations in excess of the threshold are the customer s responsibility 
most contracts do not specifically address responsibility for currency fluctuations 
historically  fluctuations in exchange rates from those in effect at the time contracts were executed have not had a material effect upon covance s consolidated financial results 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  covance recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared and payment from the customer is received will result in covance receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by covance as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other expense income in covance s consolidated statements of income 
finally  covance s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting covance s consolidated financial results 
the process by which each foreign subsidiary s financial results are translated into us dollars is as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet asset and liability accounts at current rates and equity accounts at historical rates results in the creation of the cumulative translation adjustment stockholders equity account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiaries us dollar balance sheets and is necessary to keep the foreign subsidiaries balance sheets stated in us dollars in balance 
to date such cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to covance s consolidated financial position 
taxes since covance conducts operations on a global basis  covance s effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of its pre tax earnings among locations with varying tax rates 
covance s profits are further impacted by changes in the tax rates of the various jurisdictions 
in particular  as the geographic mix of covance s pre tax earnings among various tax jurisdictions changes  covance s effective tax rate may vary from period to period 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
inflation while most of covance s net revenues are earned under contracts  long term contracts those in excess of one year generally include an inflation or cost of living adjustment for the portion of the services to be performed beyond one year from the contract date 
as a result  covance believes that the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse effect on its operations or financial condition 
year issues commencing in  covance planned and implemented a year assessment and remediation plan 
the plan approached the year problem from an internal  supplier and customer perspective 
as a result of this plan  covance s information systems have been successfully transitioned into the year and covance s operations have not been adversely affected by year computer issues 
beginning in early  covance began to incur costs and make expenditures related to the year project 
covance expects to continue to incur costs and make expenditures relating to the year project into the year these costs and expenditures can be broadly classified into two categories amounts that will be expensed as incurred 
these amounts consist of internal payroll relating to employees newly hired or redeployed to work on the year project  external consultants and the net book value of non year compliant equipment to be replaced  and amounts that will be capitalized and depreciated over the useful lives of the associated assets 
these amounts consist of the purchase price of new hardware  software and other equipment acquired to replace existing hardware  software and other equipment that is not year compliant 
covance currently estimates that the costs of internal payroll  external consultants and the net book value of equipment to be replaced  amounts that have and will be expensed as incurred  will total between million and million over the three year period ending december  of these amounts  a total of million has been incurred and expensed during the two year period ended december  million in and million in covance currently estimates that the cost of new hardware  software and other equipment to be acquired in replacement of existing non year compliant hardware  software and other equipment will total between million and million 
of these amounts  capitalizable expenditures totaling million have been made during the two year period ended december  million in and million in 
the primary source of funds for all costs yet to be incurred and expenditures to be made is expected to be provided by covance s operating cash flows
