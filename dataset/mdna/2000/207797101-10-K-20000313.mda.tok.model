item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition overview connecticut water service  inc the company is a non operating holding company  whose income is derived from the earnings of its six wholly owned subsidiary companies 
approximately of the company s earnings are attributable to the connecticut water company  the company s largest water utility subsidiary with approximately an additional derived from the company s two other regulated water utility companies  the gallup water service  incorporated and the crystal water company of danielson 
these three companies supply water to  customers in towns throughout the state of connecticut 
each of these companies is subject to regulation by the connecticut department of public utility control regarding financial issues  rates  and operating issues and to various other state and federal regulatory agencies concerning water quality and environmental standards 
in addition to its regulated utilities  the company owns three unregulated companies  chester realty  inc a real estate company  connecticut water utility services  inc which provides contract water and sewer operations and other water related services and crystal water utilities corporation  a holding company which owns the crystal water company of danielson and small rental properties 
these unregulated companies currently generate of the company s total earnings 
was the company s th consecutive year of increased earnings and its th year of increased dividend payments 
regulatory matters and inflation the connecticut water company is the company s largest subsidiary serving  of the company s  utility customers 
connecticut water company s revenues are based on regulated rates that are determined in a regulatory rate proceeding 
connecticut water s last general rate proceeding was in the resulting rate decision granted connecticut water a allowed return on common equity and a allowed return on rate base 
during this decision was reopened for the limited purposes of flowing through to customers cost savings related to a reduction in state gross earnings taxes payable by connecticut water and allowing connecticut water to collect certain costs related to postretirement benefits other than pension 
connecticut water s rates were reduced approximately due to the limited reopened rate proceeding 
connecticut water s resulting reduction in revenues was offset by a corresponding reduction in its operating expenses 
the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve and expand its service capability 
the cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility replacement costs  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
the ability of the company s water utility subsidiaries to recover this increased investment in facilities is primarily dependent upon future rate increases  which are subject to approval by the connecticut department of public utility control 
we do not presently plan to petition the dpuc for an increase in permanent rates in future economic and financial market conditions  coupled with governmental regulations and fiscal policy  plus other factors which are unpredictable and often beyond our control  will influence when we request revisions to rates charged to our customers 
outlook the company s profitability is primarily attributable to the sale and distribution of water  the amount of which is dependent on seasonal weather fluctuations  particularly during the summer months when water demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels 
we are continuing our expansion through acquisitions into in we signed an agreement to purchase the white sand beach water system in old lyme  connecticut which services customers 
a decision by the department of public utility control on our application to acquire white sand is expected in march  results of operations compared with during the company acquired gallup water service  inc and crystal water utilities corporation and accounted for these acquisitions as pooling of interests

as of february   the company is not aware of any year related problems associated with our internal systems or software or with the software and systems of our vendors  distributors or suppliers
