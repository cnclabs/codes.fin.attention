overview we provide specialized contract pharmacy services for the treatment of patients with costly  chronic diseases 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of drugs to patients 
the following table presents the percentage of our total revenue generated from sales and services provided with respect to the diseases that we service for the years ended june multiple sclerosis gaucher disease hemophilia and autoimmune disorders growth hormone related disorders respiratory syncytial virus crohn s disease rheumatoid arthritis sales and services with respect to multiple sclerosis  gaucher disease  growth hormone related disorders  crohn s disease and rheumatoid arthritis are dependent upon our preferred relationships with biogen  genzyme  genentech and centocor 
our agreements with these manufacturers describe the services to be provided by us  including contract pharmacy  information  clinical  reimbursement and customized delivery services 
these agreements generally o limit our ability to supply competing drugs during and in some cases up to five years after the term of the agreement  o allow the manufacturer to distribute directly or through other parties  and o are short term and may be cancelled by either party  without cause  upon between and days prior notice 
these agreements vary in level of exclusivity and scope of services provided 
we typically purchase products at prices below the manufacturers average wholesale sales prices  and our resulting contribution margins vary for each product line 
pricing is customized to reflect specific services to be provided by us and is subject to periodic adjustments to reflect changing market conditions 
we purchase drugs for hemophilia and autoimmune disorders from all available sources on a volume discount basis 
we were one of the national providers selected by medimmune  inc to distribute drugs for respiratory syncytial virus for the season and are in discussions with medimmune  inc to be a national provider for the season 
we recognize revenue at the time we ship drugs or when we have performed the contractual service 
while we may experience revenue changes from price fluctuations on our existing product lines  our revenue growth will depend principally on the introduction of new drugs and  to a lesser extent  on volume growth in existing drug lines 
we have six joint venture agreements with various medical centers or their affiliates in which we own of each venture and one joint venture agreement with a medical center affiliate in which we increased our ownership from to effective april  many of our patient populations have diseases that are discovered before or during adolescence and require ongoing care from physician specialists  many of whom are based at pediatric  academic and other acute care medical centers 
to date  these ventures have primarily derived revenues from the treatment of patients with hemophilia  growth hormone related disorders and respiratory syncytial virus 
we share profits and losses with our joint venture partners in equal proportion to our respective equity ownership 
we account for our interests in the net income or loss in our owned joint ventures under the equity method of accounting  and in our owned joint venture under the consolidated method of accounting 
our equity interest in the net income of these joint ventures represented approximately and of our income before income taxes for the years ended june  and  respectively 
in addition to joint venture relationships  we have a management agreement with one medical center for the provision of specialized contract pharmacy services 
we receive a management fee for these services  which we classify as other revenue 
costs of services include drug acquisition costs  pharmacy and warehouse personnel costs  freight and other direct costs associated with the delivery of our products and costs of clinical services provided 
general and administrative expenses include the personnel costs of the reimbursement  sales  marketing  administrative and support staffs as well as corporate overhead and other general expenses 
bad debts include our provision for patient accounts receivable which prove to be uncollectible after routine collection efforts have been exhausted 
we typically hire personnel and incur legal  recruiting  marketing and other expenses in anticipation of the commercial launch of a new biopharmaceutical drug 
in some instances  a portion of these expenses are reimbursed to us by the biopharmaceutical manufacturer 
we have not historically capitalized any of these start up expenses 
due to the increasing sensitivity to drug cost within governmental and non governmental payors  we are continuously susceptible to reimbursement and operating margin pressures 
in recent years  pharmacy benefit managers and other non governmental payors have aggressively attempted to discount their reimbursement rates for our products 
although this aggressive discounting has resulted in some reduced margins for our services  our agreements with biopharmaceutical manufacturers typically have provisions that address these discounts through adjustments in product acquisition cost 
these provisions have allowed us to remain price competitive while maintaining relatively stable operating margins 
many government payors  including medicare and medicaid  pay us directly or indirectly for some of the drugs that we sell at the drug s average wholesale price awp or a percentage discount off awp 
recent government investigations into the reporting of awp by drug manufacturers have lead first databank  inc to publish a market price survey of drugs that significantly reduces reimbursement for a number of the clotting factor products and ivig we sell 
a number of state medicaid agencies now pay us for clotting factor at the prices shown on the market price survey or at a percentage discount off those prices 
other states have not changed their pricing structure or have changed back to their pre market price survey reimbursement rates 
the health care financing administration hcfa has also announced that effective october   medicare intermediaries should calculate the amount that they pay for certain drugs by using the lower prices on the first databank market price survey 
the proposal to include clotting factor in the lower medicare pricing has been withdrawn 
instead  hcfa will seek legislation that would establish payments to cover the administrative costs of suppliers of clotting factor as a supplement to lower awp pricing for factor 
we estimate that reimbursements by medicare and state medicaid agencies make up approximately and  respectively  of our gross patient service revenues from drugs we handle that are covered by the market price survey 
we have seen an overall reduction in pricing and margins for clotting factor that we sell 
however  we cannot predict the eventual results of the government investigations and the changes made by first databank 
if the reduced average wholesale prices published by first databank for the drugs that we sell are ultimately adopted as the standard by which we are paid by government payors or private payors  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including reducing the pricing and margins on certain of our products

we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
the proceeds of the stock offering have been used to repay the outstanding principal balance of our revolving line of credit and will also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including possible acquisitions 
as of june  and june   we had working capital of million and million  respectively 
our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  these increases are due primarily to our revenue growth and the timing of the collection of receivables  inventory purchases and payments of accounts payable

the aggregate net proceeds from that offering of approximately million were used to pay costs of the offering  redeem all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock plus accrued dividends million  prepay in full all principal and accrued interest on our senior subordinated notes million and reduce the outstanding balance of our revolving line of credit million 
during fiscal year  we also received approximately million from the private sale of our common stock 
historically  we have funded our operations and continued internal growth through cash provided by operations 
capital expenditures amounted to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year we anticipate that our capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending june  will consist primarily of additional computer hardware and a fully integrated pharmacy and reimbursement software system to meet the needs of our growth 
we expect the cost of our capital expenditures in fiscal year to be approximately million  exclusive of any acquisitions of businesses  and expect to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from the planned stock offering and or borrowings under the revolving credit agreement with our bank 
in addition  in connection with three of our acquisitions that were completed in and  we may be obligated to make up to million in earn out payments during the next twelve months 
we have a million revolving credit facility under the terms of our existing credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains a million sub limit for working capital loans and letters of credit and is subject to a borrowing base limit that is based on our cash provided by operations 
all outstanding principal and interest on loans made under the credit agreement are due and payable on december  interest on loans under the credit agreement accrues at a variable rate index based on the prime rate or the london inter bank offered rate for one  two  three or six months as selected by us  plus a margin depending on the amount of our debt to cash flow ratio as defined by the credit agreement and measured at the end of each quarter for prospective periods

the payment schedule requires that all outstanding principal amounts in excess of million be paid on january   all outstanding principal amounts in excess of million be paid on july  and all remaining principal shall be paid in full on november  as of june   the partnership had million outstanding under the line of credit 
we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure under the credit agreement 
we have effectively converted  for the period through october   million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
we secured a fixed interest rate exclusive of the margin rate under our current interest rate swap agreement 
on august   in conjunction with the repayment of the outstanding principal balance of our revolving line of credit  we surrendered our swap agreement and received  in consideration for the early termination of the agreement 
while we anticipate that our cash from operations  along with the short term use of the revolving credit facility and the net proceeds received from the recent stock offering  will be sufficient to meet our internal operating requirements and growth plans for at least the next months  we expect that additional funds may be required in the future to successfully continue our growth beyond that month period or in the event that we grow more than expected within such period 
we may be required to raise additional funds through sales of equity or debt securities or seek additional financing from financial institutions 
there can be no assurance  however  that financing will be available on terms that are favorable to us or  if obtained  will be sufficient for our needs 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued  and is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  in june  sfas no 
was issued  deferring the effective date of sfas no 
for one year 
we expect to adopt statement no 
in fiscal year we do not anticipate that the adoption of statement no 
will have a significant effect on our results of operations or our financial position 
impact of inflation changes in prices charged by the biopharmaceutical manufacturers for the drugs we dispense  along with increasing labor costs  freight and supply costs and other overhead expenses  affect our cost of services and general and administrative expenses 
historically  we have been able to pass all  or a portion  of the effect of such increases to the biopharmaceutical manufacturers pursuant to negotiated adjustments made under our preferred distribution agreements 
as a result  changes due to inflation have not had significant adverse effects on our operations 
impact of year issues in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed the remediation and testing of our systems 
as a result of our planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no disruptions in our mission critical information technology and non information technology systems 
we believe these systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we are not aware of material problems resulting from year issues  either with our internal systems  our services or the products and services of third parties with whom we do business 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers throughout the year to ensure that any year issues that may arise are properly addressed 
forward looking information certain of the matters discussed in the preceding pages of this form k  particularly regarding implementation of our strategy  development of new drugs by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  anticipated growth and revenues  anticipated working capital and sources of funding for growth opportunities  expenditures  interest  costs and income  and the effects of year issues constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended see item risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to rising interest rates on our variable rate debt  primarily by entering into variable to fixed interest rate swaps 
since we have fixed our interest rate through october  on million of our revolving credit facility through such a financial instrument  we would not benefit from any decrease in interest rates on this portion of our credit facility 
accordingly  a basis point decrease in interest rates along the entire yield curve would not increase pre tax income by  for the year as would be expected without this financial instrument 
however  a basis point increase in interest rates along the entire yield curve would also not decrease pre tax income by  for the same period as a result of using this derivative financial instrument 
actual changes in rates may differ from the hypothetical assumptions used in computing this exposure 
on august   in conjunction with the repayment of the outstanding principal balance of our revolving line of credit  we terminated our swap agreement 
as a result of this action  we currently do not have any market risk associated with our revolving line of credit or a derivative financial instrument such as a swap agreement
