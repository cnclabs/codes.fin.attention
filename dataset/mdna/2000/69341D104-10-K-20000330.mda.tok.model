item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company offers placement  purchase and leasing alternatives to customers interested in acquiring the heart laser system 
the company has developed a strategy to address the challenges of marketing high cost capital equipment by offering the heart laser system on a usage basis to hospitals 
the particular structure of a usage based contract  including the length of contract  price billed per procedure and end of term options for purchase  depends primarily on whether the hospital is willing and able to commit to a certain minimum volume of procedures over a defined period of time 
if the hospital cannot commit to a sufficient number of procedures  the heart laser system may be installed with usage fees billed as agreed upon with the hospital 
the company refers to this type of usage arrangement as a retained placement contract 
under a retained placement contract  placement and service fee revenue is recorded over the term of the usage agreement and the heart laser system remains the property of the company and is depreciated over the term of the usage agreement 
if the hospital is willing and able to commit to a sufficient number of procedures such that the substantial risks and benefits of ownership of the heart laser system have transferred to the hospital  then the company classifies the usage agreement as a minimum procedure sales contract 
under a minimum procedure sales contract  the company records product revenue  at a discounted present value of the guaranteed minimum procedure payments  and records product cost of sale at the time of acceptance of the heart laser system 
the company believes that retained placement and minimum procedure sales contracts are appealing to hospitals when capital equipment funds are scarce or unavailable or when it is difficult to predict early usage as is the case with new technology such as tmr 
the company s financing arrangements with leasing vendors enables the company to monetize future payment streams associated with certain agreements 
if utilization becomes more predictable  the company expects a significant number of new accounts to opt for conventional leasing  or direct purchase 
the heart laser system is also sold to customers  and the related sterile handpieces and other disposables are sold separately for each procedure 
these sales are classified as product sales 
customers are given the option to purchase service contracts to cover the cost of maintaining the heart laser system beyond the applicable warranty period 
these service revenues are recorded ratably over the service contract and are classified as a component of placement and service fees 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues of  for the year ended december  increased  or when compared to total revenues of  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   product sales of  increased  or when compared to product sales of  for the year ended december  the major factors in both increases are primarily due to the periods reflecting increased sales of the heart laser system and related disposables due to the company s receipt of fda approval to market the heart laser system in august  as well as license and royalty fees associated with the cardiogenesis settlement 
placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  increased from placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  in may  the health care financing administration hcfa instituted a non coverage policy for transmyocardial revascularization tmr procedures performed on medicare patients in the united states 
the hcfa announcement  coupled with delays in the fda pre market approval pma process  caused the company to examine its contractual requirements during and amend substantially all of its retained placement contracts  temporarily replacing contractual minimum billings with actual usage billings 
following approval of the pma by the fda on august   the company renegotiated usage agreements with its customers on a case by case basis 
the period reflects revenue from these retained placement contracts with the renegotiated usage agreements following fda approval 
the period reflects revenue primarily from retained placement contracts with actual usage billings 
total gross profit increased to  or of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared with the gross profit of  or of total revenues for the year ended december  in the period  the company did not generate sufficient sales volume to efficiently cover manufacturing costs  resulting in lower gross margins 
in  gross margins improved as a result of an increase in sales volumes and manufacturing cost reductions implemented by the company 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared with expenses of  for the year ended december  this reduction is primarily due to a restructuring of the company s workforce in april the periods reflect reduced headcount and compensation and related benefits related to the reduced workforce 
research and development expenditures of  decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared with expenditures of  for the year ended december  the decreases in compared to reflect the reduced demands for clinical study compilation and data preparation following the fda approval for the heart laser system in august in addition  in april  the company reduced its workforce  and the periods reflect reduced headcount and compensation and related benefits related to the reduced workforce 
other income of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to other income of  for the year ended december   primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower average cash balances in as compared to there was no provision for income tax for the years ended december  or due to the net losses of  and  respectively 
the company incurred a net loss for the year ended december  of  compared with a net loss of  for the year ended december  the smaller net loss resulted from higher total revenues and higher gross margin dollars coupled with lower overall operating expenses in when compared with year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to total revenues of  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   product sales of  decreased  or when compared to product sales of  for the year ended december  the major factor in these decreases is the decline in the number of sales transactions in in  the company recorded revenue on six sales compared with revenue recognition on ten sales in placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  decreased from placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  although the company increased the number of its retained placement contracts in  revenue from these contracts decreased 
in may  hcfa instituted a non coverage policy for tmr procedures performed on medicare patients in the united states 
the hcfa announcement  coupled with delays in the fda pma process  caused the company to examine its contractual requirements during and amend substantially all of its retained placement contracts  temporarily replacing contractual minimal billings with actual usage billings 
following receipt of the pma from the fda on august   the company renegotiated usage agreements with the customer based on a case by case basis 
total gross profit decreased to  or of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared with total gross profit of  or of total revenues for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from three factors 
first  the decrease in revenue in generated fewer gross margin dollars as compared to second  the company produced fewer of the heart laser systems than planned in  resulting in unfavorable manufacturing variances 
these unfavorable manufacturing variances would continue until production increases to levels which will fully absorb manufacturing overhead 
third  depreciation on the heart laser systems shipped pursuant to placement contracts increased at a greater rate than the corresponding revenue generated from placement contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  increased  or when compared with expenses of  for the year ended december  the increase in reflects sales and marketing expenses incurred to initiate rapid commercialization of the heart laser system upon receipt of the pma 
research and development expenditures of  decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared with expenditures of  for the year ended december  the decrease in compared to reflects the reduced demands for clinical study compilation and data preparation following the fda panel recommendation of approval for the heart laser system  offset in part by higher costs associated with the development of new products 
other income of  for the year ended december  increased  or when compared to other income of  for the year ended december   primarily because of gains recorded in connection with foreign currency transactions 
there was no provision for income tax for the years ended december  or due to the net losses of  and  respectively 
the company incurred a net loss for the year ended december  of  compared with a net loss of  for the year ended december  the larger net loss resulted from lower total revenues and lower gross margin dollars in when compared with liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of over the past three years  the company incurred significant operating losses and utilized significant amounts of cash to fund operations 
the company is in a critical stage in its growth as it continues to transition from a research and development company to a commercial company with complete sales  marketing and production capabilities 
during  the company implemented a number of programs to reduce its consumption of cash  including operating expense reductions and establishment of third party financing alliances to enable the company to obtain an upfront cash payment on certain of its minimum procedure sales contracts 
in april  the company announced a workforce restructuring to further reduce operating expenses and concentrate the company s resources on its sales efforts 
the restructuring eliminated of the positions within the company as of april  during  the company also sold  shares of common stock resulting in proceeds to the company net of all issuance costs of approximately  to fund working capital requirements 
most recently  on march   the company closed an equity financing with two institutional investors at per share 
in conjunction with this offer  the company sold  shares of common stock  resulting in proceeds to the company net of all issuance costs of approximately  and issued the placement agent a three year warrant for  shares of common stock at per share 
the company may seek additional financing through the issuance and sale of debt or equity securities  bank financing  joint ventures or by other means 
the availability of such financing and the reasonableness of any related terms in comparison to market conditions cannot be assured 
while the company is encouraged by recent developments with respect to fda approval and medicare coverage for tmr procedures  the historical absence of widespread reimbursement for the tmr procedure by third party payers has limited demand for and use of the heart laser system 
although medicare reimbursement began in july  and some private insurance plans have begun reimbursing health care providers for tmr procedures using the heart laser system  the company believes that operating losses are likely to continue until such time as third party payers begin to provide widespread reimbursement to healthcare providers for use of the heart laser system 
management believes that its existing cash resources and cash from operations will meet working capital requirements over the next twelve months 
however  unanticipated decreases in operating revenues  increases in expenses or further delays in the process of third party payers providing reimbursement to healthcare providers  may adversely impact the company s cash position and require further cost reductions or the need to obtain additional financing 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in achieving broad commercial acceptance of the heart laser system or that the company will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis 
should additional financing not be available on terms and conditions acceptable to the company  additional actions may be required that could adversely impact the company s ability to continue to realize assets and satisfy liabilities in the normal course of business 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of these uncertainties 
during the year ended december   the company incurred a net loss of  which resulted in the use of approximately  to support operations 
cash used by investing activities was approximately  and primarily related to plc s retained placement contract activity 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  and primarily related to the net proceeds of  obtained from the sale of the company s common stock   in secured borrowings  offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations of  at december   the company had us net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to reduce future taxable income  which expire at various dates through  and the company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
in addition  various other deferred tax assets have been generated related primarily to intercompany profit  accruals  and research and development tax credits 
because the company believes that  as of december   it is more likely than not  that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  no tax benefit for prior year losses and other deferred items has been provided 
these amounts could provide a benefit to the company in the future in profitable years  subject to the expirations noted 
the company and certain of its officers have been named as defendants in purported class action lawsuits filed between august and november see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
year in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company did not incur material expenses in in connection with remediating its systems to become year ready 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors through the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed completely 
risk factors our company has a history of operating losses plc systems inc was founded in we have incurred operating losses in every year of our existence except we have incurred net losses of  for the year ended december    for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur net losses for at least the next fiscal year 
moreover  although our business is not seasonal in nature  our revenues tend to vary significantly from fiscal quarter to fiscal quarter 
our company is dependent on one principal product we develop and market one principal product a patented high powered carbon dioxide laser system known as the heart laser system and related disposables 
approximately of our revenue in the fiscal year ended december  and in the fiscal year ended december  was derived from the heart laser system 
our company may be unable to raise needed funds as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  a decrease of  from the balance of  we had as of december  based on our current operating plan  we anticipate that our existing capital resources  together with cash from operations  should be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements over the next twelve months 
if our business does not progress in accordance with our current business plan  we may need to raise additional funds 
we are currently exploring a number of alternatives to raise additional capital 
we may not be able to raise additional capital upon satisfactory terms or at all  and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible securities  ownership dilution to our stockholders will result 
in order to compete effectively  the heart laser system needs to gain commercial acceptance the heart laser system is designed for use in the treatment of coronary artery disease in a surgical laser procedure we pioneered known as transmyocardial revascularization 
transmyocardial revascularization is commonly referred to in our industry as tmr 
tmr is a new technology that is only recently becoming known 
we may never achieve widespread commercial acceptance 
to be successful  we need to demonstrate to the medical community in general  and to heart surgeons and cardiologists in particular  that tmr procedures and the heart laser system are effective  relatively safe and cost effective  train heart surgeons to perform tmr procedures using the heart laser system  and obtain widespread insurance reimbursement for the tmr procedure 
to date  we have trained only a limited number of heart surgeons and will need to expand our marketing and training capabilities 
although the heart laser system has received fda approval and the ce mark  it has not yet received widespread commercial acceptance 
if we are unable to maintain regulatory approvals or to achieve widespread commercial acceptance of the heart laser system  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
results of long term clinical studies may adversely affect our business patients have only been treated with the heart laser system since january  and  as a result  there have been few long term follow up studies 
if patients suffer harmful  long term consequences from the heart laser system  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
rapid technological changes in our industry could make the heart laser system obsolete our industry is characterized by rapid technological change and intense competition 
new technologies and products and new industry standards will develop at a rapid pace 
they could make the heart laser system obsolete 
the advent of new devices and procedures and advances in new drugs and genetic engineering are especially threatening 
our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce product enhancements to address the needs of our customers 
material delays in introducing product enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our product and purchase those of our competitors 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and are in a better financial position to exploit marketing and research and development opportunities 
our competitors products use different types of lasers than we use in the heart laser system  including holmium and excimer lasers that may gain more widespread market acceptance than the heart laser system 
in addition  we believe that several companies are attempting to develop less invasive methods of performing tmr procedures 
these new methods may eliminate the need to make an incision in the patient s chest  reducing costs and speeding recovery 
these new technologies and methods may erode the potential tmr market  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must receive and maintain government approval in order to market our product general the heart laser system and our manufacturing activities are subject to extensive  rigorous and changing federal and state regulation in the united states and to similar regulatory requirements in other major markets  including the european community and japan 
to date  we have received regulatory approval in the united states and have the ability to market the heart laser system in the european community excluding france 
we have not received regulatory approval in japan 
without regulatory approval  we cannot market the heart laser system in japan 
even if granted  regulations may significantly restrict the use of the heart laser system 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approval is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
united states although we have received fda approval  the fda has restricted the use of the heart laser system and could reverse its approval at any time in august  we received fda approval to market a laser system for tmr procedures 
however  the fda has not allowed us to market the heart laser system to treat patients whose condition is amenable to conventional treatments  such as heart bypass surgery and angioplasty  and could reverse its ruling and prohibit use of the heart laser system at any time 
europe although we have the ability to market our product in the european community  the members of the european community could  and france has  prohibited commercial use of the heart laser system the heart laser system received the ce mark from the european community in however the european community could reverse its ruling and prohibit use of the heart laser system at any time  we cannot market the heart laser system in france  and other european community countries could prohibit or restrict use of the heart laser system 
despite receiving the ce mark  the french ministry of health instituted a commercial moratorium on tmr procedures in october in its opinion  the procedure is considered to be experimental and should only be performed within the context of a clinical study 
an evaluation of the safety of the heart laser system is currently under review by a panel of french experts 
there can be no assurance that this moratorium will be lifted on a timely basis or at all 
asia we cannot market our product in major asian markets until we receive government approval we believe that japan represents the largest potential market for the heart laser system in asia 
prior to marketing the heart laser system in japan  we must receive approval from the japanese government 
this approval requires a clinical study in japan with at least patients 
this study was completed in although the results of this study have been submitted to the japanese government  we do not know whether the clinical study will be sufficient or when  if ever  we will receive approval to sell the heart laser system in japan 
additional regulatory applications are pending in taiwan 
we cannot be sure when  if at all  we will obtain regulatory approval in any particular country 
asserting and defending intellectual property rights may impact our results of operations in our industry  competitors often assert intellectual property infringement claims against one another 
the success of our business depends on our ability to successfully defend our intellectual property 
future litigation may have a material impact on our financial condition even if we are successful in marketing the heart laser system 
we may not be successful in defending or asserting our intellectual property rights 
an adverse outcome in any litigation or interference proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to cease using the technology that is at issue or to license the technology from third parties 
in addition  a finding that any of our intellectual property is invalid could allow our competitors to more easily and cost effectively compete with us 
thus  an unfavorable outcome in any patent litigation or interference proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or interference proceeding could be substantial 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or interference proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace 
patent litigation and interference proceedings may also absorb significant management time 
we may be subject to product liability lawsuits  our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages we may be subject to product liability claims 
the united states supreme court has stated that compliance with fda regulations will not shield a company from common law negligent design claims or manufacturing and labeling claims based on state rules 
such claims may absorb significant management time and could degrade the reputation of plc and the marketability of the heart laser system 
if product liability claims are made with respect to our products  we may need to recall the implicated product which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  although we maintain product liability insurance with a per claim and yearly aggregate maximum of million  subject to a  per occurrence and  aggregate self insured deductible  we cannot be sure that our insurance will be adequate to cover potential product liability lawsuits 
our insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if a successful product liability claim or series of claims exceeded our insurance coverage  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on certain suppliers we believe that some of the components for our laser systems  most notably the laser head  may only be available from one or a limited number of suppliers 
any interruption in supply from these suppliers could prevent us from meeting commercial demands for the heart laser system  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with international operations a portion of our product sales are generated from operations outside of the united states 
establishing and expanding international sales can be expensive 
managing and overseeing foreign operations may be difficult and products may not receive market acceptance 
risks of doing business outside the us include the following agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign country s legal system  foreign customers may have longer payment cycles  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax plc s foreign income  impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  us export licenses may be difficult to obtain  and the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce 
there can be no assurance that our international business will grow or that any of the foregoing risks will not result in a material adverse effect on plc 
we have been sued for alleged violations of securities law in july  an fda advisory panel recommended against approval of our application to market the heart laser system 
following this recommendation  we were named as defendant in purported class action lawsuits filed between august and november in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts 
the lawsuits seek an unspecified amount of damages in connection with alleged violations of the federal securities laws based on our failure to obtain a favorable fda panel recommendation in nineteen of these complaints have been consolidated by the court into a single action for pretrial purposes and two suits were voluntarily dismissed 
the company moved to dismiss all of the remaining claims 
on march   the court issued an order dismissing some  but not all of the remaining claims 
the parties both filed motions for reconsideration and on october   the court dismissed additional  but not all remaining claims 
we cannot make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of these lawsuits 
we may not be able to pay the amount of any judgment against us 
an unfavorable outcome in this litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
because we are incorporated in canada  you may not be able to enforce judgments against us and our canadian directors under canadian law  you may not be able to enforce a judgment issued by courts in the united states against us or our canadian directors 
the status of the law in canada is unclear as to whether a us citizen can enforce a judgment from a us court in canada for violations of us securities laws 
a separate suit may need to be brought directly in canada 
antitakeover provisions may prevent you from realizing a premium return provisions of canadian law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to you 
specifically  canadian law requires any person who makes a tender offer that would increase the person s stock ownership to more than of our outstanding common stock to make a tender offer for all of our common stock 
these provisions could prevent you from realizing the premium return that stockholders may realize in conjunction with corporate takeovers 
in addition  the company has three classes of directors  with approximately one third elected each year for a three year term 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a corporate takeover or a change in our management 
this could adversely affect the market price of your common stock 
the market price of our stock may fall if other stockholders sell their stock if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a price we deem appropriate 
the value of your common stock may decrease if other security holders exercise their options and warrants as shown in the table below  we have reserved an additional  shares of common stock for future issuance upon exercise or conversion of outstanding options and redeemable warrants 
range of weighted shares reserved exercise average exercise for future conversion prices conversion price issuance options  redeemable warrants  total  we may issue additional options and warrants in the future 
if any of these securities are exercised  you may experience significant dilution in the market value and earnings per share of your common stock 
we have no intention to pay dividends we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain all future earnings  if any  for use in our business and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements this annual report and information incorporated by reference contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements deal with our current plans and expectations and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of the company s operations consists of sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
the company manufactures its products exclusively in the united states and sells the products in the united states and abroad 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
the company s operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies  especially the swiss franc and the german mark 
when the us dollar strengthens against the franc or mark  the value of nonfunctional currency sales decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the functional currency amount of sales increases 
overall  the company s support of its foreign operations results in a benefit of a stronger us dollar  but is adversely affected by a weaker us dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
the company does not believe that its exposure is significant 
the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents as well as interest paid on its debt
