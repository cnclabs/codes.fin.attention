the credit agreement provides for a blanket lien on all material assets of the company and a pledge of the capital stock of all the company s material subsidiaries  as well as upstream guarantees from all such subsidiaries 
the credit agreement restricts the company and its subsidiaries ability to take certain actions  including incurring additional indebtedness or altering the company s current method of doing business 
the credit agreement also contains certain financial covenants and ratios that may have the effect of restricting the company s ability to take certain actions in light of their impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations

the company s cash flow from operations on a long term basis is dependent on the receipt of funds from the title iv programs

the hea and its implementing regulations establish specific standards of financial responsibility  administrative capability and other requirements that must be satisfied in order to qualify for participation in the title iv programs 
the doe requires that title iv program funds collected by an institution for unbilled tuition be kept in separate cash or cash equivalent accounts until the students are billed for the portion of their program related to these title iv program funds 
in addition  all funds transferred to the company through electronic funds transfer programs are held in a separate cash account until certain conditions are satisfied

on september   john marshall filed an appeal regarding its accreditation  which is scheduled to be heard in february  if the appeal is successful  the company has been advised that the aba will send a two person team to inspect the school and verify that shortcomings noted in previous inspections have been addressed 
if the appeal proves unsuccessful  john marshall can begin the accreditation process again with a new application filing in the fall of though the company believes that accreditation can be achieved before the deadline  there exist a myriad of circumstances that cannot be foreseen and over which the company has no control that could interfere with the granting of accreditation status to john marshall  thus  there can be no assurance that accreditation will be received which could impact the company s ability to recover its million advance to john marshall 
the company adopted a repurchase program for the company s class a common stock of up to  shares 
shares of class a common stock will be purchased by the company from time to time through open market purchases and private purchase  as available 
under this program  the company has repurchased  shares as of august  at a total cost of approximately  year problem the year problem is the potential for computer processing errors resulting from the use of computer programs that have been written using two digits  rather than four  to denote a year eg  using the digits to denote 
computer programs using this nomenclature can misidentify references to dates after as meaning dates early in the twentieth century eg  rather than 
the year problem is commonly considered to be prevalent in computer programs written as recently as the mid s  and can cause such programs to generate erroneous information  to otherwise malfunction or to cease operations altogether 
the company has installed a new management information system in its corporate headquarters 
in addition  the company s schools each have stand alone computer systems and networks for internal use and for communication with its students and with corporate headquarters 
since january   there have been no material adverse affects related to the year problem 
however  there can be no assurance that this new computer system will not still be affected by the year problem and that the company s existing systems will not still be affected by the year problem  or that a failure of any other parties  such as the doe or other government agencies on which the company depends for student financial assistance or the financial institutions involved in the processing of student loans  to address the year problem will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
in particular  there can be no assurance that malfunctions relating to the year problem will not result in the misreporting of financial information by the company 
the company has made inquiries of substantially all of its material vendors regarding the year problem and has not detected any significant issues relating to the year problem 
however  the company has not made a formal assessment of the computer programs used by government agencies or other first parties with which the company interacts  or an assessment of its own vulnerability to the failure of such programs to be free of the year problem 
the company does not have any formal contingency plans relating to the year problem 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario for the company regarding the year problem is a failure of the doe to adequately ensure payment of financial aid amounts 
the amendments require the doe to take steps to ensure that the processing  delivery and administration of grant  loan and work assistance provided under the title iv programs are not interrupted because of the year problem 
this legislation also authorizes the doe to postpone certain hea requirements to avoid overburdening institutions and disrupting the delivery of student financial assistance as a consequence of this problem 
to date  we do not believe that the doe has experienced any disruptions associated with the year problem  and our students have not experienced any delays in tuition payments as a result of the year problem 
there can be no assurance  however  that assistance will not be interrupted or that any doe requirements would be postponed so that there would be no material adverse effect on the company s schools
