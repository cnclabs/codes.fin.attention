results of operations summary the company reported net losses of million for the year ended december   as compared to net losses of million for the year ended december  the decrease in losses of million in as compared to is due to an increase in earnings in the core bank operations of million and a decrease in losses of million in the credit card operations 
the increase in earnings of the core bank operations was primarily the result of decreased operating expenses of million due to the elimination of a number of business initiatives  increased noninterest income of million primarily due to a gain on the sale of two branches  and lower income tax expense 
these positive variances were offset by lower net interest income of million due to a reduction in interest earning assets in the decrease in losses of the credit card operations was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income of million due to both higher balances of credit cards outstanding and a higher net interest margin and an increase in noninterest income of million due  also  to higher balances of credit cards outstanding 
these positive variances were offset by increases in provisions for estimated loan losses due to higher delinquencies and charge offs and increased operating expenses due to the increase in the average number of credit cards serviced 
the decrease in earnings of million in  as compared to is primarily due to the million of losses incurred in the credit card operations in  as compared to earnings of million in offset by a million decrease in minority interest in the credit card operations losses were primarily the result of a million increase in provisions for estimated loan losses due to higher delinquencies and charge offs 
net interest income and noninterest income net of operating expenses were million higher in than in due to the significant increase in the number and balance of credit cards outstanding 
business segments the following table shows the net income or loss for the core bank operations and the credit card operations for the periods indicated 
in computing net interest income  funding costs are charged to the credit card operations based on a rolling twelve month average of one year fixed rate fhlb advances

the segment earnings reported in the table do not include preferred dividends paid to holders of the preferred stock issued by fidelity federal bank 
these dividends are reported as minority interest in subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements and were  in and and million in core bank operations during and  a number of business initiatives outside of the existing retail branch system were undertaken in the core bank operations 
these included a financial education program for members of calpers  electronic commerce activities  a planned name change  an indirect auto lending program and a mall branch strategy 
as a result of the disappointing results of these programs and of the credit card operations  changes were made in the company s executive management and in the core bank operations strategic plan during the fourth quarter of under the revised strategic plan  the core bank operations are focused on the retail branch system and the establishment of mortgage origination operations 
in addition  as a consequence of its efforts to augment the bank s regulatory capital ratios  the core bank operations total assets decreased by billion from june  to december  net interest income for was million as compared to million for decreases in average interest earning assets of were for the most part offset by improvements in the interest margin produced by the bank s deposit repricing strategy and decreases in wholesale borrowings  which increased the net yield on interest earning assets to for from for the negative provisions for loan losses of million and million in and  respectively  represent net recoveries of specific valuation reserves and reduced estimates of future loan losses resulting from the continuing improvement in the asset quality of the bank s mortgage loan portfolio 
operating expenses decreased to million in from million in primarily due to changes in the bank s strategic plan in which resulted in the discontinuance of a number of business initiatives including electronic commerce activities  as well as other expense reduction efforts 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in saif assessments in the million decrease in net interest income between and reflects the decrease in the net yield to from offset by a increase in the average balance of interest earning assets 
the net yield decreased due to the use of higher costing cds and fhlb advances to fund the increase in interest earning assets  higher prepayments on the mbs portfolio causing an increased amortization of the purchase premiums and the amortization of losses incurred in the second quarter of on the hedging program for fixed rate mbs 
these were partially offset by a lower average balance of npls 
the increases in the average balances of interest earning assets are due to increases in mbs and the short term investment portfolios 
the negative provision for loan losses of million in as compared to the provision for loan losses of million represents net recoveries of specific valuation reserves and reduced estimates of loan losses in resulting from the significant improvement in the asset quality of the bank s mortgage loan portfolio 
noninterest income increased by million to million for from million for components of the increase in noninterest income in from include a an increase in automated teller machine atm cash services income of million  which was due to higher cash balances outstanding for the period based on a higher number of atms serviced  b decreased real estate operations costs of million primarily due to improved execution of reo sales and a lower volume of foreclosed properties  c an increase in investment products and loan fee income of million due to a higher sales volumes  and d lower losses on securities activities of million  which represented hedge losses on the mbs portfolio of million offset by gains on the sale of securities and recoveries related to past loan securitizations 
these favorable variances were offset by million in prepayment expenses on the early repayment of fhlb advances related to the bank s efforts to augment the bank s regulatory capital ratios by reducing assets 
operating expenses increased by million to million for compared to for the increase in expenses was due primarily to costs associated with new business initiatives 
the calpers  mall branch strategy  internet bank and other projects contributed million to the increase in operating expenses for credit card operations cards issued and balances outstanding under the credit card programs  which the bank began in  grew rapidly in the second and third quarters of after which the bank curtailed the origination of new accounts due to the very disappointing performance of the credit card portfolio 
since that time the company has concentrated on reducing the operating losses from the credit card operations  which decreased to million in from million in net interest income for increased to million from million in primarily due to higher average earning asset balances of million in compared to million in the prior year  and an increase in the interest margin to in from in as a result of the termination of the agreement with adc in november  the bank became entitled to all of the interest from the related portfolio which increased the gross yield for that portfolio 
this change along with a change in the composition of the balances of the respective credit card programs resulted in the increase in net yield in the increase in the provision for estimated loan losses to million for from million in was primarily a result of increases in delinquencies in the adc portfolio in the second quarter of  the impact of which more than offset both the decrease in total balances outstanding and the improving delinquency trends in the other programs in the portfolio 
credit card fees increased to million in from million in the prior year due to an increase in the average number of accounts outstanding 
included in credit card fees are origination fees net of origination costs and annual fees  which are deferred and amortized into income over a month period  interchange fees  late payment fees and other ancillary fees 
credit card origination costs represented marketing fees paid to mmg to originate cards under the mmg credit card program 
during and  the company recognized million and million of net origination fees 
at december   there were no deferred net origination fees to be amortized into income 
operating expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily reflecting higher servicing costs due to the higher average number of accounts serviced in due in part to the transfer of servicing of the adc portfolio to the bank at the beginning of the change in all earnings components for as compared to reflects the increase in the average balance of credit cards outstanding  which increased from million in when the credit card portfolio was started to million in in addition  the credit cards originated in were under the credit enhancement programs  where the credit card marketers received all credit card revenues and were responsible for credit losses and operating expenses  including a cost of funds charge paid to the bank 
the increase in provisions for estimated loan losses of million for as compared to  was primarily due to increasing delinquencies and charge offs in the rapidly growing credit card portfolio 
credit card balances were million as compared to million  and delinquencies were as compared to at december  and december   respectively 
credit card charge offs were million in  including million of loans purchased by marketers of the credit enhancement credit card programs  with no comparable amounts in net interest income the following tables present the primary determinants of net interest income for the periods indicated

the following tables present the dollar amount of changes in interest income and expense for each major component of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the amount of change attributable to changes in average balances and average rates for the periods indicated 
because of numerous changes in both balances and rates  it is difficult to allocate precisely the effects thereof 
for purposes of these tables  the change due to volume is initially calculated as the change in average balance multiplied by the average rate during the prior period and the change due to rate is calculated as the change in average rate multiplied by the average volume during the prior period 
any change that remains unallocated after such calculations is allocated proportionately to changes in volume and changes in rates

 the recognition of a deferred tax asset is dependent upon a more likely than not expectation of realization of the deferred tax asset  based upon the analysis of available evidence 
a valuation allowance is required to sufficiently reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is expected to be realized on a more likely than not basis 
the analysis of available evidence is performed each quarter utilizing the more likely than not criteria to determine the amount  if any  of the deferred tax asset to be realized 
adjustments to the valuation allowance are made accordingly 
there can be no assurance that the company will recognize additional portions of the deferred tax asset in future periods or that additional valuation allowances may not be recorded in future periods

internal revenue code irc sections and and the treasury regulations thereunder generally provide for limitations on the ability of a corporation to utilize net operating loss nol or credit carryforwards to offset taxable income or reduce its tax liability in taxable years following a change of control 
in addition  the rules restrict the ability of a corporation to recognize certain losses during the first five years after a change of control if the losses existed  but were not recognized  as of the date of the change of control 
in general  the annual limitation with respect to these items is determined by computing the product of the fair market value of the corporation immediately prior to the change of control and the federal long term tax exempt interest rate in effect at that time  as prescribed by the irs

at december   of fidelity s real estate loan portfolio consisted of california single family residences to units  while consisted of california multifamily dwellings of or more units 
because of the company s mortgage loan portfolio is secured by properties located in southern california  the performance of the company s loans are particularly susceptible to the potential for declines in the southern california economy  such as increasing vacancy rates  declining rents  increasing interest rates  declining debt coverage ratios  and declining market values for single family  multifamily and commercial properties 
in addition  the possibility that borrowers may abandon properties or seek bankruptcy protection with respect to income properties experiencing negative cash flow  particularly where such properties are not cross collateralized by other performing assets  can also adversely affect portfolio performance

 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructuring  a troubled debt restructuring tdr occurs when a creditor  for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor s difficulties  grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider 
generally  fidelity restructures loans by temporarily or permanently reducing interest rates  allowing interest only payments  reducing the loan balance  extending property tax repayment plans  extending maturity dates or recasting principal and interest payments

the company maintains an allowance for credit losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
these allowances consist of svas and an alll which are based on ongoing  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
in addition  the company s allowances incorporate the results of measuring impaired loans as provided in o sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies o sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and o sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
these accounting standards prescribe the measurement methods  income recognition and disclosures concerning impaired loans 
an sva is established where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a specific loan that management believes indicate the probability that a loss has been incurred 
the alll is established to provide for credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio other than those provided for in svas 
the alll is computed utilizing several models and methodologies which are based upon a number of factors  including historical delinquency and loss experience  the level of nonperforming and internally classified loans  the composition of the loan portfolio  estimated remaining lives of the various types of loans within the portfolio  prevailing and forecasted economic conditions and management s judgment 
for small dollar value homogeneous loans such as consumer installment loans  residential mortgages and credit card loans  the company utilizes computations based on various factors  including past loss experience  recent economic events and current conditions and portfolio delinquency rates 
for loans or groups of loans for which the company has little or no loss experience of its own  the company utilizes the loss experience for similar types of loans of other enterprises 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the alll consists of o a calculated component  and o a judgmental component the calculated component of the alll at december   was determined as follows o single family mortgage loans units delinquency migration models were utilized which apply delinquency and loss factors to the outstanding portfolio segregated by delinquency status 
the delinquency and loss factors are based on delinquency migration results of the company s single family loan portfolio for the most recent twelve months  or  in the case of nonconforming mortgage loans  are based on the delinquency and loss experience for similar types of loans of other enterprises 
estimated charge offs in are expected to be million 
o multifamily mortgage loans and commercial and industrial real estate loans graded pass or special mention loss factors were applied to outstanding loan balances based on the internal risk grade of those loans or pools of loans 
these loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience over the last two years derived from the classification migration model 
estimated charge offs in are expected to be million 
o multifamily and commercial industrial real estate loans graded substandard an estimated allowance was computed for each loan based on the estimated value of the underlying collateral of each loan as compared to its carrying value 
estimated charge offs in are expected to be million 
o credit card loans originated under the adc and mmg agreements the company utilized a delinquency migration model that applies delinquency migration factors to the outstanding portfolio segregated by delinquency status 
the delinquency migration model assumes the continuation of historical delinquency patterns from current accounts to charge off 
estimated charge offs in are expected to be million 
o credit card loans originated under other programs delinquency migration models based on the related credit card portfolios specific experience were utilized 
estimated charge offs in are expected to be million and are expected to be covered by the cash deposits and guarantees of credit enhanced credit card program marketers 
o all other loans loss factors were applied to the outstanding loan balances 
these loss factors were based on the company s historical experience or the loss experience for similar types of loans of other enterprises 
estimated charge offs in are expected to be million 
loans with svas are excluded from the computation of alll 
the judgmental component is based upon management s evaluation of various conditions  the effects of which are not directly measured in determining sva or the calculated component 
the evaluation of the inherent loss regarding these conditions involves a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the judgmental component include the following conditions o level of inherent uncertainty in the precision of the calculated component  o general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  o credit quality trends  including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  o recent trends in collateral values  o loan volumes and concentrations  o seasoning of the loan portfolios  o specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  o recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  o duration of the current business cycle  and o quality of loan review and credit oversight systems o experience of lending personnel executive management reviews these conditions quarterly 
if any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit as of the evaluation date  management s estimate of the effect of this condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to this credit 
where any of these conditions are not evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit as of the evaluation date  management s evaluation of the probable loss concerning this condition is reflected in the judgmental component 
the credit enhanced credit card programs require the marketing agent  as part of their contractual obligation to reimburse fidelity for credit losses  to maintain cash deposits with fidelity 
these cash deposits are deducted from the computed amount of estimated future credit losses in determining the required levels of alll and are considered part of the reserves available to cover future credit losses 
in addition  the bank does not provide for estimated credit losses in excess of cash deposits for the credit enhanced credit card programs if a determination is made that the bank can rely on the marketer for payment of future credit losses 
the company s allowance for credit losses is based upon estimates of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of losses actually incurred can vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the company s methodology includes several features that are intended to reduce the difference between estimated and actual losses 
the migration models that are used are designed to be self correcting by taking into account the company s recent delinquency and loss experience 
pooled loan loss factors are adjusted quarterly based upon the level of net charge offs expected by management in the next twelve months 
furthermore  the company s methodology permits adjustments to any loss factor used in the computation of the formula allowance in the event that  in management s judgment  significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date are not reflected in the loss factors 
by assessing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis  the company is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates based upon any more recent information that has become available 
the company believes its policies and procedures for establishing the allowance for credit losses and for providing provisions for estimated loan losses are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  including sfas no 
 sfas no 
 sfas no 
and regulatory standards established by the ots 
the allowance for loan losses does not represent the amount of losses that could be incurred under adverse conditions that management does not consider to be the most likely to arise 
in addition  management s classification of assets and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is an ongoing process 
consequently  there can be no assurance that material additions to the bank s allowance for loan losses will not be required in the future  thereby adversely affecting earnings and the bank s ability to maintain or build capital 
regulatory capital compliance the ots capital regulations  as required by firrea include three separate minimum capital requirements for the savings institution industry a tangible capital requirement  a leverage limit and a risk based capital requirement 
these capital standards must be no less stringent than the capital standards applicable to national banks 
the bank s actual and required capital are as follows at the dates indicated minimum to be well capitalized under minimum prompt corrective actual capital requirement action provision amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio dollars in thousands as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets    core capital to adjusted tangible assets    tangible capital to tangible assets   n a core capital to risk weighted assets  n a  as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets    core capital to adjusted tangible assets    tangible capital to tangible assets   n a core capital to risk weighted assets  n a  the following table reconciles the company s stockholders equity and the bank s capital in accordance with gaap to the bank s tangible  core and risk based capital at the dates indicated tangible core risk based capital capital capital dollars in thousands as of december  consolidated stockholders equity    adjustments fidelity s preferred stock    bank plus equity excluding fidelity    fidelity s stockholders equity    accumulated other comprehensive loss    adjustments intangible assets    nonincludable subsidiaries excess alll  net deferred tax assets    regulatory capital    as of december  consolidated stockholders equity    adjustments fidelity s preferred stock    bank plus equity excluding fidelity    fidelity s stockholders equity    accumulated other comprehensive loss    adjustments intangible assets    nonincludable subsidiaries excess alll  regulatory capital    as of december   the bank was well capitalized under the pca regulations adopted by the ots pursuant to fdicia 
as of december   the most constraining of the capital ratio measurements was risk based capital to risk weighted assets which had an excess of million above the minimum level required to be considered well capitalized 
the bank s capital amounts and classification are subject to review by federal regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
due to the expectation of continuing losses in the credit card operations  or a significant write down in the carrying value of the credit card portfolios as a result of the adoption of alternative strategies  the bank expects to be adequately capitalized in liquidity the bank derives funds from deposits  fhlb advances  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and other short term and long term borrowings 
in addition  funds are generated from loan payments and payoffs as well as from the sale of loans and investments 
deposits the largest source of funds for the company is deposits 
customer deposits are insured by the fdic to the maximum amount permitted by law up to  per account 
the company has several types of deposit accounts designed to attract both short term and long term deposits 
at december   the company had deposits of billion 
the following table presents the distribution of deposit accounts at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands passbook accounts   checking accounts   money market savings accounts   total transaction accounts   cds   total deposits   there were no brokered deposits outstanding at december  and the following table summarizes cds by remaining maturity and weighted average rate at december  remaining term to maturity greater less than to to than months months months months total dollars in thousands cds less than       greater than       total cds      weighted average yield less than  greater than  total weighted average yield on cds the following table provides information with regards to the bank s most recent quarterly experience in the levels of and pricing of cds for the period indicated weighted average rate net new or net new or withdrawals renewed net change withdrawals renewed dollars in thousands cds maturing in quarter ended december     march     june     september     december     the distribution of certificate accounts by date of maturity is an important indicator of the relative stability of a major source of funds 
longer term certificate accounts generally provide greater stability as a source of funds  but currently entail greater interest costs than passbook accounts

contingent or potential uses of funds the bank had million of unfunded loans at december  additionally  unused lines of credit related to credit card loans and other loans totaled million and million  respectively  at december  liquidity the regulatory required average daily balance of liquid assets is of the liquidity base  which is based on a quarterly average 
the bank s quarterly average regulatory liquidity ratio was  and at december   and  respectively 
holding company liquidity at december  and  bank plus had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
bank plus has no material potential cash producing operations or assets other than its investments in fidelity and gateway 
accordingly  bank plus is substantially dependent on dividends from fidelity and gateway in order to fund its cash needs  including its payment obligations on its million principal amount of the senior notes issued in exchange for fidelity s preferred stock 
the quarterly senior note interest payments were funded by preferred stock dividends from fidelity and cash on hand at bank plus 
the liquidity for the interest payments in is expected to be provided by preferred stock dividends from the bank and currently projected liquidity at the holding company 
the bank has an understanding with the ots which permits the payment of dividends on the bank s preferred stock so long as the bank remains at least adequately capitalized for regulatory purposes 
the understanding with the ots does not constrain the ots from restricting future dividend payments based on safety and soundness considerations or future examination findings  and no assurance can therefore be given that the ots will permit future dividend payments by fidelity to bank plus 
the bank has received no indication from the ots that it will object to the continued payment of preferred dividends 
commitments and contingencies fidelity enters into agreements to extend credit to customers on an ongoing basis 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
most commitments are expected to be drawn upon and  therefore  the total commitment amounts generally represent future cash requirements 
at december   the company had million in commitments to fund loans 
in addition  the company has extended lines of credit in the form of credit cards and other totaling million 
at december   the unused and available portion of the credit lines extended included million related to credit cards and million related to overdraft reserve lines on checking accounts and other credit lines 
as of december   the company had certain mortgage loans with a gross principal balance of million  of which million had been put into the form of mortgage pass through certificates  over various periods of time  leaving a balance of million in loans retained by the company 
these mortgage pass through certificates provide a credit enhancement to the investors in the form of the company s subordination of its retained percentage interest to that of the investors 
in this regard  the aggregate of million are deemed senior mortgage pass through certificates and the million in loans held by the company are subordinated to the senior mortgage pass through certificates in the event of borrower default 
full recovery of the million is subject to this contingent liability due to its subordination 
in  the bank repurchased a portion of the mortgage pass through certificates  and at december   the balance of the repurchased certificate was million and was included in the mbs afs portfolio and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the other senior mortgage pass through certificates totaling million at december  are owned by other investor institutions 
the contingent liability for credit losses on these mortgage pass through certificates was million and million at december  and  respectively  and is included in other liabilities 
the company also effected the securitization by fnma of multifamily mortgages wherein whole loans were swapped for triple a rated mbs through fnma s alternative credit enhancement structure aces program 
these mbs were later sold and the current outstanding balance as of december  of million is serviced by the company  including commitments assumed as a result of the hancock acquisition 
as part of a credit enhancement to absorb losses relating to the aces transaction  the company has pledged and placed in a trust account  as of december   million  comprised of million in cash and million in us agency securities 
the company shall absorb losses  if any  which may be incurred on the securitized multifamily loans to the extent of million 
fnma is responsible for any losses in excess of million 
the corresponding contingent liability for credit losses was million and million at december  and  respectively  and is included in other liabilities 
asset liability management and market risk the objective of asset liability management is to maximize the net income of the company while controlling interest rate risk exposure 
banks and savings institutions are subject to interest rate risk when assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times duration risk  against different indices basis risk or for different terms yield curve risk 
the decision to control or accept interest rate risk can only be made with an understanding of the probability of various scenarios occurring 
the following table sets out the maturity and rate sensitivity of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  gap  as reflected in the table  represents the estimated difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repricing during future periods as adjusted for interest rate swaps and other financial instruments as applicable  and based on certain assumptions  including those stated in the notes to the table 
maturity and rate sensitivity analysis as of december  maturity or repricing within over months months years years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash and cash equivalents   fhlb stock   mbs    loans receivable arms       fixed rate loans       total gross loans receivable       total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities deposits checking and savings accounts   money market accounts   fixed maturity deposits retail customers      wholesale customers total deposits      borrowings fhlb advances   other   total borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities      repricing gap      gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets repricings shown are based on the contractual maturity or repricing frequency of the instrument 
adjustable rate mortgages arms are primarily in the shorter categories as they are subject to interest rate adjustments 
these liabilities are subject to daily adjustments and are therefore included in the within months category 
the company manages interest rate risk by  among other things  maintaining a portfolio consisting primarily of arm loans 
arm loans comprised of the total mortgage loan portfolio at december  the percentage of monthly adjustable arms to total mortgage loans was at december  interest sensitive assets provide the company with a degree of long term protection from rising interest rates 
at december   approximately of fidelity s total mortgage loan portfolio consisted of loans which mature or reprice within one year 
over of the bank s arm loans are indexed to cofi and do not reprice until some time after the industry liabilities comprising cofi reprice 
in the company s case this lag is approximately four months 
historically  because the repricing of the company s liabilities were generally consistent with the repricing of cofi  the repricing of the company s loans occurred after the repricing of its liabilities 
thus  in a rising interest rate environment  the company s net interest income would be adversely affected until the majority of its interest earning assets fully repriced 
during  as a result of the bank s deposit repricing and conversion program and the reduction in the level of wholesale borrowings  the repricing of the bank s liabilities have lagged the repricing of cofi 
as a result  the bank s net yield on interest earning assets increased in during a period of increasing interest rates 
it is anticipated that the repricing of the bank s liabilities will continue to lag the repricing of cofi primarily because the bank has paid off all of its wholesale borrowings 
this may be negatively impacted by the bank s future need to utilize wholesale borrowings to fund the anticipated sale of deposits during also  because of this lag in repricing of the bank s liabilities to the repricing of cofi  the bank s net interest income may not be as positively affected by falling interest rates as other financial institutions 
analysis of the gap provides only a static view of the company s interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time 
the actual impact of interest rate movements on the company s net interest income may differ from that implied by any gap measurement 
the actual impact on net interest income may depend on the direction and magnitude of the interest rate movement  as well as competitive and market pressures 
the company may employ interest rate swaps  caps and floors in the management of interest rate risk 
an interest rate swap agreement is a financial transaction where two counterparties agree to exchange different streams of payments over time 
an interest rate swap involves no exchange of principal either at inception or upon maturity  rather  it involves the periodic exchange of interest payments arising from an underlying notional principal amount 
interest rate caps and floors generally involve the payment of a one time premium to a counterparty who  if interest rates rise or fall  above or below a predetermined level  will make payments to the company at an agreed upon rate for the term of the agreement until such time as interest rates fall below or rise above the cap or floor level 
by their nature all such instruments involve risk  and the maximum potential loss may exceed the value at which such instruments are carried 
as is customary for these types of instruments  the company usually does not require collateral or other security from other parties to these instruments 
the company manages its credit exposure to counterparties through credit approvals  credit limits and other monitoring procedures 
the company s credit policy committee makes recommendations regarding counterparties and credit limits which are subject to approval by the board of directors 
there were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  or market risk the bank s asset liability committee alco  which includes senior management representatives  monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income 
a primary purpose of the company s asset liability management is to manage interest rate risk to effectively invest the company s capital and to preserve the value created by its core business operations 
as such  certain management monitoring processes are designed to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on npv and net interest income 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by the board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the company s change in npv in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates and interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of the bank s assets and liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is used to measure the company s interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in npv of its cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
npv is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained one hundred to three hundred basis points increase or decrease in the market interest rates 
npv is calculated by the company pursuant to the guidelines established by the ots 
the calculation is based on the net present value of estimated discounted cash flows utilizing market prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker quotations and other public sources as of december   with adjustments made to reflect the shift in the treasury yield curve as appropriate 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposits decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the company s projected change in npv for the various rate shock levels at the dates indicated december  december  percentage change in percentage change in change in interest rates net interest net portfolio net interest net portfolio in basis points income value income value base case the percentage change in this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change in this column represents the npv of the bank in a stable interest rate environment versus the npv in the various rate scenarios 
the following table shows the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to change in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december  this data differs from that in the gap table as it does not incorporate the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
rather  it only reflects contractual maturities adjusted for anticipated prepayments

the estimated fair values were computed as follows a investment and mbs securities were based on quoted market prices  and b loans  mortgage servicing rights and all interest sensitive liabilities were based on an option adjusted cash flow valuation oacfv  which includes forward interest rate simulations 
there exists a high level of uncertainty related to the future performance of the credit card portfolio because of the high levels of delinquencies and charge offs 
as a result  the fair values included above may not be indicative of the value derived upon a sale of all or part of the credit card portfolios 
year the company utilizes computer software programs  systems and devices with embedded microchips systems throughout the organization in order to support its on going operations 
corrective action was required for these systems to correctly interpret and process dates into the company implemented and completed a plan of corrective action including upgrading and testing all systems for year compliance 
as of the issuing of this report no significant issues have resulted related to the systems ability to correctly interpret and process dates in the principle tasks remaining are to perform tests of quarter end processing and monitoring ongoing operations for problems that may occur in the months ahead 
the total expense for year project activities was million 
a significant portion of this cost was for staffing of technology and support personnel to implement the required modifications and upgrades 
additional personnel were also required to perform the system testing  produce testing documentation  and prepare contingency plans required by the federal financial insurance examinations council the ffiec 
the company had incurred year related expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferred at the effective date of fasb statement no 
 effective for financial statements for periods beginning after june  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires the company to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement allows derivatives to be designated as hedges only if certain criteria are met  with the resulting gain or loss on the derivative either charged to income or reported as a part of other comprehensive income 
at this time  the company has not determined whether the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its operations and financial position 
on march   the fasb issued an exposure draft  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  which is expected to result in a fasb interpretation of certain practice issues related to the application of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the fasb plans to issue a final interpretation in the first quarter of among other things the exposure draft addressed the accounting for changes to the exercise price or the number of shares to be issued under a stock option grant that originally qualified as a fixed award 
the fasb concluded if the terms of a stock option  which was originally accounted for as a fixed award  are modified during the option term to change the exercise price or the number of shares to be issued  that option shall be accounted for as a variable award  thereby  requiring the measurement of compensation cost from the date of modification to the date of exercise 
with the exceptions identified below  the final interpretation is expected to be effective on and after july   and the effects of applying the interpretation shall be recognized on a prospective basis 
with respect to the guidance regarding direct and indirect repricings and new grants or awards for purposes of determining whether the grantee meets the definition of an employee under opinion no 
the effective date will be december   however the effects of application can only be recognized after june  because the company has in the past modified the exercise price on certain options there maybe a negative effect on future operations depending on the future movement of the company s stock price
