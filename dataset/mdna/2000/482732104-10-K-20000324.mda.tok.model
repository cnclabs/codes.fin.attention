consequently  k recorded charges to cost of products sold for restructuring costs of million  or million and 
per diluted share after tax  and downsizing costs of million  or million and 
per diluted share after tax 
these costs are associated with the downsizing of production and reduction of personnel  as well as the write off of related equipment and inventory 
in  k adopted a plan to dispose of its simplex building products division 
this plan is consistent with k s strategy to focus on its core sporting goods and other recreational products businesses 
as a result  k reclassified simplex as a discontinued operation in and similarly reclassified prior years operations 
k currently continues to pursue its plan to dispose of simplex and  accordingly  has reported the operation as discontinued in the current year 
the discussion which follows focuses on the continuing operations of k review of operations comparison of to net sales from continuing operations increased to million from million in the prior year

net sales 
in the sporting goods segment  net sales increased to million from million in the increase was attributable to strong demand during the year for most of the products in the segment 
in line skates  snowboard products  fishing tackle and bikes all registered double digit growth 
the increase in shipments of in line skates reflected the strong demand for k s softboot skates  especially in the european market  and worldwide growth of the children s softboot skate line 
improved snowboard volume reflected the benefit of the ride and morrow acquisitions completed during the year and expansion of distribution into the japanese market 
shakespeare fishing tackle continued to show strength in sales led by the popular ugly stik fishing rod series  packaged rods and reels and new product introductions 
bikes benefited from its repositioned bike product line

partially offsetting this decline was improved sales of specialty resins and marine antennas 
gross profit

in the fourth quarter of  k announced a strategic initiative to significantly reduce the cost structure of its ski and snowboard operations by restructuring and downsizing the seattle manufacturing operation to take advantage of lower cost manufacturing and sourcing opportunities in asia  europe and the united states 
this resulted in a charge to cost of products sold for restructuring costs of million and related downsizing costs of million 
in  a charge was recorded to write down the cost of high end  full suspension mountain bike and aggressive skate inventory resulting from the sudden shift in market demand and subsequent repositioning of the bike business into more popularly priced  front suspension mountain bikes  comfort bikes and bmx bikes 
excluding the impact of the charge in both years  gross profit as a percentage of sales was comparable at costs and expenses

net sales 
in the sporting goods segment  net sales decreased to million from million in the decrease was primarily due to a decline in ski and mountain bike sales 
unfavorable weather conditions in the important fourth quarter combined with the impact of declining industry sales worldwide resulted in lower shipments of k and olin brand skis 
sales of the bike business were down substantially due to a rapid shift in the marketplace away from high end  full suspension mountain bikes 
since k bikes were positioned in the high end niche  full suspension mountain bike shipments declined for the year 
more modest declines were incurred in sales of outdoor products 
k softboot in line skate sales were comparable with the prior year 
a decline in sales of aggressive skates  due to an industry wide reduction in demand  was offset by the growth of k children s skates 
sales increases were reported in k snowboard products  shakespeare fishing tackle and stearns products

new product introductions including inflatables  waders and other products by stearns also contributed to the increase in sales 
in the other recreational products segment  net sales grew to million from million in the prior year

the remaining reduction in the gross profit percentage was due mainly to an unfavorable sales mix which included a larger proportion of closeout bikes  skates and skis at reduced or no margins

research and development expense increased to million from million in operating income 
operating income from continuing operations declined to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in the percentage decrease is mainly due to the charge discussed above which totaled million  and due to an unfavorable mix of sales which included a greater proportion of skis  aggressive skates and mountain bikes sold at discounted prices

segment information 
total segment operating profit or loss before interest  corporate expenses and income taxes decreased to million from million in in the sporting goods segment operating profit declined to million from million in the decrease was due to a wider loss in the full suspension mountain bike business reflecting a decline in sales due to a shift in the market and resulting sale of inventory at reduced prices  resulting in a million charge  and sales of other sporting goods products at reduced margins such as skis and in line skates as described above 
in the other recreational products segment  an operating loss of million was reported in as compared with operating profit of 
million in the current year loss was due to start up costs of new products for the emerging sports market  partially offset by improved operating profits of the activewear group 
in the industrial products segment  operating profit increased million from million in the improvement was attributable to sales related gains in the monofilament and specialty resins businesses 
liquidity and sources of capital k s continuing operations provided million of cash as contrasted with million of cash used in the million year to year improvement in cash  excluding the effects of acquisitions  is primarily attributable to the reduction in inventories as compared with the prior year s increase  and an increase in accounts payable as compared with the prior year s decrease 
the reduction in inventory levels  is attributable to a program initiated by all segments to reduce inventory levels by working with the supply chain to reduce purchasing lead times and receiving product when needed 
the increase in accounts payable is attributable to more favorable payment terms obtained from vendors throughout k net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was million  as compared to million in the improvement was attributable to a reduction in net capital expenditures in the current year 
no material commitments for capital expenditures existed at year end 
cash used in financing activities was million as contrasted with cash provided of million in cash provided in from operations was used to pay down short and long term debt and debt assumed from acquisitions  resulting in a reduction of total debt of million as compared to the prior year 
k s principal long term borrowing facility is a million credit line credit line which becomes due on september  additionally  k has a million accounts receivable purchase facility purchase facility 
at december   million was outstanding under the credit line and million of accounts receivable had been sold under the purchase facility 
under the credit line and purchase facility  k is subject to an agreement which  among other things  restricts amounts available for payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases by k as of december   million of retained earnings were free of such restrictions 
k also had million of unsecured senior notes due through  payable in six equal principal payments  and million of unsecured notes due through  payable in seven equal principal payments commencing in the notes are subject to agreements which are generally less restrictive than the long term borrowing facilities 
additionally  at december   k had million under foreign and domestic short term lines of credit with million outstanding and no borrowings available under k s debt covenant restrictions 
for further information regarding k s borrowings  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
k anticipates its cash needs in will be provided from operations and from borrowings  principally under its credit line and purchase facility and  to a lesser extent  other existing credit lines 
environmental matters k is one of several named potentially responsible parties prp in an environmental protection agency matter involving discharge of hazardous materials at old waste sites in south carolina and michigan 
although environmental laws technically impose joint and several liability upon each prp at each site  the extent of k s required financial contribution to the cleanup of these sites is expected to be limited based on the number and financial strength of the other named prps and the volume and types of waste involved which might be attributable to k environmental and related remediation costs are difficult to quantify for a number of reasons including the number of parties involved  the difficulty in determining the extent of the contamination  the length of time remediation may require  the complexity of environmental regulation and the continuing advancement of remediation technology 
k s environmental engineers  consultants and legal counsel have developed estimates based upon cost analyses and other available information for this particular site 
k accrues for these costs when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
at december  and  k had recorded an estimated liability of approximately  and  respectively  with no provision for expected insurance recovery 
the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty  however  and taking into consideration reserves provided  management does not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on k s financial statements 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires companies to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
k will adopt sfas no 
in the adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position 
impact of inflation and changing prices the inflation rate  as measured by the consumer price index  has been relatively low in the last few years  and therefore  pricing decisions by k have largely been influenced by competitive market conditions 
depreciation expense is based on the historical cost to k of its fixed assets  and therefore  is considerably less than it would be if it were based on current replacement cost 
while buildings  machinery and equipment acquired in prior years will ultimately have to be replaced at significantly higher prices  it is expected that this will be a gradual process over many years 
year issue in prior years  k discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  k completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  k experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
k is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
k incurred approximately 
million expensed and 
million capitalized million during in connection with remediating its systems 
k will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
statement regarding forward looking disclosure this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which represent k s expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including  but not limited to  the following statements regarding market trends regarding softboot in line skates  bikes  skis and snowboards  inventory levels at retail  product acceptance and demand  marketing efforts  growth efforts  cost reduction efforts  margin enhancement efforts  product development efforts  success of new product introductions  marketing positioning and overall market trends which involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those indicated in forward looking statements by reason of a number of factors  many of which are outside of k s control 
among such factors are the following developments in the economies of the united states  europe and asia 
a substantial portion of k sales are to customers in europe and asia  and a significant portion of k products are manufactured in china 
adverse economic changes in the united states or such foreign markets could result in decreased sales and revenues  inflationary pressures on costs of production  and or increases in interest and other costs 
changes in currency exchange rates 
changes in the exchange rates between the united states dollar and the currencies of europe and asia could make k products less competitive in foreign markets  and could reduce the value of revenues represented by foreign currencies 
unexpected delays and costs of restructuring 
k has undertaken a significant restructuring of its manufacturing operations for skis and snowboards  including a shift in some manufacturing to china 
failure to complete the restructuring timely and efficiently could eliminate anticipated cost savings  or even lead to increased costs of production 
unfavorable political developments 
k s business is dependent on international trade  both for sales of finished goods and low cost sourcing of products 
any political developments adversely affecting trade with europe or asia  including china  could severely impact k results of operations 
competitive developments and initiatives by k s competitors 
new product introductions  financial incentives to retailers and other initiatives by k competitors could weaken the market position of k products 
rapid changes in marketing strategies  product design  styles and tastes 
consumer demand for recreational products is strongly influenced by matters of taste and style 
further  development of the internet is leading to dramatic changes in product marketing and distribution 
k s success is dependent  in significant part  on its ability to keep abreast of  and lead  such changes 
weather 
sales of k s recreational products are strongly influenced by the weather 
poor snow conditions in the winter or summer conditions unfavorable to water sports can adversely affect sales of important k products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk k s earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
k manages its exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain firm purchase commitments and anticipated  but not yet committed purchases  by entering into foreign currency forward contracts 
k s risk management objective is to reduce its exposure to the effects of changes in exchange rates on the cost of products sold over quarterly time horizons 
foreign currency exchange rate movements also affect k s competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors and may affect the profitability and pricing strategies of k as well 
k s foreign currency risk policies entail entering into foreign currency derivative instruments only to manage risk of currency fluctuations over a given period of time  not for speculative investments 
considering both the anticipated cash flows from firm purchase commitments and anticipated purchases for the next quarter and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year end  a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not materially adversely affect expected first quarter earnings or cash flows 
this analysis is dependent on actual purchases during the next quarter occurring within of budgeted forecasts 
the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
in addition  it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen
