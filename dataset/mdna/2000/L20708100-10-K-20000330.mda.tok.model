item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial and statistical information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
general the company generates revenues by leasing to ocean carriers marine containers that are owned either by managed container owners or by the company itself 
these leases  which generate most of the company s revenues  are generally operating leases 
the segment information presented in note to the company s consolidated financial statements relates to the portions of the company s fleet owned by the company itself owned containers  or by the company s managed container programs managed container owners which are comprised of us limited partnerships and other container owners other container owners 
owned containers include containers held for resale  the financing costs of which are borne by the company prior to the sale of such containers to managed container owners  and are accounted for in the owned container segment 
the company bears the risk of ownership with respect to containers in owned containers but not with respect to the majority of containers in the managed container owners segments  although the company bears the risk that the management agreements could be terminated  resulting in the removal of the corresponding managed containers from the fleet 
at december   approximately  and of the company s fleet by original equipment cost was owned by us limited partnerships  other container owners and owned containers  respectively 
all containers  whether owned or managed  are operated as part of a single fleet 
the company has discretion over which ocean carriers  container manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services it deals with 
since the company s management agreements with the managed container owners meet the definition of leases in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 they are accounted for in the company s financial statements as leases under which the container owners are lessors and the company is lessee 
the agreements with container owners generally provide that the company will make payments to the container owners based upon the rentals collected from ocean carriers after deducting direct operating expenses and a management fee 
the majority of payments to container owners are therefore contingent upon the leasing of the containers by the company to ocean carriers and the collection of lease rentals 
minimum lease payments on the agreements which have fixed payment terms are presented in note c to the company s consolidated financial statements 
over of payments to container owners represent a percentage of the rentals collected from the ocean carriers to whom containers are leased by the company 
gross lease revenue represents revenue from operating leases  excluding billings in advance 
these amounts are billed in us dollars on a monthly basis 
amounts due under master leases are calculated by the company at the end of each month and billed approximately to days thereafter 
amounts due under short term and long term leases are set forth in the respective lease agreements and are generally payable monthly 
changes in gross lease revenue depend primarily upon fleet growth  utilization rates and per diem rates 
the company has expanded its fleet since december  from  teu to  teu at december  during and  the ability of the company to purchase new equipment for both the owned and managed fleets was constrained by the levels of financing available to the company 
the following chart summarizes the combined utilization of the cronos fleet based on approximate original equipment cost at the dates indicated december  utilization the short term objective of the company is to improve utilization by offering greater leasing incentives and actively repositioning equipment to higher demand locations 
the company continues to take advantage of its marketing resources in order to seek out leasing opportunities 
while this short term strategy will increase repositioning expenses  it may also reduce those expenses related to storing off hire containers 
these measures will also provide the longer term advantage of placing the containers where the demand is greatest 
during the course of  economic reforms in asia  as well as in latin america  have begun to produce gradual improvement in terms of world trade  and there are preliminary indications that containerized trade volumes from north america and europe to asia  in particular  may be increasing 
intra asian trade  which also had stagnated since the asian financial crisis began nearly two years ago  has shown increased activity in recent months 
these favorable signs  however  have yet to produce any significant positive impact on the company s operating performance 
in  utilization declined reflecting the deteriorating economic position in asian  south american and other markets 
utilization experienced steady growth during due to marketing efforts and improved inventory management 
the company s average per diem rates have fallen consistently throughout  and this reflects the rationalization in the global shipping industry and competitive market conditions 
during the course of  the company s combined per diem rate fell by approximately from the combined rate at december commissions  fees and other operating income includes acquisition fees relating to the company s managed container programs  income from direct financing leases principally containers leased under lease purchase arrangements  fees earned in connection with the manufacture and sale of dry freight special and other products  fees from the disposal of used containers  syndication fees relating to the company s limited partnership offerings and miscellaneous other fees and income 
this item is affected by the size of new managed programs  the purchase price of containers acquired for new managed programs  the quantity of dry freight special and other products manufactured and sold  the number and value of direct financing leases and income from disposals of used containers 
although acquisition fees are generally received in cash at the inception of a managed container program and are non refundable  they are amortized in the statement of operations on a straight line basis over the period of the managed container agreement to which they relate 
direct operating expenses are direct costs associated with leasing containers  both owned and managed 
these expenses include depot costs such as repairs  maintenance  handling and storage  non depot expenses such as insurance  agent fees and repositioning costs  and other expenses such as provisions for doubtful accounts and legal costs 
direct operating expenses are affected primarily by fleet size and utilization 
the majority of direct operating expenses relate to off hire containers  and therefore these costs are sensitive to the quantity of off hire containers as well as the frequency at which containers are re delivered 
payments to container owners reflect the amounts due to managed container owners  computed in accordance with the terms of the individual agreements 
selling  general and administrative expenses include all employee and office costs  professional fees and computer systems costs 
operating profit or loss  for reported segments  includes items directly attributable to specific containers in each of the company s operating segments  as well as items not attributable to any specific container but instead are allocated across operating segments 
items directly attributable to operating segments include gross lease revenue  direct operating expenses  payments to container owners  container interest and depreciation expense 
indirect items allocated across segments include selling  general and administrative expenses and interest  depreciation and impairment charges on the company s non container assets

new accounting pronouncements in june   the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and how it is designated 
a variable cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction is initially recorded as comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
gains and losses from foreign currency exposure hedges are reported in other comprehensive income as part of the cumulative translation adjustment 
gains and losses from fair value hedges are recognized in earnings in the period of any changes in the fair value of the related recognized asset or liability or firm commitment 
gains and losses on derivative instruments that are not designated as a hedging instrument are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
sfas  as amended by sfas  is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   and should not be applied retroactively to financial statements for prior periods 
the company is assessing the impact that sfas will have in accounting for its derivative transactions and hedging activities 
in december  the staff of the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this item should be read in conjunction with and by reference to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table sets forth principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for debt and capital lease obligations at december  expected maturity date of debt and capital lease obligations us dollar equivalent  in thousands long term debt and capital lease obligations fixed rate us      average interest rate fixed rate gbp  average interest rate variable rate us       average interest rate interest rate risk outstanding borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
at december   of total borrowings had floating interest rates 
the company performed an analysis of borrowings with variable interest rates to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this analysis  the same change was applied to the current balance outstanding leaving all other factors constant 
it was found that if a increase was applied to market rates  the expected effect would be to reduce annual cash flows by million 
exchange rate risk substantially all of the company s revenues are billed and paid in us dollars and approximately of costs in were incurred and paid in us dollars 
of the remaining costs  approximately are individually small  unpredictable and incurred in various denominations and thus are not suitable for cost effective hedging 
from time to time  cronos hedges a portion of the expenses that are predictable and are principally in uk pounds sterling 
in addition  almost all of the company s container purchases are paid for in us dollars 
as exchange rates are outside of the control of the company  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
by reference to  it is estimated that for every fall in value of the us dollar  the effect would be to reduce cash flows by million in any similar year
