if such refinancing occurs  the write off of certain deferred financing costs associated with the september debt restructuring will be accelerated and certain prepayment premiums on outstanding note obligations will become due 
the amounts of such prepayment premiums depend on the treasury rates in effect at the time of such payment 
the company has established reserves for what it estimates to be a substantial portion of such prepayment premium

in recent years  the company s income taxes and effective consolidated income tax rate have been materially affected by changes in the proportion of domestic and foreign earnings 
while earnings from operations in north america and western europe are primarily taxed at or above united states income tax rates  earnings from the company s asian operations are taxed at a current maximum rate of 
however  the actual tax rate from asian operations is dependent upon the proportion of earnings from mainland china  which have been subject to a tax holiday 
recoton s chinese subsidiary  being a production oriented foreign investment enterprise located in a special economic zone in china  was granted a five year tax holiday beginning in this tax holiday allows for full exemption from chinese corporate tax for the and years  and a exemption for the following three years 
through december   the company had not provided for additional us income taxes which would be payable upon the payment of dividends from its hong kong subsidiaries because the earnings of these subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested 
however  as a result of business requirements of the company s domestic operations caused in part from the provisions of the debt restructuring agreement  in the company repatriated a portion of such earnings  which resulted in additional income tax expense 
additionally  in  in accordance with the terms of the settlement reached with the us customs service  million of the settlement was tax deductible and the resulting income tax benefit has been included with the income tax provision 
the combination of the foregoing factors resulted in an income tax expense of million or of pretax loss in the company s effective income tax rate on future earnings from asia and additional us income taxes on the unremitted asian retained earnings at december  are  in part  dependent upon its future domestic cash requirements and domestic tax situation in the periods any intercompany dividends are declared 
the company currently estimates that the balance of its asian retained earnings will remain indefinitely invested 
such estimate is subject to future revision based upon such factors as the results of domestic operations  ability to borrow or otherwise obtain funds to finance operations  market conditions in the consumer electronics industry and general economic conditions in the united states and in asia 
in  the company reported an income tax expense of million on pretax income of million  which income was comprised of a combination of foreign earnings and domestic losses 
in addition  since no determination had been made at december  as to what portion of the expected settlement with the us customs service might be deductible for income tax purposes  no deduction had been made for this item in the computation of income taxes for comprehensive income is comprised of the net income or loss and foreign currency translation adjustments which adjustments  net of income tax effect  were a negative million in and a positive million in included in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity

selling  general and administrative expenses increased in by million to million  and decreased as a percentage of net sales from in to in the dollar increase was attributable to the variable selling expenses related to the increased sales volume 
there were also additional expenses for promotional activities and market development

foreign operations 
to date there has been limited exposure to loss due to foreign currency risks in the company s asian subsidiaries  because the hong kong dollar has been pegged to the us dollar at an official exchange rate of hk to us 
additionally  in recent years there have been no material fluctuations in the hong kong chinese exchange rates 
also  the company maintains the majority of its currency in asia in us dollar accounts 
however  there can be no assurance that these relationships will continue 
the company s operations  which are currently being transacted on a global basis  are exposed to variations in foreign exchange rates 
shareholders equity was decreased by a foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately million in during  the shareholders equity was increased by a foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately million 
the changes in the exchange rates of the german and italian currencies against the american dollar  which were the principle causes of the foreign translation adjustments  had no material impact on results of operations but such adjustments serve to reduce the company s tangible net worth which is required to be maintained at specified levels under financial covenants in loan and note purchase agreements 
if there are any material adverse changes in the relationships between the european and or canadian currencies with the united states dollar or if the hong kong or chinese currencies should no longer be tied to the us dollar  such changes could adversely affect the results of the company s european  canadian and or asian operations included in the consolidated financial statements and could cause further increases in the amount of foreign currency translation adjustments which are charged directly to shareholders equity 
the company has leased expanded facilities for sales and warehousing in germany and the uk in addition  the company is considering the purchase of additional computer hardware and software including upgrades to the company s management information system to be used both in the united states and in its foreign locations 
the company does not  however  anticipate engaging in any other acquisitions 
year the company did not experience  and does not anticipate experiencing  any problems in connection with what is known as the year or yk issue  either in its own operations or as a result of operations of its significant customers and vendors 
the cost of achieving yk compliance did not have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
implications to the company from the adoption of a european common currency recoton has extensive operations in certain european countries  including germany  italy and the united kingdom 
the company also sells to additional countries in europe 
in  approximately of the company s net sales were in europe 
with the exception of the united kingdom  all of the european countries in which the company has operations have confirmed their participation in a new country european common currency  the euro 
the adoption of such common currency is being phased in over a three year period  which started in january during such phase in period  both the euro and the historical currency of a country will be valid  although new euro denominated currency will not be issued until each member country will decide when its legacy currency will cease to be legal tender  which will occur during the period january through june  until the introduction of euro denominated currency  the paying party will have the option to decide whether to pay in the legacy currency or in euro converted to the legacy currency 
among other possible economic implications  it is expected that the adoption of such common currency will lead to greater price transparency and thereby increased competition within such common currency zone 
for instance  with a single currency applicable to the entire region  consumers may be able to more easily discern any material price differences for the company s products between different countries and modify their buying practices accordingly 
this may require adjustments in the company s marketing and pricing strategies 
whether any such price differentials will lead to significant changes in purchasing practices by the company s customers depends on factors such as convenience and language related matters as well as other factors which may determine where a consumer will purchase products 
the company is not able at this time to gauge whether the likelihood of increased competition arising from the introduction of the euro would have any significant long term adverse impact on the pricing for the company s products 
the adoption of a common currency may require a significant modification to the company s accounting systems 
among other things  it will be necessary to operate in each country with dual currencies until the three year phase in period has passed 
management believes  however  that any necessary changes can be rapidly and inexpensively implemented using off the shelf systems if the company s internal systems are not sufficient 
other risks associated with such currency conversion include possible currency exchange and tax risks  neither of which the company believes will have a significant affect 
the company does not believe that the adoption of a common currency will give any parties to material contracts with the company the right to terminate or modify such contracts on the grounds of frustration  impossibility or impracticability 
the company has not experienced  and does not anticipate  that there will be any material adverse impact on the company or its european business resulting from the adoption of the euro and any resulting changes in european economic and market conditions

 accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no

in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
for the company until the company has not yet determined whether the application of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk approximately of the company s borrowings bear fixed interest rates 
the borrowings under the revolving credit portion of the credit facilities bear various rates depending on changes in the prime rate 
the company has no significant foreign borrowings from third parties 
recoton corporation and certain of its subsidiaries have intercompany loans which are not denominated in their home country currency  which exposes the company to exchange rate fluctuations 
the company has not entered into any foreign currency or derivative contracts to hedge these potential exchange adjustments  which are initially recorded as cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments a component of shareholders equity  but will ultimately be reflected in operations when the debt is repaid 
exclusive of intercompany receivables and payables for current transactions  the outstanding foreign currency loans at december  expressed in us dollars at current exchange rates which remain subject to currency fluctuations consist of million in loans made by recoton corporation and its subsidiaries to other subsidiaries in germany and italy 
these loans have no fixed due dates
