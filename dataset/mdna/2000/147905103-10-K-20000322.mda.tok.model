the increase in sales returns allowances allowed the company to better manage the level of inventory in the distribution channel 
international sales were million  million  and million in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of net sales 
lower international sales were the result of a reduction in general demand for the company s print server products in asia and increased local competition in europe 
most of the company s international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
such sales could be adversely affected by changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
cost of sales cost of sales includes cost of materials  including components  manuals  diskettes  packaging materials  assembly and shipping  as well as certain royalties 
cost of sales also includes compensation costs and overhead related to the company s manufacturing operations  obsolescence and manufacturing costs and warranty expenses 
cost of sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and represented  and of net sales for those years 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales has remained constant during these years as a result of a higher proportion of net sales being derived from higher margin fax products  offset by a lower gross margin percentage on sales of print servers and unfavorable manufacturing overhead absorption rates due to lower volumes

working capital decreased primarily because of the operating loss in the company has a million secured revolving line of credit with a bank  which expires in march  pursuant to which the company may borrow against pledges of cash at the bank s prime rate at december  
borrowings under this line of credit agreement are collateralized by all of the assets of the company 
under the terms of the loan agreement  the company is restricted from loaning money or assets or entering into any mergers or acquisitions where the total consideration exceeds  without the bank s consent 
the company was in compliance with the terms of the agreement  and at december  had no borrowings under the line of credit 
the company expects to negotiate an extension of this line of credit

although the company believes that its existing capital resources and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its anticipated capital requirements at least through the next months  the company may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for the company s existing and new products and changes in technology in the networking industry 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when needed  if at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company considered the provision of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  however  the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
while much of the company s revenue is transacted in u 
s dollars  some revenues and capital spending are transacted in pounds sterling 
these amounts are not currently material to the financial statements of castelle  therefore we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not materially affect the company s overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the fair value of the company s money market account or related income would not be significantly impacted by increases or decreases in interest rates due mainly to the highly liquid nature of this investment 
however  sharp declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings on this account
