liquidity and capital resources the company has satisfied its cash requirements principally from internally generated cash flow and borrowings 
the company s need for funds is derived primarily from capital expenditures  working capital  share repurchase and strategic investments 
during the twelve months ended april   the company increased its cash balances by million from operating  investing and financing activities before the effect of exchange rates 
this million is million below the million generated before the effect of exchange rates by the company s operating  investing and financing activities during the twelve months ended april  the million decrease was a result of million more cash provided by the company s operating activities offset by million more cash utilized by the company s investing and financing activities 
operating activities the company generated million in cash from operating activities of continuing operations in fiscal as compared to million generated during the million increase year over year in cash generated from the operating activities was a result of a million increase in net income adjusted for depreciation  amortization and other non cash items  a million decrease in accounts receivable  a million reduction in the current investment in sales type leases and a million decrease in other assets 
these sources of cash were offset by increased uses of cash from a million increased inventory investment  a million increase in prepaid taxes  million of fiscal year refunds that did not recur in fiscal year  and a million decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities due to lower tax provision accruals in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the company measures its performance using an operating cash flow metric defined as net income adjusted for depreciation  amortization and other non cash items  capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment together with the investment in haemonetics equipment at customer sites  including sales type leases  and the change in operating working capital  including change in accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and accrued expenses  excluding tax accounts and the effects of currency translation

the million of operating cash generated for fiscal year resulted from million of net income adjusted for non cash items  million from the reduction of the company s net investment in property plant and equipment and sales type leases and million in lower working capital investment 
investing activities the company utilized million in cash for investing activities from continuing operations in  an increase of million from the million increase in cash utilized is attributable to a fiscal year investment in transfusion technology corporation of million  and a million decrease in the cash generated from the net repayment of long term sales type leases as compared to fiscal year financing activities during the twelve months ended april   the company purchased  shares of its outstanding common stock at an average market price of which utilized million in cash

this reflects a decrease of million in working capital for the twelve months ended april   largely due to a shift to short term notes from long term borrowings  and million accrued in accounts payable at april  for an unsettled stock repurchase transaction 
the company believes its sources of cash are adequate to meet its projected needs 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which the company will be required to adopt in the first quarter of fiscal year sab provides additional guidance on the accounting for revenue recognition including both broad conceptual discussions  as well as certain industry specific guidance 
the company is in the process of accumulating the information necessary to quantify the potential impact  if any  of this new guidance 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  or in the case of a hedge of a forecasted probable transaction  a derivative s gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income until the transaction is consummated 
additionally  a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  a company may implement sfas no 
as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance that is fiscal quarters beginning june  and thereafter 
sfas no 
cannot be applied retroactively 
the impacts of adopting sfas no 
on the company s financial statements or the timing of adoption of sfas no

cautionary statement regarding forward looking information statements contained in this report  as well as oral statements made by the company that are prefaced with the words may  will  expect  anticipate  continue  estimate  project  intend  designed and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements regarding events  conditions and financial trends that may affect the company s future plans of operations  business strategy  results of operations and financial position 
these statements are based on the company s current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances about which the company can give no firm assurance 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made 
as it is not possible to predict every new factor that may emerge  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future financial condition or results 
these forward looking statements  like any forward looking statements  involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or unanticipated 
such risks and uncertainties include technological advances in the medical field and the company s ability to successfully implement products that incorporate such advances  product demand and market acceptance of the company s products  regulatory uncertainties  the effect of economic conditions  the impact of competitive products and pricing  foreign currency exchange rates  changes in customers ordering patterns  the effect of uncertainties in markets outside the us including europe and asia in which the company operates  and the implications of year including but not limited to the cost and expense of any potential system interruptions 
the foregoing list should not be construed as exhaustive 
year costs haemonetics made the transition to the calendar year without any significant year interruptions 
throughout the course of the year project  the company spent approximately million replacing or upgrading over pcs and other computers  telecommunication systems around the world and adding back up capabilities 
in addition  a complete inventory of computer software was developed 
over of the software applications were upgraded  remediated  or retired 
several non information technology functions were also improved including manufacturing facilities and customer support areas 
the company also took this opportunity to leverage year contingency planning activities into disaster recovery plans for locations around the world 
risks the company continues to evaluate the risks associated with the potential delayed impact of year related failures 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third parties  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s year project has significantly reduced the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of its critical vendors 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the company s year project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations has been reduced 
euro currency effective january   of the countries in the european union austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  holland  ireland  italy  luxembourg  portugal and spain adopted a single currency known as the euro 
for the three years following january   these countries will be allowed to transact business in both the euro and in their own currencies at fixed exchange rates 
beginning on july   the euro will become the only currency for these countries 
operations in europe the introduction of the euro may have a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company has subsidiaries located throughout europe  that generate one third of its sales 
state of readiness the company has formed a euro steering committee the committee to address all issues related to the euro 
this committee is now preparing a detailed action plan which will cover all areas of concern including information systems  finance  tax  treasury  legal  marketing and human resources 
as a part of the detailed action plan  a comprehensive questionnaire was distributed to all of the company s european subsidiaries to gain a better understanding of the impact of the euro currency in each location 
currently  the responses to the questionnaires are being analyzed and specific action plans are being developed for each subsidiary 
date of conversion the target date for conversion of the company s local and corporate information systems to the euro is april   which is the first day of the company s fiscal year business activities although the introduction of the euro will likely result in greater transparency of pricing throughout europe  it is anticipated that these changes will have little impact on haemonetics 
the company s products are heavily regulated by organizations specific to each country and as a result  transactions between countries are infrequent 
information systems the company is continuing to gain a more complete view of the impact of the euro conversion on its information systems 
the company realizes it will create technical challenges to adapt information technology and other systems to accommodate euro denominated transactions 
the committee is in the process of identifying all systems and determining their state of euro readiness 
the cost of adapting these systems is not yet known  but the company does not believe it to be significant 
all systems will be tested during the first two quarters of fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposures relative to market risk are due to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk 
foreign exchange risk over two thirds of the company s revenues are generated outside the us yet the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
foreign exchange risk arises because the company engages in business in foreign countries in local currency 
exposure is partially mitigated by producing and sourcing product in local currency 
accordingly  whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the other major currencies  there is an adverse affect on the company s results of operations and alternatively  whenever the us dollar weakens relative to the other major currencies  there is a positive effect on the company s results of operations 
it is the company s policy to minimize for a period of time the unforeseen impact on its results of operations of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments known as forward contracts to hedge the majority of its firm sales commitments to customers that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the company also enters into forward contracts that settle within days to hedge certain intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
actual gains and losses on all forward contracts are recorded in operations  offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying transactions being hedged 
these derivative financial instruments are not used for trading purposes 
the company s primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the us dollar are the japanese yen and the euro equivalent of the french franc  deutsche mark and italian lire 
at april   the company had the following foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm sales commitments denominated in foreign currency outstanding hedged buy sell weighted forward us unrealized currency local currency contract rate current fwd gain loss maturity euro equivalent    apr jun euro equivalent    jul sep euro equivalent    oct dec euro equivalent    jan mar japanese yen  per us   apr jun japanese yen  per us   jul sep japanese yen  per us   oct dec japanese yen  per us   jan mar total   the company estimated the change in the fair value of all forward contracts assuming both a strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to all other major currencies 
in the event of a strengthening of the us dollar  the change in fair value of all forward contracts would create an additional million unrealized gain  whereas a weakening of the us dollar would create an additional million unrealized loss 
interest rate risk all of the company s long term debt is at fixed rates 
accordingly  a change in interest rates has an insignificant effect on the company s interest expense amounts 
the fair value of the company s long term debt however would change in response to interest rates movements due to its fixed rate nature 
at april   the fair value of the company s long term debt was approximately million higher than the value of the debt reflected on the company s financial statements 
this higher fair market is primarily related to the million  fixed rate senior notes the company holds 
these notes represent approximately of the company s outstanding long term borrowings at april  at april   the fair value of the company s long term debt was million higher than the value of the debt reflected on the company s financial statements 
using scenario analysis  the company changed the interest rate on all long term maturities by from the rate levels  which existed at april  the effect was a change in the fair value of the company s long term debt  of approximately million
