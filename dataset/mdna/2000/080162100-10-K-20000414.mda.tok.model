the resignation of the bank s chief operating officer and senior lending officer in march followed by the closure in april and subsequent bankruptcy of schwartz homes  inc  the bank s largest commercial borrower  marked the beginning of a tumultuous year 
in june  belmont s chief executive officer resigned  and the board of directors engaged an interim management group to provide executive management services and to assist in the recruitment of a new chief executive officer 
throughout  the bank s staff worked diligently to assess the magnitude of the losses associated with schwartz homes  inc and related consumer loans and to evaluate the entire commercial loan portfolio 
new loan policies and procedures were implemented to augment internal controls and strengthen underwriting practices 
the performance of the company during was severely impacted by loan losses and additional overhead costs associated with interim management  legal services  and collection efforts 
loan charge offs throughout reflected an ongoing assessment of a dynamic loan portfolio

the offering is scheduled to be complete by april  subject to extension to may  see liquidity and capital resources in this item net interest revenue a major share of the company s income results from the spread between income on interest earning assets and interest expense on the liabilities used to fund those assets  known as net interest income 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and amounts and distributions of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding 
net interest margin is net interest income divided by the average earning assets outstanding 
a third frequently used measure is net interest rate spread which is the difference between the average rate earned on assets and the average rate incurred on liabilities without regard to the amounts outstanding in either category 
the consolidated average balance sheets and analysis of net interest income changes compare interest revenue and interest earning assets outstanding with interest cost and liabilities outstanding for the years ended december    and  and computes net interest income  net interest margin and net interest rate spread for each period 
all three of these measures are reported on a taxable equivalent basis

this table shows that the decrease in the company s net interest income during the year to date periods presented from to was generated by a decline in yields and volume on earning assets 
this was partially offset by a decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities

insurance expense was impacted by higher premium rates for federal deposit insurance from the fdic 
deposit premiums for the year are anticipated to be substantially higher due to the bank s risk classification assigned by the fdic 
the balance of intangible assets associated with branches acquired in the early s were written off during the fourth quarter of the write off resulted in the recognition of an additional  in amortization expense for the period 
these intangible assets were primarily associated with the deposits acquired in the new philadelphia market 
given the negative publicity surrounding the schwartz commercial and consumer loans centered in this marketplace and the resulting decline in deposits  the bank reevaluated the remaining intangible assets and determined that it would write off the balance

credit evaluations of borrowers are performed to ensure that loans are granted on a sound basis 
in addition  care is taken to minimize risk by diversifying specific industry 
however  due to the decline in the bank s capital level  the bank has several concentrations of credit which are more fully described in footnote of the company s financial statements beginning on page f management continuously monitors credit risk through the periodic review of individual credits to ensure compliance with policies and procedures 
adequate collateralization  contractual guarantees  and compensating balances are also utilized by management to mitigate risk 
management determines the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan losses by continually evaluating the quality of the loan portfolio 
the reserve is allocated to specific loans that exhibit above average credit loss potential based upon their payment history and the borrowers financial conditions 
the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses is evaluated based on an assessment of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this assessment results in an allowance consisting of two components  allocated and unallocated 
the allocations are made for analytical purposes 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
management maintains a watch list of substandard loans for monthly review 
although these loans may not be delinquent and may be adequately secured  management believes that due to location  size  or past payment history  it is necessary to monitor these loans monthly 
the allowance for possible loan losses totaled  or of total loans and leases at december  at the end of the previous year  the allowance for possible loan losses was  or of total loans and leases 
the provision for loan losses charged to expense during was  compared to  in the year ago period 
as previously disclosed  the bank has taken charge offs beginning with the fourth quarter of due principally to its relationship with schwartz homes  inc  a retailer of mobile homes based in new philadelphia  ohio and retail customers of schwartz homes 
the bank made loans to schwartz home s retail customers under recourse agreements with schwartz homes 
under these recourse agreements  schwartz homes agreed to repay any loans not repaid by retail customers 
schwartz homes apparently used the funds advanced by the bank to fund its own operations or for other improper purposes  without the knowledge of the bank s board 
in many instances  schwartz homes failed to perform on the retail sales contracts it entered into with its customers even though the bank had provided the funds to schwartz homes for this purpose 
in addition  schwartz homes often failed to repay the floor plan lenders on homes purchased  which further impacted the bank s collateral position with respect to the homes 
on april   schwartz homes unexpectedly ceased operations and on june  other creditors of schwartz homes placed it in involuntary bankruptcy 
of the million in net charge offs for the year ended december   million were related to schwartz homes loans 
of this million amount  million in net charge offs were related to the indirect consumer loans to schwartz homes customers  and million in net charge offs were related to commercial loans made directly to schwartz homes 
the following table depicts the net charge offs for the schwartz homes loans for each quarter of net recoveries are expressed parenthetically consumer commercial net net expressed in thousands charge offs charge offs total st quarter    nd quarter rd quarter   th quarter charge offs during the first quarter of for the schwartz consumer and commercial loan relationship were based on an analysis prepared by the office of the comptroller of the currency with the assistance of management 
net charge offs during the first quarter of were  for the schwartz indirect consumer homebuilder loans and  for the commercial loan relationship 
during the third quarter of  the bank released or was in the process of releasing approximately half of the nearly consumer borrowers from any or part of their obligation to the bank 
in addition  ongoing work to obtain better collateral valuations and to determine collateral position was progressing 
as a result   in net charge offs on the schwartz consumer homebuilder loans were recognized during the third quarter of also  the specific allocation of the loan loss reserve was increased from  at june  to  at september   principally as a result of this ongoing analysis 
for the reserve allocation  management assumed a more conservative approach giving a higher probability that the floorplan lenders would receive funding from the bankruptcy trustee on the consumer closed loans prior to the bank due to the increasing complexity of the overall legal issues surrounding the matter 
the charge off of  for the second quarter of associated with the schwartz commercial loans was recorded when the bankruptcy court determined that the floor plan lenders had perfected first and second lien positions on new inventory securing the loans 
charge offs for the schwartz commercial loan relationship totaling  for the third quarter of occurred when the bank obtained a current appraisal on the real estate for schwartz homes  inc the bank charged off a total of  to reduce the loan balance to of the appraised value 
also  the bankruptcy court granted one of the floor plan lenders a motion for relief from the automatic stay to repossess units that were non consumer claimed and were not floor planned 
the bank s attorneys also confirmed that the floor plan lenders had a valid first and second lien position on equipment and fixtures 
as a result  the bank charged off an additional  the real estate for schwartz homes  inc was sold during the fourth quarter of the sale resulted in a modest recovery 
charge offs for the fourth quarter of included  in loans related to the amusement industry  million for a manufacturer and  for an operator in the amusement industry 
there are no indirect lending programs in the current loan portfolio that are structured in the same manner as the schwartz homebuilder program 
in addition  management believes that all industry and borrower concentrations have been adequately identified 
management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses based on estimates of incurred loan losses is set forth in the table below allocation of the allowance for loan losses expressed in thousands domestic commercial  financial and agricultural      commercial real estate residential mortgage consumer foreign unallocated total      loans outstanding as a percentage of each loan category are depicted in the following table commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage commercial real estate installment loans to individuals obligations of political subdivisions in th e us lease financing total the following table sets forth the five year historical information on the allowance for possible loan losses expressed in thousands balance as of january      provision for loan losses     loans charged off real estate commercial  consumer   direct financing leases total loans charged off   recoveries of loans previously charged off real estate commercial consumer direct financing leases total recoveries net charge offs recoveries   balance at december      expressed in thousands loans and leases outstanding at december      allowance as a percent of loans and leases outstanding average loans and leases      net charge offs as a percent of average loans and leases the following schedule shows the five year history of non performing assets

the balance of loans classified by management as substandard due to delinquency and a change in financial position at the end of and not included in the table above was  deposits primarily  core deposits are used to fund interest earning assets 
the company has a lower volume of interest free checking accounts than its national peer group which is typical for its market area 
this results in an overall higher cost of funds than national peer average 
the accompanying tables show the relative composition of the company s average deposits and the change in average deposit sources during the last three years expressed in thousands average deposits demand    interest bearing checking    savings    other time    certificates  and over    total average deposits    distribution of average deposits demand interest bearing checking savings other time certificates  and over total change in average deposit sources to to to demand   interest bearing checking    savings  other time   certificates  and over   total    borrowings other sources of funds for the company include short term repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank borrowings 
liquidity and capital resources the company meets its liability based needs through the operation of the bank s branch banking network that gathers demand and retail time deposits 
the bank also acquires funds through repurchase agreements and overnight federal funds that provide additional sources of liquidity 
total deposits decreased by million  or  from the end of to approximately million of this decline can be attributed to a reduction in account balances for a single public depository 
in addition  in january  deposits of the jewett  ohio branch office totaling million were sold 
average deposits decreased million  or  during compared to during  the bank did not aggressively price deposits in an effort to reduce the size of the bank to assist in capital planning 
the bank also has lines of credit with various correspondent banks totaling  which may be used as an alternative funding source  none of these lines were drawn upon at december  in addition  the bank has a repurchase agreement based line of credit with the federal home loan bank of cincinnati for million  at december   the outstanding balance of this line was million 
in february  the federal home loan bank reduced the maximum amount the bank could borrow on the line to million with an additional line of million on a temporary basis not to exceed three consecutive days 
all borrowings at the federal home loan bank are subject to eligible collateral requirements 
liquidity may be impacted by the ability of the company to generate earnings in the future and to raise additional capital as discussed below 
at december   shareholders equity was  compared to  at december   a decrease of  the decrease in capital during was due to the losses incurred by the company as previously described 
in addition  the market value of securities available for sale  net of tax  declined by approximately million from the year ago period due principally to the increase in interest rates during the federal reserve board has adopted risk based capital guidelines that assign risk weightings to assets and off balance sheet items 
the guidelines also define and set minimum capital requirements risk based capital ratios 
bank holding companies are required to have core capital tier of at least of risk weighted assets and total capital of of risk weighted assets 
tier capital consists principally of shareholders equity less goodwill  and a portion of deferred tax assets 
total capital consists of tier i capital  plus certain debt instruments and a portion of the reserve for loan losses 
the following table shows several capital and liquidity ratios for the company for the last two years december average shareholders equity to average assets average deposits average loans and leases primary capital risk based capital ratio tier total leverage ratio the bank s capital ratios are detailed in footnote of the notes to the consolidated statements in the company s financial statements beginning on page f as previously described under item  business consent order and federal reserve bank agreement  and regulation  the company has entered into an agreement with the federal reserve bank and the office of the comptroller of the currency to restore the bank s capital by march  and thereafter maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least 
as part of the plan to improve its capital ratios  management has reduced the assets of the bank and has offered stock for sale through a shareholders rights offering and simultaneous ancillary offering to other interested investors 
both offerings are scheduled to terminate april   subject to potential extension of the ancillary offering to may  the comptroller of the currency has required the bank to limit the amount of deferred tax assets that the bank includes in tier capital 
as a result of this limitation and the loss incurred for the fourth quarter of  the bank s tier capital at december  was million and its tier leverage ratio was 
at this level of capitalization  the bank is currently regarded as significantly undercapitalized under regulatory prompt corrective action requirements 
the bank was unable to achieve the tier capital level by march  as required under the terms of the consent order 
in an effort to satisfy this requirement  in february  the company commenced a rights offering and a simultaneous ancillary offering of its common stock to existing stockholders and others to raise up to million 
the company did not conclude the offerings as originally anticipated on march  but extended the offerings until april   and intends to continue the ancillary offering upon the filing and effectiveness of a post effective amendment to its registration statement 
to date the company has received subscriptions to purchase approximately  shares of its common stock at per share million in the aggregate 
the subscription proceeds are to be released to the company on or about april  there can be no assurance that the sec will declare effective an amendment to the company s registration statement to permit a continuation of the ancillary offering  or  if it does  that the company will raise the capital required during the period in which such offering is continued to enable the bank to achieve the specified tier capital level 
in order to achieve a tier leverage ratio of  the bank will need approximately million in additional capital after taking into account the subscriptions for million received to date in the offering and million invested by the directors prior to the offering 
at march   the bank s unaudited tier leverage ratio was 
at april   its estimated tier leverage ratio  including the proceeds from the offering  was 
while this does not meet the tier leverage ratio required under the consent order  the ratio achieved would satisfy the adequately capitalized required under regulatory prompt corrective action if determined independently of the consent order 
on march   the bank advised the comptroller of the currency that it would not achieve the specified tier capital level by march  and submitted a revised capital restoration plan which sets forth other means to achieve the objectives  including by seeking to raise additional capital though an extension of the offering or by selling additional assets or deposits 
to date  the comptroller of the currency has not taken action on the capital restoration plan submitted 
if belmont does not raise sufficient capital  the comptroller of the currency could take various actions or mandate that the bank take specified actions  including the following it could continue to monitor the bank s operations as it is currently doing and allow the bank more time to improve its capital position 
it could assume a more active supervisory role and require the bank to implement changes in its business model or management 
it could assume complete control of the management of the bank and seek to identify a strategic buyer to purchase its assets or liquidate its assets 
the federal reserve bank of cleveland could take similar actions under its agreement with belmont 
if the comptroller of the currency and federal reserve bank of cleveland assume complete or significantly greater control of the bank s or belmont s operations or mandate a sale of all of their assets  it is likely that such actions could have an adverse effect on the value of belmont s shares

dividends the following table presents dividend payout ratios for the past three years total dividends declared as a percentage of net income n a n a common dividends declared as a percentage of earnings per common share n a n a cash dividends were declared and paid in the amount of per share in prior to the company s determination that it would not realize positive earnings for the year 
dividends of per share were paid in future dividends will require approval of the company s regulators 
the subsidiary bank is the primary source of funds to pay dividends to the shareholders of belmont 
the approval of the comptroller of the currency will be required for future dividends from the bank to belmont because previously paid dividends have exceeded the total of the bank s retained net profits for the current and preceding two years 
the board of governors of the federal reserve bank has issued a policy statement stating that a bank holding company generally should not maintain its existing rate of cash dividends on common stock unless the organization s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition 
belmont has ceased payment of a cash dividend until the it achieves a certain level of profitability and capital 
year as described in the company s annual report on form k a for the year ended december  and its quarterly reports on form q or q a for the quarters ended march   june  and september   during  belmont examined its operating systems for year compliance 
since entering the year  belmont has not experienced any significant disruptions to its business by reason of any year problems 
belmont will continue to monitor its critical systems over the next several months  but does not anticipate any significant year impact on its business 
belmont did not incur significant incremental costs in seeking to become year compliant

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
the company s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results from timing differences in the repricing of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  changes in relationships between rate indices and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options 
the asset liability management committee alco meets regularly to review the interest rate sensitivity position of the company and to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
the goal of asset liability management is to maximize net interest income and the net value of the company s future cash flows within the interest rate risk limits established by the board of directors 
interest rate risk is monitored primarily through the use of two complementary measures earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of these interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the company 
the key assumptions underlying these measures are periodically reviewed by alco 
based on the earnings simulation model at december   changes in net interest income were projected as follows given a parallel shift in the yield curve change in change net interest in net interest expressed in thousands income income down basis points down basis points up basis points up basis points the change in the estimated present value of equity as a percentage of the total market value of equity was given a basis point increase in interest rates
