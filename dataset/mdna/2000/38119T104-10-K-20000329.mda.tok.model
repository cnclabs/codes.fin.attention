the following contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the us securities laws 
actual results  performance or achievements of the company could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly these forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
results of operations overview on september   the company and anvil mining nl  an australian company anvil  completed the acquisition of and respectively  of the common shares of bogoso gold limited bgl 
the government of ghana retained its equity interest in bgl 
bgl is the owner of the bogoso mine  an operating gold mine in the republic of ghana  which the company and anvil intend to continue to operate 
the initial purchase price for bgl was million  which was funded by the company from working capital and the proceeds from the august  offerings of convertible debentures  common shares and warrants 
the acquisition agreement also provides for additional purchase price payments to the ifc on behalf of the consortium of banks that sold bogoso 
the company and anvil also acquired by way of assignment all the outstanding debt owed to the sellers 
the company will receive preferential repayment of its acquisition costs  including the amount owed to it by anvil  and all inter company debt and interest will be repaid prior to any distribution to shareholders 
the acquisition of bgl included the assignment of certain rights to golden star and anvil of certain indebtedness of bgl to the sellers 
the indebtedness to anvil at the purchase date approximated million and will be repaid at such time as net proceeds  as defined  from bgl production are available to fund the debt 
management estimates that  due to the provisions of the acquisition agreement that grant golden star first preference on cash flow from bgl until it has recovered its investment in bgl  including its related purchase costs  transaction expenses and repayment of the anvil note receivable  that it is unlikely that any of the indebtedness will be repaid to anvil 
accordingly  no liability was recorded upon purchase of bgl 
as of december   management continues to believe that it is unlikely that any indebtedness will be repaid to anvil 
this acquisition is consistent with the company s shift in focus away from being a pure exploration company  to becoming a production  development and advanced stage exploration company 
the company s results of operations  discussed below  include results from bgl for the three months ended december  prior to september   the company s focus was solely on the exploration and development if warranted of precious metal and diamond deposits within specific geological domains 
under cdn gaap  expenditures relating to these activities are capitalized in recognition of the potential future value of prospective targets 
upon completion of the exploration phase  and upon a decision to proceed to the development phase  these accumulated expenditures reflect the cost of the resultant reserves that will be depleted on the units of production basis over the estimated total reserve to be mined 
a decision to discontinue exploration or not to proceed to the development stage for a specific project would result in reducing the capitalized total cost of the exploration program and charging those costs against income 
under us gaap  exploration and general and administrative expenses related to projects are charged to expense as incurred  whereas under cdn gaap  such expenses are capitalized as discussed above 
property acquisition costs are deferred under both canadian and us gaap until it is determined whether a project is commercially feasible 
in addition  under us gaap  internal acquisition costs are charged to expense as incurred  whereas under cdn gaap such amounts are capitalized 
the effect of the differences in accounting under cdn gaap and us gaap on the statement of net loss is as follows for the years ended december  net loss under cdn gaap    net effect of the deferred exploration expenditures on loss for the period    effect of capitalized acquisition costs net of related depletion  other loss under us gaap before minority interest    minority interest  as adjusted   net loss under us gaap    other comprehensive income foreign exchange loss comprehensive income    basic and diluted net loss per share under us gaap the company currently has limited cash resources 
see item risk factors we currently have limited liquidity and capital resources and liquidity and capital resources and outlook below 
compared to the company reported a net loss of million in as compared to a net loss of million in the most significant aspects of the results were the revenue and operating costs from gold production at the bogoso mine which was acquired on september   and the impact of property abandonment charges and write downs of million in compared with million in the write downs on exploration properties totaled million for properties in suriname  million for properties in guyana  million for properties in french guiana  million for properties in brazil  and million for properties in africa 
the write downs in were due to the fundamental shift in the direction and focus of the company from a pure exploration company  to a production  development and advanced stage exploration company 
with the consummation of the acquisition of bgl  the company completed the first major objective of management s shift of the company s focus 
also  as a result of the shift of focus and with the prioritization of available funding  the company must continually consolidate and rationalize exploration and development activities  which could impact its corporate and project budgets 
available funds will be more focused on the development and acquisition of advanced stage exploration projects  rather than on grass roots projects 
during  the company undertook a review of the carrying value of all of its exploration properties and  as a result  the company expensed million for the write down or abandonment of several projects and prospecting licenses 
a number of these properties will be retained and could be actively explored in the future  but the write down reflects their present potential  in view of the continuing low gold price and depressed markets for gold equities 
total revenues in were million  of which million came from revenue from gold sales 
the bogoso mine produced and sold  ounces of gold during the three months ended december   with an average per ounce gold price realized and total cash costs of per ounce 
depreciation and depletion expense increased to million from million  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the bogoso mine in september interest and other revenues of million were comparable to the amount of million 
general and administrative expenditures totaled million in  as compared to million for the decrease in general and administrative expenditures resulted from the company s ongoing cost reduction efforts 
compared to the company reported a net loss of million in as compared to a net loss of million in during  the company recorded property abandonment charges of million  including million and million  respectively  from the relinquishment of certain diamond and gold properties in guyana  million for the dieu merci project in french guiana  million for the andorinhas project  million for other properties in brazil  and million related to various property interests in bolivia 
the abandonment of these projects was the result of several factors including exploration results and the assessment and prioritization of exploration projects by management to ensure continued focus on the most promising projects in the company s portfolio in light of limited capital available to fund exploration projects 
the objective of the project prioritization was to ensure continued funding of projects that the company believed offered the greatest potential for meaningful results and new reserves and mineralized material 
of the million of property abandonments described above  million were recorded in the fourth quarter of the abandonments taken in the fourth quarter resulted from the company s review of exploration results to date  prioritization of projects  and results of negotiations with property owners 
total revenues in decreased to million  as compared to million in due to the shutdown during of the alluvial mining operations at sotrapmag in april and the lower interest income earned 
interest and other revenues decreased from million in to million in due to the decrease in the average cash balance invested during as compared to combined with lower interest rates during the period 
cost of mining operations were nil for as compared to million for as a result of the discontinuation of production at sotrapmag during  with no revenue from gold sales in  compared to revenue of million in sotrapmag s cost of mining operations exceeded revenues in by million 
general and administrative expenditures totaled million for  as compared to million for the decrease in general and administrative expenditures resulted from a million reduction in expenses due to the company s cost reduction efforts offset by the million paid to the former president and ceo of the company under a separation and release agreement 
depreciation expense decreased million as a result of the decrease in the depreciable asset base due to the write down of equipment at sotrapmag 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash and short term investments as of december  were million  down from million as of december  this reduction is the net result of the issuance of convertible debentures and common shares  the acquisition of bgl  the generation of net cash from bgl operations and ongoing expenditures on mineral exploration properties 
working capital as of december  had decreased to million from the level of million at december   mainly as a result of the additional receivables and inventories from the producing mine at bgl offset by the addition of the current portion of the amount payable to financial institutions 
the company anticipates that its current cash balance and the operating cash flows from the bogoso mine will be sufficient to fund planned operating and exploration expenditures for the year cash used in investing activities of million in increased from million in the decrease in exploration expenditures related to the company s operations in south america and africa was more than offset by expenditures for the bogoso acquisition and the environmental rehabilitation bonding 
cash provided by financing activities in increased to million from million in this increase results from the net effect of the following increased cash from the issuance of shares million in compared with million from the exercise of warrants in  cash from the issuance of convertible debentures in of million with zero in and million in cash received in from ogml with zero in as an interest free loan to be repaid at the same time as ogml preferred shares are redeemed 
the company received million in cash through the acquisition of bgl but million is restricted  in accordance with the bgl acquisition agreement  to be used for environmental rehabilitation at the bogoso mine 
the restricted cash is therefore deducted from cash flows and is not included in the cash and short term investments at the end of the year 
on august   the company filed with the sec a shelf registration statement on form s  with respect to the proposed issuance by the company from time to time of up to  of its common shares  preferred shares  convertible debt securities and or warrants

the debentures  which mature on august   bear interest at per annum and are convertible at the option of the holder at a conversion price of per share 
the debentures are also redeemable by the company under certain circumstances and each principal amount of  entitles the holder to warrants exercisable for common shares at a price of per share for three years and per share for the fourth and fifth years 
the purpose of the issuance of the equity and convertible debt units  issued under the company s shelf registration statement in the united states dated august   was to raise funds for the acquisition of bgl 
in anticipation of the bgl acquisition  the company established a credit facility that was not used in the transaction 
as consideration for setting up this facility  the company issued three year warrants to purchase  common shares the credit facility warrants 
the credit facility warrants were originally priced at per share but  as per the credit facility agreement  they were re priced in october to per share 
the company filed a registration statement on form s on october   covering the credit facility warrants and the brokers warrants  which is not yet effective 
bogoso gold limited production from the bogoso mine amounted to  ounces for the last quarter of  the first quarter of its operations under the company 
the realized gold price was per ounce and  with total cash costs of per ounce  bogoso generated positive cash flow to the company

the company wrote off deferred project expenditures of million in following management s decision to release prospecting licenses and property agreements on the various properties 
this compares with million of property abandonment charges in the company plans to close the guyana office in and has only budgeted approximately million for administration expenses and limited exploration in guyana during suriname activities in suriname during focused principally on the gross rosebel gold project held in joint venture with cambior 
total gross rosebel spending in amounted to million offset by joint venture recoveries of million  as compared to spending of million  which was offset by joint venture recoveries of million

in august  the company announced the results of its scoping study for a smaller  less capital intensive development plan at gross rosebel 
these results supported the company s belief that the project could be profitably developed in a low gold price environment by applying a low cost heap leach processing approach 
budgeted exploration and acquisition expenditures for gross rosebel are million  with budgeted joint venture recoveries of million 
expenditures at the gross rosebel project are shared equally between the company and cambior 
at such time as the decision is made to proceed with the development of gross rosebel  the company will evaluate various funding alternatives including the issuance of debt or equity securities or the sale of other assets to fund its share of the development costs 
brazil during  the company spent approximately million on exploration compared with million in the company recorded write downs totaling million in for all its remaining brazilian properties  following property write downs of million in the write downs were a result of poor exploration results and management s decision to reduce exploration expenditures

effects of the european monetary union currency effective january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european monetary union emu adopted a single european currency  the euro  as their common legal currency 
during the years through  business conducted within the emu will be conducted in both the existing national currency and the euro 
as a result  companies operating in emu member states will need to ensure that their financial systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handle these currencies  including the euro 
the operations of the company s owned subsidiary guyanor ressources sa are affected by this change 
the company has not had and does not expect a material impact on its results of operations from foreign currency gains or losses as a result of the transition to the euro 
other matters the company conducts all of its operations  exploration and development of mineral properties in countries other than canada and the united states directly and through joint ventures 
to date  the majority of the company s funding had come from equity financing transactions completed in canada and in canadian currency 
the company currently maintains all or the majority of its working capital in us dollars or us dollar denominated securities and its practice has been to converts funds to foreign currencies as payment obligations come due 
accordingly  the company is subject to fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the us dollar and other currencies  and such fluctuations may materially affect the company s financial position and results of operations

these funds are classified as restricted cash on the december  balance sheet 
management the company has seen significant management changes since october  when david fennell resigned as president and chief executive officer 
james e 
askew was appointed president and chief executive officer in march and  after his work to re focus the company and to acquire the operating bogoso mine  he resigned in october to take a position in his native australia 
mr 
askew continues as a member of the board of directors 
on november   peter j 
bradford was appointed president and chief executive officer 
mr 
bradford was instrumental in bringing the bgl opportunity to the company s attention and  after many years of development and operating gold mining experience including seven years in ghana  he brings appropriate skills to this phase of the company s development 
in addition to mr 
askew  the company s chief financial officer  vice president  corporate development  and controller also resigned during and early these latter resignations mostly resulted from the reorganization and re focusing of the company  combined with the objectives of cost reduction to accommodate the continuing low gold price environment 
the board of directors was also reduced in size during to a level of five directors  all of whom are currently independent of management 
outlook in prior years the company has had to rely primarily on the capital markets to fund its acquisitions  operations and exploration activities 
with the acquisition of bgl and its operating gold mine  effective september   the company now has a source of positive cash flow from mining operations through at least the end of the current market for gold shares continues to be weak and equity capital is difficult to obtain  but  as the company demonstrated in through its capital raising activities from the issuance of shares and convertible debentures  it is somewhat easier to raise funds to acquire producing mining assets compared with the challenge of raising capital primarily for exploration 
the company is projected to generate sufficient cash flow in to cover its exploration obligations and general and administrative expenses  however additional capital would be required for any acquisitions 
the company will continue to explore various possibilities for raising capital  which might include  among other things  the establishment of additional joint ventures  the sale of property interests  debt financing and the issuance of new equity 
whether and to what extent alternative financing options are completed by the company or its subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors including  among others  the successful acquisition of additional properties or projects  the price of gold and management s assessment of the capital markets 
the low gold price adversely affects our ability to obtain financing and therefore our ability to acquire additional properties and to explore and develop our current portfolio of properties 
we cannot assure you that additional funding will be available in we may  in the future  be unable to continue our exploration and development programs and fulfill our obligations under our agreements with our partners or under our permits and licenses 
although we have been successful in the past in obtaining financing though partnership arrangements and sale of equity securities  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to obtain such additional financing  we may need to delay  or indefinitely postpone  further exploration and development of our properties 
as a result we may lose our interest in some of our projects and may be obliged to sell some of our properties 
as at december   the company held consolidated cash and short term investments of million 
management has budgeted consolidated total revenue of approximately million and total operating and general and administrative expenditures of approximately million for consolidated net exploration and development expenditures  after recoveries from joint venture partners and other working capital changes are budgeted at approximately million 
the company has budgeted production from the bogoso mine of  ounces during free cash flow  after all operating expenses  overheads  financing costs  exploration and development  net environmental rehabilitation costs and deferred purchase price repayments to the consortium of banks  is forecast to be between million for the company s planned exploration and development spending during is primarily for the feasibility study on the bogoso sulfide project  the acquisition of additional properties with oxide mineralized material close to bogoso  pre feasibility work at the yaou and dorlin projects  exploration work at paul isnard in french guiana  and continued engineering work at gross rosebel in suriname 
no field work is planned for gross rosebel other than property care and maintenance  however expenditures have been budgeted for additional work on engineering and metallurgical studies on the investigation of heap leaching alternatives and ongoing holding costs of the project 
the company will not receive cash flow from ogml in through redemptions of class i preferred shares  as any redemptions will be utilized to reduce the debt owed to ogml 
the amount of redemptions  if any  is dependent on the net cash flow of ogml 
in  the company booked million from the redemption of class i preferred shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk includes  but is not limited to  the following risks changes in interest rates on the company s investment portfolio  changes in foreign currency exchanges rates and commodity price fluctuations 
the company also has various agreements that are classified as derivative financial instruments 
see also risk factors in part i of this form k 
interest rate risk the company invests its cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers  and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates were to change  the company s revenue could increase or decrease by approximately million for year 
the company may in the future actively manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the price of gold is denominated in us dollars and the majority of the company s revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars 
as a result of the limited exposure  management considers that the company is not exposed to a material risk as a result of any changes in foreign currency exchange rate changes  so the company does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage its exposure 
commodity price risk the company is engaged in gold mining and related activities  including exploration  extraction  processing and reclamation 
gold bullion is the company s primary product and  as a result  changes in the price of gold could significantly affect the company s results of operations and cash flows 
according to current estimates  a change in the price of gold could result in a million effect on the results of operations and cash flows 
the company currently does not have a program for hedging  or in otherwise managing its exposure to commodity price risk 
the company may in the future manage its exposure through hedging programs 
derivative financial instruments the company entered into various agreements in relation to the acquisition of bgl that are classified as derivative financial instruments 
the company and anvil will be required to make additional future payments to the consortium of banks  depending on the then current price of gold and the potential acquisition of ore in ghana outside the region of bgl s mining interests 
the gold price related payments are due as to one year after closing and at the earlier of production of gold ceasing or the second anniversary after closing 
the company is obligated to escrow the estimated payments six months and months after closing  respectively 
these payments are equal to the product in us dollars of  and the amount  if any  that the average daily gold price in us dollars in the london bullion market association us gold fix over the period from closing to the payment dates exceeds per ounce 
such payments are capped at million in total 
the company has accrued million  based on its estimate that  if the gold price averages per ounce for the remainder of the bogoso mine life  golden star and anvil would have to pay the consortium of banks this amount as a purchase price adjustment 
the payment made on the first anniversary of the acquisition will be non refundable and credited against any payment due on the second anniversary 
the company is depleting this amount over production from proven and probable reserves 
the actual amount of the additional purchase price cannot be determined as it could be significantly impacted by changes in the price of gold 
the company is also required to make production related payments to the provider of the credit facility arranged for  but not used  to effect the acquisition of bgl 
the company is required to pay million for every month period that bgl produces over  ounces of gold 
based on proven and probable reserves  the company has accrued million for two years production and is depleting this amount over production from proven and probable reserves 
this payment extends over six years and is capped at million
