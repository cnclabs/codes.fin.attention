merger and acquisition activity the corporation s growth over the past two decades has resulted from both expansion of its existing business and strategic acquisitions of banks with similar operating philosophies 
through external growth  the corporation has extended into four mid atlantic states and has strengthened its presence within existing markets 
while the corporation did not acquire any banks during  it anticipates that acquisitions will continue to be an important strategy in the future 
in  the corporation completed two separate acquisitions 
ambassador bank of the commonwealth

results of operations overview the corporation continued to generate steady earnings growth in net income for the year was million  or per diluted share 
this was an increase of million  or  over net income of million 
diluted net income per share increased over the realized in net income for was million  or  greater than  while diluted net income per share represented an increase of over in the recent earnings trend has been consistent over the past three years and is largely attributable to growth in core banking business  a strong net interest margin  expansion of new products and services  expense controls and good asset quality 
however  certain items that could be considered non recurring in each of the periods are notable 
the table on the following page summarizes net income and adjusts for certain of these items to arrive at core or adjusted net income 
the adjustments shown reflect the after tax impact on net income 
dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net income reported    investment securities gains    merger conversion expenses  adjusted net income    increase over prior year adjusted net income per share diluted increase over prior year investment securities gains and merger expenses are shown as adjustments since many in the industry consider them to be non recurring items 
however  the corporation does have a history of both 
security gains are derived mainly from the corporation s investments in equities of other financial institutions 
gains are realized when  in the opinion of management  the investments have reached full valuation 
given the size of this portfolio million in market value with million in unrealized gains at december   it is probable that the corporation will continue to realize gains in the future 
merger expenses represent professional fees paid to complete mergers 
after adjusting for these items  the corporation s net income still reflects strong growth over the past three years  with net income per share increases of in  in and in in  and  the corporation achieved returns on average assets of  and  respectively  and returns on average shareholders equity of  and 
net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of net income 
the ability to manage net interest income over a variety of interest rate and economic environments is critical to the success of a banking entity 
net interest income growth is dependent upon the growth of the corporation s balance sheet while maintaining the net interest margin 
see also the discussion of interest rate risk later in this section 
net interest income for was million  a million  or  increase over this compares to a increase of million  or  to million 
in terms of fully taxable equivalent fte net interest income  which includes the net tax benefit of investments in tax exempt assets  the increase was million  or  as compared to a increase of million  or 
the comparative average balance sheets and net interest income analysis on page and the rate volume table on page summarize the components of net interest income and illustrate variances as a result of changes in interest rates versus growth in assets and liabilities 
in general  the increase was a result of growth in the loan portfolio  funded largely through borrowings as deposit growth was flat 
despite the increase in borrowings  however  the corporation was able to maintain a fairly stable net interest margin  in as compared to in the increase in net interest income was generated by increases in long term borrowings  which were used to purchase investment securities since loan growth was slower 
as with  the use of borrowings for funding purposes had only a moderate impact on net interest margin  which decreased to in from in v 
interest income increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was mainly attributable to volume as average interest earning assets increased million  or  resulting in million of additional interest income 
this was offset by a million reduction in interest income as a result of a basis point drop in average yields on earning assets 
the growth in average interest earning assets occurred mostly in loans  which increased million  or 
commercial loans million  or increase and commercial mortgages  or increase accounted for much of this growth 
in addition  home equity loans million  or increase contributed to an increase in consumer loans as a result of several promotions during the year 
average investment securities increased million  or  mainly in mortgage backed securities million  or increase and tax free municipal investments million  or increase 
in recent years  mortgage backed securities and municipal investments have become the corporation s preferred investment securities 
mortgage backed securities are attractive because of the flexibility in matching cash flows with corporate needs while providing a higher rate of return than traditional government securities 
municipal investments have recently carried taxable equivalent interest rates that are favorable in comparison to taxable alternatives 
the basis point decline in average yields on earning assets reflects the changes in the interest rate environment in general 
the average yield on loans decreased basis points from in to in this decrease corresponds to the decrease in the average prime lending rate  which was in and in  a basis point drop 
in recent years  the prime rate has become a lesser used index for pricing loans than other rates  however  it remains an effective gauge of the overall interest rate environment 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was mainly a function of rates as the average cost of funds decreased basis points  resulting in a million decrease in interest expense 
this was offset by a million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities which generated an million increase in interest expense 
average interest bearing deposits were essentially flat in  registering a slight million  or  decrease 
the decrease in average balances of time deposits million  or  was offset by increases in savings deposits million  or increase and interest bearing demand deposits million  or increase 
total deposit growth continued to be difficult in the face of competition from other financial institutions as well as non bank financial services providers 
rather than simply raising rates to attract time deposit money  the corporation looked to other funding sources 
to support the significant growth in earning assets  the corporation increased its borrowings  both short term and long term 
short term borrowings grew million  or  mainly in federal funds purchased million and customer repurchase agreements million 
to take advantage of favorable long term rates in late and to better match the repricing of its assets  the corporation also increased its long term debt 
average long term debt  which consists of advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb  increased million  or 
average interest rates on interest bearing liabilities decreased in line with the decreases realized on earning assets 
this was reflective of the general interest rate environment 
because of the consistent decline  the corporation s net interest margin remained fairly stable  decreasing only two basis points from in to in v 
interest income increased million  or  from million in to million in of this increase  million was a result of a million  or  increase in average earning assets  offset by a million decrease due to a drop in the average yield from in to in average loans increased million  or  in additional increases were realized in investment securities  which increased million  or  from million in to billion in the basis point decline in the average yield was driven by two primary factors 
first  the average yield on loans decreased basis points to in from in secondly  the mix of interest earning assets changed from loans and investments in to loans and investments in lower yields on investments overall  in and in relative to loans and a higher percentage of investments in caused a further reduction in the overall yield 
the basis point reduction in loan yields was closely correlated with the nine basis point decrease in the corporation s average prime lending rate from to 
interest expense increased million or to million in from million in as with interest income  this increase was mainly volume driven million as average interest bearing liabilities increased million  offset by a million decrease due to a slight decline in rates from in to in average interest bearing deposits showed the largest increase  million or 
most of this increase was in time deposits  which increased million or 
long term debt  which consists mainly of advances from the fhlb  increased million or 
the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased only four basis points  despite the general fall in rates throughout the industry 
this was mainly due to the fact that many of the corporation s deposits in were in certificates of deposit which had not yet realized the impact of rate reductions 
this is shown by the average cost of cd s remaining fairly constant at in comparison to in with interest rates relatively low  the corporation also turned to borrowings as an alternative funding source 
in an effort to reduce rate sensitivity  the corporation locked in longer term borrowings with the fhlb 
the average cost of such borrowings in was approximately as compared to in in general  the cost of these funds was less than comparable term certificates of deposit 
provision and allowance for loan losses additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to income through the provision for loan losses when  in the judgement of management and based on continuing analyses of the loan portfolio  it is believed that the allowance is not adequate 
management considers various factors in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and determining the provision for the period 
among these are charge off history and trends  risk classification of significant credits  adequacy of collateral  the mix and risk characteristics of loan types in the portfolio  and the balance of the allowance relative to total and non performing loans 
additional consideration is given to regional and national economic conditions 
the tables below summarize non performing assets including accruing loans greater than days past due and net charge offs by major loan category as of or for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands 
nonperforming assets amount change amount change amount change real estate loans    commercial industrial loans    consumer loans    other real estate owned   total    non performing assets total assets non performing loans total loans net charge offs amount change amount change amount change real estate loans na commercial industrial loans   consumer loans    total    net charge offs average loans the provision for loan losses for increased million  or  to million  as compared to million in the provision was million  or lower than the provision of million 
in both and  the provision was consistent with the net charge offs recognized during the years million in and million in 
to understand the increase in the provision in  it is necessary to understand the higher net charge off levels 
in  net charge offs were of average loans outstanding as compared to in the increase resulted from the continued trend toward higher levels of losses on consumer loans 
consumer loan charge offs continued to increase as a result of further aging of the indirect loan portfolio  which grew dramatically in the mid to late s 
in the past year  indirect lending has experienced lower growth rates as the corporation has faced increased rate competition 
despite the recent decrease  the existing loan portfolio continued to experience losses  resulting in higher consumer charge offs in  and  further increasing the need for provisions for losses 
despite the increase in charge offs in  the quality of the overall consumer portfolio continued to show signs of improvement 
total non performing consumer loans million in vs 
million in  non performing consumer loans as a percentage of total non performing loans in vs 
in  and non performing consumer loans to total consumer loans in vs 
in all improved over the past year 
improvements in overall asset quality measures also occurred in overall  total non performing assets improved to of total assets at december  as compared to at the end of the corporation s periodic loan portfolio review and allowance calculations resulted in of the total balance being allocated to specific loans and loan types at december  as compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans declined from at december  to at december  management believes that the allowance balance of million at december  is sufficient to cover losses incurred in the loan portfolio and is appropriate based on applicable accounting standards 
other income noninterest income was million in  a million  or  increase over excluding investment securities gains of million in and million in  the increase in other income was million  or 
excluding the impact of securities gains  other income increased million  or  in as compared to in recent years  the corporation has focused on increasing its non margin related sources of income 
as a result of increased emphasis on fee income  investment management and trust services income grew million  or  in to million  following an increase of million  or  in the growth over the past two years was fueled by the rollout of investment and brokerage services to all eleven of the corporation s affiliate banks as well as additional emphasis on traditional trust products 
in  the corporation will consolidate all of the investment management and trust services units at each of its affiliate banks into a newly formed trust company 
this company  which will be a non bank subsidiary of the parent  will continue offering its existing services and will add  through an affiliate  life insurance to its menu of products 
coordinating efforts under a centralized structure is expected to further the corporation s fee based income goals 
service charges on deposits increased million  or  to million in cash management fees  or increase grew as the number of cash management accounts continued to increase 
the corporation has emphasized this business to newer affiliates who may not have offered it in the past 
overdraft fees  or increase and other service charges on deposits  or increase also increased as a result of changes in fee structures and an increase in demand and savings accounts  which account for the majority of these fee types 
in  service charges on deposits grew million  or  mainly due to deposit growth 
other service charges and fees increased  or  to million in  following an increase of million  or  in in  the corporation realized an increase of million in atm convenience fees as a result of their introduction in late as a result of a full year of such fees in both and  the increase was only  or  in the remainder of the increase was mainly in debit card revenues  which increased  or  due to the continued emphasis of this product at the corporation s newer affiliate banks 
mortgage banking income decreased  or  in after increasing million  or  in this fluctuation was mainly a result of interest rates 
as mortgage rates continued to drop throughout  refinance activity increased and the corporation was able to recognize million in gains on mortgage loan sales  a million  or  increase over in  as rates began rising  mortgage loan sale gains decreased  or  to million 
this decrease was somewhat offset by a  or  increase in mortgage loan servicing income which grew as a result of retaining the servicing on many of the sold loans 
investment securities gains decreased million  or  to million in following an increase of  or  to million in the equity investment portfolio consists of common stocks of financial institutions in the corporation s general geographical market area 
in  bank stock values were generally higher than in  resulting in higher gains realized in relative to as previously discussed  management monitors the corporation s equity portfolio and makes periodic sale and investment decisions based on its assessment of the investments values 
other expenses noninterest expenses for increased million  or  to million 
this followed a increase of million  or  to million 
total noninterest expenses in were million 
excluding the impact of merger expenses in and  total noninterest expenses increased million  or  in and million  or  in the corporation s efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of noninterest expenses to fully taxable equivalent revenues excluding securities gains  improved to in  as compared to in  excluding merger expenses and in  excluding merger expenses 
the largest component of noninterest expenses  salaries and employee benefits  increased million  or  in to million  as compared to a million  or  increase to million in the salary portion of the expense was million  which was a million  or  increase over this resulted from a small increase in average full time equivalent fte employees to  in from  in  as well as normal merit increases 
the salary portion of the expense in was million  a million  or  increase over this resulted from an increase in average fte employees from  in to  in  as well as normal merit increases 
employee benefits expense increased million  or  to million in  following a increase of  or 
the sharper increase in reflected a  or  increase in health care expenses and a net increase of  in retirement plan costs as certain affiliate banks provided this benefit to their employees for the first time and certain employees were transitioned from the defined benefit plan to the profit sharing plan 
this transition resulted in some overlap of expenses from the two plans and the cost is expected to decrease in future periods 
net occupancy expense increased  or  in after decreasing  or  in the decrease was due to consolidation of branches and operations facilities following the acquisition of lebanon valley 
the increase reflects growth in the branch network and the completion of a major renovation at the corporation s operations center 
in  the corporation began the construction of a million   square foot office building in downtown lancaster  pa 
this building  which will be adjacent to the corporation s existing main office  will be used to accommodate current and future occupancy needs of the corporation 
in the first several years  however  a portion of the facility will be leased to third parties 
construction is expected to be completed by the end of equipment expense increased  or  in following a decrease of  or  in as with occupancy expense  the variances in equipment expense were a result of contracting operations in overlapping markets in  followed by strategic expansion in equipment expense also increased as a result of year related needs 
special services expense  which is the cost of data processing  increased  or in  compared to a million  or  increase in the corporation has a contract with a third party to perform the main data processing functions for all of the corporation s affiliate banks 
the increase in was mainly the result of converting the newly acquired lebanon valley from its in house data processing function to the corporation s third party systems 
in addition  a new mortgage processing system and a new trust system were installed in  which resulted in increased costs 
other noninterest expenses decreased million  or  to million in as compared to million in this was mainly due to certain nonrecurring expenses in the corporation incurred approximately million in professional fees related to the acquisitions of keystone and ambassador in  whereas in there were no merger related expenses 
in  the corporation also made approximately  in net non equity contributions related to low income housing projects 
also  net expenses related to the corporate owned life insurance program were reduced from  in to zero in as the program was modified to a non leveraged structure 
finally  many categories of expenses which indirectly increased in as a result of merger related costs decreased to normal levels in among these were advertising  or  decrease in  legal fees  or decrease and supplies  or decrease 
income taxes income taxes increased only  or  in as compared to a million  or  increase in the effective tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
in general  the variances from the federal statutory rate consisted of tax exempt interest income  investments in low and moderate income housing partnerships which qualify for federal tax credits  and certain merger related expenses which are not deductible 
the decrease in the effective tax rate reflects no merger expenses in  an increase in tax free municipal investments and an increase in tax credits to million in from in see also note h income taxes in the consolidated financial statements

the table above highlights the trends in the balance sheet over the past two years 
because annual averages tend to conceal trends and ending balances can be distorted by one day fluctuations  the december monthly averages for each of the last three years are provided to give a better indication of trends in the balance sheet 
all references within the discussion that follows are to these december average balances unless specifically noted otherwise 
the corporation s balance sheet continued to grow in  as assets increased million  or  to billion  as compared to billion at the end of asset growth in was million  or 
in  the balance sheet growth was asset driven  mostly through increases in loans 
in  the balance sheet grew mainly as a result of funding strategies that increased the corporation s long term borrowings 
loans loans outstanding net of unearned income increased million  or  in to reach a level of billion 
in  the growth rate was much slower at million  or 
in  the growth was most evident in commercial loans million  or  increase  commercial mortgages million  or  increase and home equity loans million  or  increase 
commercial loans and mortgages were impacted by favorable economic conditions in the corporation s markets as well as competitive pricing decisions 
home equity loans benefited from several promotions during furthermore  the overall loan growth rate was aided by a slowing of residential mortgage refinancings as interest rates rose during the year 
although residential mortgages remained flat in  the run off from refinancing activity that had been seen in prior years slowed 
in  the corporation was able to increase commercial mortgages million  or  but almost all other major loan categories remained flat or saw decreases 
consumer loans  consisting of automobile financing  student loans  credit cards and home equity loans  increased only million  or 
commercial loans decreased million  or  and residential mortgages decreased million  or  due to heavy refinance volume 
investment securities in  investment securities decreased million  or  to billion 
this followed a increase of million  or 
in  maturities and payoffs of securities were used as one source of funds for the growing loan portfolio 
conversely  in  excess funds provided by borrowings and deposit growth were used to purchase securities as loan growth was slower 
the decrease in investment securities during occurred in all categories of investments  except for tax exempt municipal securities which continued to have favorable taxable equivalent rates as compared to other investment alternatives 
tax exempt municipal securities increased million  or  to million and now account for approximately of the corporation s investment portfolio 
mortgage backed securities  which decreased million  or  during  continue to account for the majority of the investment portfolio  at 
the corporation classified approximately of its investment securities billion as available for sale and  as such  these investments are recorded at their estimated fair values 
the increase in interest rates during resulted in a million decrease in unrealized gains on non equity investments in the portfolio 
the corporation prefers the available for sale classification as it provides flexibility in managing liquidity needs 
the corporation also maintains an equity investment portfolio  consisting of fhlb and other government agency stock million  as well as stocks of other financial institutions million 
this portfolio has historically been a source of capital appreciation and realized gains million in  million in and million in 
management periodically sells bank stocks when valuations and market conditions warrant such sales 
premises and equipment premises and equipment increased million  or  in to million  following a million  or increase in increases were mainly a result of capital investments in technology  the renovation of the corporation s operations facility and the commencement of construction of a new office building adjacent to the corporation s current main office in lancaster 
cash and due from banks cash and due from banks increased million  or  to million in december  furthermore  vault cash increased million  or  to million 
in anticipation of customer demand for funds as a result of year concerns  the corporation maintained higher than normal balances of cash near the end of the year 
demand for cash was not significant and these reserves were reinvested in early january  see also year for additional disclosures about the year issues 
other assets other assets increased million  or  in to million 
this compares to a million  or  increase in the increase in was mainly a result of the net deferred tax asset  which grew million 
this was caused by the million decrease in the unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities  and the resulting decline in the related deferred tax liability 
the increase in resulted from the payoff of the million loan on the corporate owned life insurance coli program 
this loan was recorded as a reduction to the accumulated cash surrender value on the life insurance policies 
during  the corporation continued its participation in affordable housing and community development projects through investments in partnerships 
equity commitments totaling million were made to two new projects 
the corporation made its initial investment of this type during and is now involved in projects  all located in the communities served by its subsidiary banks 
the carrying value of these investments was approximately million at december  with these investments  the corporation not only improves the quantity and quality of available housing for low income individuals in support of its banks community reinvestment act compliance effort  but also becomes eligible for tax credits under federal and  in some cases  state programs 
deposits and borrowings deposits increased million  or  in to a total of billion 
this compares to an increase of million  or  in competition for time deposits  which is mainly focused on interest rates  resulted in a decrease of million  or  in and million  or  in most notably  certificates of deposit with original maturities of less than one year decreased million  or  in and million  or  in demand and savings deposits  however  did see increases in both million  or and million  or 
with reasonable funding alternatives available  the corporation has avoided simply paying the highest rates to attract new time deposits 
short term borrowings  consisting mainly of federal funds purchased and customer and broker repurchase agreements  increased million  or  in to million after remaining flat in federal funds purchased increased million  customer repurchase agreements increased million and broker repurchase agreements increased million 
long term debt  which consists of advances from the fhlb  increased million  or in  following a million  or  increase in the dramatic increase in resulted from favorable long term rates and a need to better match maturities in conjunction with the corporation s asset liability management strategies 
in  short term borrowing was relatively more attractive than longer term 
the increases in both short and long term borrowings over the past two years underscores the difficulty that the corporation and financial institutions in general have had in generating deposit growth 
although these borrowings have had little impact in the short term on the net interest margin  the corporation will continue to target deposits as its primary funding source in the future 
deposits  especially demand and savings  are generally less costly and provide an opportunity to expand the existing customer base 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased million  or  to million at december  this compares to an increase of million  or  in the slower rate of increase in reflects two main changes 
first  the reduction in the fair value of the corporation s non equity investments resulted in a shift from million in unrealized gains in to million in unrealized losses at december  second  as a result of three separate stock repurchase plans in  treasury stock increased million 
excluding treasury stock and accumulated other comprehensive loss gain  shareholders equity increased million  or 
this resulted from strong net income growth as well as a prudent dividend policy 
despite increasing dividends each year per share in and per share in  the corporation maintained a dividend payout ratio in the range of in the first stock repurchase plan expired march  and was for  shares  of which  were purchased during the second plan was approved in april  for  shares and was to expire march   however  all  shares were purchased by the end of the third plan was approved in december  and calls for the repurchase of up to million shares through june  in  a total of  shares had been repurchased under this third plan 
the corporation and its subsidiary banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
the regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and tier i capital to average assets as defined 
as of december   the corporation and each of its subsidiaries met the minimum capital requirements 
in addition  the corporation and each of its subsidiaries capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in the regulations 
year the corporation and its significant third party data processing service providers successfully transitioned into calendar year computer and other electronic information processing systems all properly recognized dates after  confirming the successful completion of the corporation s five step comprehensive plan year plan for awareness  assessment  renovation  validation  and implementation 
both information technology and non information technology systems  such as embedded technology in security and other systems  continue to function properly 
the corporation has not activated its established and tested contingency plans since no significant year problems have occurred 
the corporation incurred approximately million in expenses million in in completing its year plan 
the majority of these expenses were internal resources allocated to the year plan and not incremental costs 
in the future  these resources will be used for additional technology initiatives 
the corporation also incurred capital expenditures of approximately million million in to replace non compliant hardware  software and other equipment 
these expenditures  which were necessary for year  also significantly improved the overall technology infrastructure of the corporation 
other issues not related to the corporation s computer systems include the year compliance of vendors and borrowers 
the ability of vendors to continue to provide uninterrupted service and for borrowers to continue to perform on their loans could have a material impact on the corporation s financial statements 
there are no known year problems arising since the beginning of the year related to significant vendors or borrowers 
while the initial results of the corporation s year preparedness have been positive  there remains the possibility that year problems not yet identified could arise 
while management believes the likelihood of a problem relating to remaining year issues resulting in a material impact on the financial statements is remote  only the passage of time will confirm this 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments 
the types of market risk exposures generally faced by banking entities include interest rate risk  equity market price risk  foreign currency risk and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only equity market price risk and interest rate risk are significant to the corporation 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of equity investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation s equity investments consist of common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions cost basis of approximately million and us government and agency stock cost basis of approximately million 
the corporation s equity investments had a total estimated fair value of million at december  the million net unrealized gain is primarily attributable to the financial institutions stock 
although the cost basis of equity investments accounted for only of the corporation s total assets  the unrealized gains on the portfolio represent a potential source of revenue 
the corporation has a history of periodically realizing gains from this portfolio and  if values were to decline significantly  this revenue source could be lost 
the corporation manages its equity market price risk by investing only in regional financial institutions 
management continuously monitors the fair value of its equity investments and evaluates current market conditions and operating results of the companies 
periodic sale and purchase decisions are made based on this monitoring process 
none of the corporation s equity securities are classified as trading 
future cash flows from these investments are not provided here since none of them have maturity dates 
interest rate risk interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas 
first of all  changes in rates have an impact on the corporation s liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow 
secondly  movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s net income and changes in the economic value of its equity 
the corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of key financial and senior management personnel  meets on a weekly basis 
the alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation  approving asset and liability management policies  and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions and earnings 
the primary goal of asset liability management is to address the liquidity and net income risks noted above 
from a liquidity standpoint  the corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the ongoing cash flow requirements of customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
liquidity sources are found on both sides of the balance sheet 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal reductions and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments 
liquidity is also provided through the availability of deposits and borrowings 
at december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled billion or of total assets 
this compares to billion  or of total assets at december  liquidity is also provided by non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due from one to five years  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
principal payments received on the held to maturity mortgage backed securities portfolio also provide liquidity 
the corporation had million of such mortgage backed securities at december  and million at december the loan portfolio provides an additional source of liquidity due to the corporation s ability to participate in the secondary mortgage market 
sales of residential mortgages into the secondary market of million and million in and  respectively  provided the necessary funding which allowed the corporation to meet the needs of its customers for new mortgage financing 
from a funding standpoint  the corporation has been able to rely over the years on a stable base of core deposits 
even though the corporation has experienced notable changes in the composition and interest sensitivity of this deposit base  it has been able to rely on this base to provide needed liquidity 
the corporation also has access to sources of large denomination or jumbo time deposits and repurchase agreements as potential sources of liquidity 
however  the corporation has attempted to minimize its reliance upon these more volatile short term funding sources and to use them primarily to meet the requirements of its existing customer base or when it is profitable to do so 
each of the corporation s subsidiary banks are members of the fhlb  which provides them access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
at december   the corporation had million in term advances from the fhlb with an additional million of borrowing capacity including both short term funding on its lines of credit and long term borrowings 
this availability  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent commercial banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity

the preceding table and discussion addressed the liquidity implications of interest rate risk and focused on expected contractual cash flows from financial instruments 
expected contractual maturities  however  do not necessarily estimate the net income impact of interest rate changes 
certain financial instruments  such as adjustable rate loans  have repricing periods that differ from contractual cash flows 
the corporation uses three complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk 
they are static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and estimates of economic value of equity 
using these measurements in tandem provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the corporation  level of risk as time evolves  and exposure to changes in interest rate relationships 
static gap provides a measurement of repricing risk in the corporation s balance sheet as of a point in time 
this measurement is accomplished through stratification of the corporation s assets and liabilities into predetermined repricing periods 
the assets and liabilities in each of these periods are summed and compared for mismatches within that maturity segment 
core deposits having noncontractual maturities are placed into repricing periods based upon historical balance performance 
repricing for mortgage loans held and for mortgage backed securities includes the effect of expected cash flows 
estimated prepayment effects are applied to these balances based upon industry projections for prepayment speeds 
the corporation s policy limits the cumulative month gap to plus or minus of total earning assets

the following is a summary of the interest sensitivity gaps for four different time intervals as of december  daily adjustable days days days gap cumulative gap simulation of net interest income and of net income is performed for the next twelve month period 
a variety of interest rate scenarios is used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve 
these results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure the corporation s short term earnings exposure to rate movements 
the corporation s policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income to of the base case net interest income for every basis point shock in interest rates 
a shock is an immediate upward or downward movement of interest rates across the yield curve based upon changes in the prime rate 
at december  the corporation had a larger exposure to upward rate shocks  with net interest income at risk of loss over the next twelve months of  and where interest rates are shocked upward by  and basis points  respectively 
economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset cash flows and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities 
upward and downward shocks of interest rates are used to determine the comparative effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment 
this measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer term repricing risks and options in the corporation s balance sheet 
a policy limit of of economic equity may be at risk for every basis point shock movement in interest rates
