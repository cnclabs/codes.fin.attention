cost of goods sold increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in freight expenses and to electronics boutique s decision to reduce prices on selected electronic game titles in order to increase market share and sales volume 
the increase in freight expenses was the result of several factors 
electronics boutique switched its primary freight carrier and reorganized its third party distribution framework in order to improve service and merchandise availability to its stores 
there was also an increase in the overall number of units shipped by electronics boutique to its stores as a result of a lower average cost per unit of product

there will be no future equity income or loss on this investment

year readiness we met our year project objectives and completed the project prior to december  we have not experienced any disruption in our operations as a result of non compliance of vendors  financial institutions  or other third parties or external systems 
at this time  the possibility of a third party risk arising  which could have a material risk on the electronics boutique is not reasonably likely to occur

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk electronics boutique invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term investment grade securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
in addition  electronics boutique s revolving credit facility provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on either the bank s base rate or libor plus basis points 
electronics boutique had no borrowings outstanding pursuant to the revolving credit facility as of january  we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows should not be material 
electronics boutique has retail operations in various foreign countries 
electronics boutique is subject to currency exchange rate and currency devaluation risks due to these operations 
since approximately of electronics boutique s net sales are domestic  electronics boutique does not believe that currency exchange rate fluctuations would have a material adverse effect on electronics boutique s results of operations and financial condition and  accordingly  does not hedge its risk in this area 
we intend to monitor our exposure to these risks and reevaluate its hedging strategies as appropriate
