impact of the year many older computer software programs refer to years in terms of their final two digits only 
such programs may interpret the year to mean the year instead 
if not corrected  those programs could cause date related transaction failures 
we developed a compliance assurance process to address this concern 
a project team performed a detailed assessment of all internal computer systems and developed and implemented plans to correct any problems 
year problems could affect our research and development  production  distribution  financial  administrative and communication operations 
systems critical to our business which were identified as non year compliant were either replaced or corrected through programming modifications 
in addition  the project team looked at year readiness from other aspects of our business  including customer order taking  manufacturing  raw materials supply and plant process equipment 
we remediated and replaced systems as needed and have been successfully testing and verifying our modifications 
in addition to our in house efforts  we have asked vendors  major customers  service suppliers  communications providers and banks whose systems failures potentially could have a significant impact on our operations to verify their year readiness 
as part of our compliance process we developed a contingency plan for those areas that are critical to the company s business 
these plans were designed to mitigate serious disruptions to our business flow beyond the end of  and will operate independently of our external providers year compliance 
the major drive for contingency planning was in the first half of to date  we have not encountered any significant effects related to the year and we do not anticipate that any unforeseen year problems will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
external and internal costs specifically associated with modifying internal use software for year compliance were expensed as incurred 
to date  we have spent less than  on this project 
such costs do not include normal system upgrades and replacements 
the above expectations are subject to uncertainties 
for example  if we were unsuccessful in identifying or fixing all year problems in our critical operations  or if we are affected by the inability of suppliers or major customers to continue operations due to such a problem  our results of operations or financial condition could be materially impacted 
new accounting standards effective november   the company adopted sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
sfas requires companies to report all changes in equity during a period  except those resulting from investment by owners and distributions to owners  in a financial statement for the period in which they are recognized 
the company has chosen to disclose comprehensive income which encompasses net income and unrealized holding losses on investments  in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity and comprehensive income 
prior years have been reclassified to conform to the sfas requirements 
effective november   the company adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
 establishes standards for the way that public companies report selected information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those companies report selected information about segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
adoption of this statement did not impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  and any effect was limited to the form and content of its disclosures 
prior years have been reclassified to conform to the sfas requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of october   the company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest increase 
due to the short duration of these financial instruments  an immediate increase of in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial condition 
the company s outstanding debt under the revolving credit facility and industrial development revenue bonds at october  was million 
interest rates on the revolving credit facility borrowings are based on libor plus a variable margin 
interest rates on the industrial development revenue bonds are based on variable rates 
based on the outstanding balance  a change of in interest rates would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis
