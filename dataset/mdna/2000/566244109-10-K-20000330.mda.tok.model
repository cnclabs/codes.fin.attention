item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion below contains certain forward looking statements as such term is defined in section e of the securities exchange act of that are based on the beliefs of the company s management  as well as assumptions made by  and information currently available to  the company s management 
the company s results  performance and achievements in and beyond could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  any such forward looking statements 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements on page overview on march   the company merged with usweb cks 
see section entitled  subsequent event for further discussion 
as a result of the merger  the company s revenue and operating expenses will increase substantially in future periods 
the discussion that follows reports on the historical results of the company which is sometimes referred to as whittman hart 
prior to the consummation of the merger on march   the company filed a registration statement form s on january   registration no 
the filing contained unaudited pro forma information for the combined company 
the company s revenues are generated primarily from professional fees  which are generally billed at a contracted hourly rate and are recognized as services are provided 
for each of the last three fiscal years  at least of whittman hart s revenues were generated on a time and materials basis 
the company s services may also be provided on a fixed bid or fee capped basis  in which case revenues are recognized by the percentage of completion method 
these arrangements subject the company to the risk of cost overruns  however  historically  such overruns have not been significant 
the company typically bills on a weekly basis to monitor client satisfaction and manage its outstanding accounts receivable balances 
the company s most significant cost is project cost of services  which consists of consultant salaries and benefits 
thus  the company s financial performance is primarily based upon billing margin billable hourly rate less the consultant s hourly cost and personnel utilization rates billable hours divided by paid hours 
to date  the company has been able to maintain its billing margins by offsetting increases in consultant salaries with increases in its hourly rates 
because most of the company s engagements are on a time and materials basis  increases in its cost of services are generally passed along to the company s clients and  accordingly  do not have a significant impact on the company s financial results 
in addition  the company attempts to control expenses that are not passed through to its clients 
furthermore  profitability is improved by tying significant incentive compensation to achieving performance goals 
the company establishes standard billing guidelines based on the type of service offered 
actual billing rates are established on a project by project basis and may vary from the standard guidelines 
over the last three years  whittman hart s average revenue per assignment hour has steadily increased 
the growth in average revenue per assignment hour reflects a higher percentage of value added services  such as package software implementations and solutions oriented  strategic consulting projects 
the company manages its personnel utilization rates by monitoring project requirements and timetables 
the number of consultants assigned to a project will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
project terminations  completions and scheduling delays may result in periods in which consultants are not fully utilized 
an unanticipated termination of a project could result in a higher than expected number of unassigned consultants or  if the company were to terminate such consultants  increased severance expenses 
although the number of the company s consultants can be adjusted to correspond to the number of active projects  whittman hart must maintain a sufficient number of senior consultants to oversee existing client projects and assist the company s sales force in securing new client assignments 
marchfirst consultants are subject to employment contracts that may be terminated upon two weeks notice without substantial penalty or further expense to the company 
historically  whittman hart s revenue growth was attributable to the addition of new clients and the growth of current client relationships at existing and new branch locations 
during  the company continued to supplement its internal revenue growth with the acquisitions 
in  the company intends to grow its existing branch locations and expand its network through the traditional greenfield approach supplemented by acquisitions 
in addition to whittman hart s merger with usweb cks  each of the branches  originally developed by the company  has generated annual revenue and gross profit growth since inception 
on march   the company and usweb cks completed a merger 
under the terms of the merger agreement  approximately  shares of whittman hart common stock were exchanged in the merger for all the outstanding common stock of usweb cks 
in addition  employee options to purchase approximately  shares of usweb cks common stock and warrants to purchase approximately  shares of usweb cks common stock were assumed by whittman hart and became options or warrants to purchase whittman hart common stock 
these amounts reflect an exchange ratio of of a share of whitman hart common stock for each share of usweb cks common stock 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 business combinations 
the total consideration for the transaction was valued at approximately billion  which includes the value of common stock issued in the merger  options and warrants  and other direct acquisition costs

these forward looking statements are based on information currently available to marchfirst and are subject to a number of risks  uncertainties  and other factors that could cause marchfirst s actual results  performance  prospects  and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements

except as required by the federal securities law  the company does not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form k or for any other reason 
risk factors you should consider the following risks in deciding whether to invest in our company 
these matters should be considered along with the other information included in this annual report on form k 
we have separated the risks into two groups risks relating to our recently completed merger with usweb cks and risks relating to our company as it now exists following the completion of the merger 
in accordance with plain english guidelines provided by the securities and exchange commission  the risk factors have been written in the first person 
risks relating to the merger integrating whittman hart and usweb cks may be difficult 
we need to efficiently and promptly integrate operations of whittman hart and usweb cks to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger 
failure to successfully integrate the businesses of the two companies could have a negative effect on us and prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger 
certain key elements of the operations of the two companies need to be integrated  including management and other professional personnel  technical and creative service offerings  sales and marketing efforts  and financial  accounting and other operational controls  procedures  information systems and policies 
the integration process will be further complicated by the need to integrate widely dispersed operations  multiple executive offices and different corporate cultures 
this integration may not be accomplished in an efficient or effective manner  if at all 
the integration process will require the dedication of management and other personnel  which may distract their attention from the conduct of day to day business activities 
the integration of whittman hart and usweb cks will be made more difficult by the large number of other businesses recently acquired by the two companies and the continuing challenges of integrating some of these businesses 
finally  we have not attempted an acquisition with the scope or magnitude of the planned merger 
expenses associated with ongoing integration of the companies are likely to have a negative effect on our operating results at least through december  we must retain key personnel and they must work together effectively 
our success will depend upon the retention of senior executives and other key employees who are critical to the continued advancement  development and support of our services  ongoing sales and marketing efforts 
the loss of the services of any key personnel or of any significant group of employees could negatively affect our business and prospects 
as often occurs with mergers of technology services companies  our competitors may intensify their efforts to recruit key employees as we integrate the two companies 
employee uncertainty regarding the effects of the merger could also cause increased turnover 
our success largely depends on the ability of our executive officers and other members of senior management to operate effectively in their roles in the newly combined company 
if our management does not succeed in their roles or we are not able to efficiently allocate management responsibilities and cause our officers and senior managers to operate effectively as a group  our business could be negatively affected 
we could lose clients as a result of uncertainty regarding the merger 
uncertainty regarding our ability to effectively integrate the operations of the two companies without significant reduction in quality of service could lead some customers to select other vendors 
the loss of business from significant clients could have a negative effect on our business 
we must build recognition and customer acceptance of new brands 
whittman hart and usweb cks each invested significant efforts in building brand recognition and customer acceptance of our brand names 
we believe that transferring market acceptance for the whittman hart and usweb cks brands to our combined and new brands will be an important aspect of our efforts to retain and attract clients 
promoting and maintaining these brands will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide high quality  reliable and cost effective services 
these efforts will require significant expenses  which will affect our results of operations 
in addition  although we intend to centralize our marketing efforts  a significant part of our client services will continue to be provided through individual consulting offices 
client dissatisfaction with the performance of a single office could diminish the value of the combined company brands 
risks relating to our company our quarterly results may fluctuate  which may lead to reduced prices for our stock 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and our operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which will be outside of our control 
some of these factors include timing of the completion  material reduction or cancellation of major projects or the loss of a major client  the amount and timing of the receipt of new business  timing of hiring or loss of personnel  the cost and timing of the opening or closing of an office  the amount and the relative mix of high margin creative or strategy consulting projects as compared to lower margin projects  capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of operations  the level of demand for intranet  extranet and web site development  the productivity of consultants  the ability to maintain adequate staffing to service clients effectively  the cost of advertising and related media  the amount and timing of expenditures by clients for professional services  the introduction of new products or services by competitors  pricing changes in the industry  the relative mix of lower cost full time employees versus higher cost independent contractors  technical difficulties with respect to the use of the internet  economic conditions specific to internet technology usage  government regulation and legal developments regarding the use of the internet  and general economic conditions 
we may also experience seasonality in our business  resulting in diminished revenues as a consequence of decreased demand for professional services during summer and year end vacation and holiday periods 
due to all of these factors  our operating results in any given quarter may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely be significantly and negatively affected and litigation may ensue 
the historical financial data of the two companies is of limited value in planning future operating expenses 
accordingly  our expense levels will be based in part on our expectations concerning future revenues and will be fixed to a large extent 
we will be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenues 
accordingly  a significant shortfall in demand for services could have an immediate and significant negative effect on our business and results of operations 
our stock price is volatile and could decline in value 
the stock market  which has recently been at or near historic highs  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intense competition from other capital providers to acquire interests in business to business e commerce companies could result in lower returns or losses on investments 
bluevector llc  our venture capital fund  faces intense competition from traditional venture capital firms  corporate strategic investors and other capital providers to develop and acquire interests in e commerce spin off businesses 
corporate strategic investors include publicly held cmgi  internet capital group and safeguard scientifics  as well as idealab  and other private companies 
in addition  other professional services firms have recently announced their intention to provide capital and services to e commerce businesses 
many of our competitors have greater financial and management resources  brand name recognition and industry contacts than we do 
this intense competition  and the impact it has on the valuation of e commerce spin off businesses  could limit our opportunities to invest in such businesses or force us to pay higher prices for such investments  which would result in lower returns or losses on investments 
to succeed  we must recruit and retain skilled professionals  who are in short supply 
our business of delivering internet professional services is labor intensive 
accordingly  our success depends in large part on our ability to identify  hire  train and retain consulting professionals who can provide the internet strategy  technology  and marketing and creative skills required by clients 
the inability to attract and retain the necessary technical  marketing and managerial personnel would have a negative effect on our business 
there is currently a shortage of this type of personnel  and this shortage is likely to continue for the foreseeable future 
we will encounter intense competition for qualified personnel from other companies  and may not be able to identify  hire  train or retain other highly qualified technical  marketing and managerial personnel in the future 
our success depends on our ability to manage growth 
we have experienced recent rapid growth and are subject to the risks inherent in the expansion and growth of a business enterprise 
this significant growth  if sustained  will continue to place a substantial strain on our operational and administrative resources and to increase the level of responsibility for our management personnel 
to manage our growth effectively  we will need to further develop our operating  mis  accounting and financial systems and to expand  train and manage our employee base 
the management skills and systems we currently have in place may not be adequate if we continue to grow as planned 
our international operations are difficult to manage 
we have offices outside the united states 
if revenues from international consulting offices are not adequate to offset the expenses of establishing and maintaining international operations and of localizing our marketing programs  our business and results of operations could be negatively affected 
in addition to the uncertainty as to our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations and expand our international presence  there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level  including any of the following factors which could negatively affect our international operations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export and import restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  potentially adverse differences in business customs  practices and norms  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  software piracy  seasonal reductions in business activity  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the market in which we compete is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry 
the market for internet professional services is relatively new  intensely competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to intensify and increase in the future 
our competitors can be divided into several groups large information technology consulting service providers such as andersen consulting  cambridge technology partners and electronic data systems corporation  the consulting divisions of computer hardware vendors such as international business machines corporation  compaq computer corp 
and hewlett packard company  internet integrators and web presence providers such as agency 
com  ixl enterprises  inc  organic online  inc  proxicom inc  sapient corporation  scient corporation and viant corporation  and advertising and media agencies such as ogilvy mather  young rubicam  and foote  cone belding 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger installed customer bases  longer relationships with clients and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and public relations resources than we do and could decide at any time to increase their resource commitments to our target markets 
in addition  the market for intranet  extranet and web site development is relatively new and subject to continuing definition  and  as a result  may better position our competitors to compete in this market as it matures 
as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment  we may from time to time make pricing  service  technology or marketing decisions or business or technology acquisitions that could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  our ability to maintain existing client relationships and generate new clients will depend to a significant degree on the quality of our services and our reputation among clients and potential clients  as compared with our competitors 
to the extent we lose clients to our competitors because of dissatisfaction with our services or our reputation is negatively affected for any other reason  our business could be negatively affected 
there are relatively low barriers to entry into our business 
because professional services firms like us rely on the skill of their personnel and the quality of their client service  they typically have no patented technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering their markets 
we are likely to face additional competition from new entrants into the market in the future 
existing or future competitors may develop or offer services that provide significant performance  price  creative or other advantages over those offered by us  which could have a negative effect on our business and prospects 
we rely on strategic relationships that could be terminated easily 
we have a number of strategic relationships with leading hardware and software companies  including com corporation  jd edwards company  microsoft corporation  novell  inc  and siebel systems  inc 
the loss of any one of these strategic relationships would deprive us of the opportunity to gain early access to leading edge technology  cooperatively market products with the vendor  cross sell additional services and gain enhanced access to vendor training and support 
maintenance of our strategic relationships is based primarily on an ongoing mutual business opportunity and a good overall working relationship 
the legal contracts associated with these relationships would not be sufficient to force the strategic relationship to continue effectively if the strategic partner wanted to terminate the relationship 
in the event that any strategic relationship is terminated  our business may be negatively affected 
the internet economy and the market for e commerce solutions is still developing 
we expect to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from services that depend upon the adoption of internet solutions and the continued development of the world wide web  the internet and e commerce 
the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and volume of traffic 
the internet infrastructure may not continue to be able to support the demands placed on it by this continued growth 
in addition  critical issues concerning the use of internet and e commerce solutions  including security  reliability  cost  ease of deployment and administration and quality of service  remain unresolved and may affect the acceptance of these technologies to operate a business  expand product marketing  improve corporate communications and increase business efficiencies 
the adoption of internet solutions for these purposes can be capital intensive and generally requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business and exchanging information 
if critical issues concerning the ability of internet solutions to improve business positioning and processes are not resolved or if the necessary infrastructure is not developed  our business and prospects will be negatively affected 
even if these issues are resolved  businesses may not elect to outsource the design  development and maintenance of their web sites to internet professional services firms 
if independent providers of internet professional services prove to be unreliable  ineffective or too expensive  or if software companies develop tools that are sufficiently user friendly and cost effective  enterprises may choose to design  develop or maintain all or part of their intranets  extranets or web sites themselves 
if the market for such services does not continue to develop or develops more slowly than expected  or if our services do not achieve market acceptance  our business will be negatively affected 
the infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights could harm our business 
we regard our intellectual property rights  such as copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  practices and tools  as important to our success 
to protect our intellectual property rights  we rely on a combination of trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our employees  affiliates  clients  strategic partners  acquisition targets and others 
effective trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we intend to offer our services 
the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate  third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
in addition  other parties may assert infringement claims against us 
these claims  regardless of merit  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
further  an increasing number of patents are being issued to third parties regarding internet business processes 
future patents may limit our ability to use processes covered by such patents or expose us to claims of patent infringement or otherwise require us to seek to obtain related licenses 
these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms 
our failure to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms could have a negative effect on our business 
if we do not perform to our clients expectations  we face potential liability 
many of our consulting engagements involve the development  implementation and maintenance of applications that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses 
our failure or inability to meet a client s expectations in the performance of its services could injure our business reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure 
in addition  we possess technologies and content that may include confidential or proprietary client information 
although we have implemented policies to prevent this client information from being disclosed to unauthorized parties or used inappropriately  any unauthorized disclosure or use of this information could result in a claim for substantial damages 
we have attempted to contractually limit our damages arising from negligent acts  errors  mistakes or omissions in rendering professional services 
however  these contractual protections may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
although we maintain general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors and omissions  this coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or may not be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims  or the insurer may disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that are not covered by insurance or result in changes to any of our insurance policies  including premium or deductible increases or coinsurance requirements  could negatively affect our business and financial condition 
our organizational documents and current delaware law may deter potentially beneficial takeover attempts 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws and the delaware general corporation law include provisions that may be deemed to have anti takeover effects and may delay  deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
these include by law provisions under which only the chairman of the board or the president may call meetings of stockholders and certain advance notice procedures for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors 
our directors are divided into three classes and are elected to serve staggered three year terms 
our board of directors is empowered to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of these shares  without any further stockholder action 
the existence of this blank check preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of our company by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
in addition  this blank check preferred stock  and any issuance of this stock  may significantly decrease the market price of our common stock

marchfirst has a foreign currency risk related to one of our acquisitions 
our acquisitions are typically completed using our common stock as consideration for the acquisitions 
generally  at least of the shares to be issued are deposited into a one year escrow  and the remaining shares are delivered to the acquired company s shareholders 
the acquired company is valued again  typically at each of six and twelve months after the acquisition  and additional shares are issued to the acquired company s shareholders or escrowed shares are returned to marchfirst  depending on whether the valuation has increased or decreased 
some acquisitions have been completed using a cash component  typically denominated in united states dollars 
after december   the company completed one acquisition under the methodology described above  and the acquired company will be valued again in february the value of the number of shares of common stock that were issued in this transaction was denominated in swiss francs 
the value of these shares of common stock  assuming financial performance targets was met  is approximately nine million swiss francs
