accordingly  a majority of our revenues are indirectly derived from title iv programs

seasonality we experience seasonality in our quarterly results of operations as a result of changes in the level of student enrollment 
new enrollment in our schools tends to be higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters because these quarters cover periods traditionally associated with the beginning of school semesters 
costs are generally not significantly affected by the seasonal factors on a quarterly basis 
accordingly  quarterly variations in net revenues will result in fluctuations in income from operations on a quarterly basis 
impact of year in prior periods  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of our planning and implementation efforts  we did not experience significant disruptions in our computer systems or embedded systems and we believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
year costs were not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our computer systems  our embedded systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our computer systems and embedded systems throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at march   and were million  million and million  respectively 
our working capital totaled million at march   million at march  and million at march  net cash of million was provided by operating activities in fiscal and million from fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal and million from fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable  and accrued expenses 
net cash of million was used for investing activities in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal and a decrease of million from fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to our investment of million in huron university in fiscal the decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal from fiscal was due to a decrease in capital expenditures 
we estimate that the capital expenditures expected to be incurred during fiscal will approximate million 
these anticipated capital expenditures primarily relate to the costs associated with the acquisition and upgrade of equipment for the schools and the relocation and upgrade of campus facilities 
funds required to finance such capital expenditures are expected to be obtained from additional capital lease obligations and from funds generated from operations 
net cash of million was used in financing activities in fiscal  a decrease in cash used of million from fiscal year and an increase of million from fiscal the decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal from fiscal was due to a decrease in the repayment of debt 
the increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal from fiscal was due to an increase in the repayment of debt and a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants 
we have an million line of credit which was scheduled to mature on october  on may   we extended the maturity date on the line of credit to june  at march   we had million outstanding under the line of credit and letters of credit outstanding of million which reduced the amount available for borrowing 
the amounts borrowed under this facility in fiscal were primarily used for operations and capital expenditures 
on november   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
we anticipate that the repurchase of shares will be funded through cash from operations 
as of june   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately  our primary source of operating liquidity is the cash received from payments of tuition and fees 
most students attending our schools receive some form of financial aid under title iv programs 
uds  sanford brown and colorado tech receive approximately  and of their funding  respectively  from the title iv programs 
disbursements under each program are subject to disallowance and repayment by the schools 
we believe that given our working capital  our cash flow from operations  our line of credit and our expected increased financings under capital lease obligations to fund capital expenditures  we will have adequate resources to meet our anticipated operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
we will begin following the guidance provided by sab effective april  we anticipate that sab will result in the deferral of our recognition of certain types of revenues and will require a one time  cumulative adjustment that will reduce our after tax earnings by approximately  in the first quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
we are subject to interest rate risk related to our variable rate line of credit as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at march   our variable rate long term debt had a carrying value of million 
the fair value of the debt approximates the carrying value because the variable rates approximate market rates 
a increase in the period end interest rate would not have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition
