item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations paul son provides gaming equipment and supplies to new casinos and consumable products to its existing customer base 
the principal consumable products have limited useful lives  ranging from several hours in the case of playing cards and dice to several months in the case of table game layouts and several years in the case of casino chips and gaming furniture 
the majority of the company s revenues are generated by sales to customers with which the company has an established relationship 
complementing these revenues is the significant additional revenue the company realizes when providing a full range of products to new casinos 
the company strives to become the casino s sole supplier of table game equipment and supplies 
during the past decade  casino entities have expanded from land based resort properties to riverboats  both cruising and dockside  and to native american lands 
as a licensed supplier  the company has vigorously pursued table gaming opportunities in emerging gaming jurisdictions 
because of the company s production capacity and its experience in the gaming supply industry  management believes the company is well positioned to capitalize on the combined growth of the gaming industry both domestically and internationally 
while the gaming industry has grown in recent years  the growth rate of table games has not matched that of the gaming industry as a whole 
this trend is attributed to an increasing allocation of total casino gaming space to slot machines which  in certain cases  may reduce the allocation of total casino gaming space to table games 
the number of new table games in new jurisdictions typically follows this trend after a period of operation 
results of operations the following table summarizes selected items from the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated fiscal years ended may  revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss interest expense net loss the following table details the company s historical revenues by product line fiscal years ended may  in thousands revenues casino chips table layouts fiscal years ended may  in thousands playing cards gaming furniture dice table accessories and other products total comparison of operations for the fiscal years ended may  and may  revenues 
for the fiscal year ended may   paul son s revenues totaled approximately million 
the fiscal revenues represent a million  or  decrease from the million in revenues which the company generated during the previous fiscal year 
the decrease in revenues for the fiscal period resulted principally from a decrease in gaming furniture and playing card sales of approximately million  offset  in part  by an increase in casino chip and dice sales of approximately million 
gaming furniture sales  which are comprised principally of gaming tables and related seating products  declined in fiscal due to decreased casino expansions  new openings and non recurring one time orders for such products 
additionally  playing card sales declined primarily due to competitive pressures which caused a decrease in the average selling price of playing cards versus the prior fiscal year 
offsetting these revenue decreases were increases in casino chips sales from increased demand for commemorative casino chips during the year casino celebrations as well as certain significant chip replacement orders 
although management believes demand for commemorative casino chips will continue to be strong  it does not anticipate the volume of commemorative casino chips sales for the upcoming new year celebrations to be as significant compared to the year commemorative chip sales volume 
sales of company manufactured products were approximately of total revenues in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal cost of revenues 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of sales  decreased to for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
this improvement in the gross margin percentage during fiscal was principally caused by the aforementioned increase in sales of products manufactured by the company  which generally produce larger margins than products distributed by the company 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended may  decreased approximately  or  to approximately million  or of revenues  compared to approximately million  or of revenues  in the previous fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in administrative and sales department personnel related costs and the closure  in fiscal  of certain of the company s retail and outlying sales offices 
interest expense 
for the year ended may   interest expense increased approximately to approximately  as compared to approximately  in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was caused by the full year impact  in fiscal  of an approximately  capital lease entered into in march  offset  in part  by the absence of line of credit borrowings in fiscal versus fiscal other income 
in fiscal  other income decreased to approximately  compared to other income in fiscal of approximately  this decline of approximately  was primarily attributable to the gain on the sale of certain company owned real estate of approximately  in fiscal offset  in part  by the gain on the sale of certain non operating assets of approximately  in fiscal income taxes 
in fiscal  the company recorded a tax provision of  compared to recording a tax benefit in fiscal of  the company recorded the fiscal tax provision due to present uncertainties related to the realizability of future tax benefits that were recorded as deferred tax assets in fiscal and net loss 
for the year ended may   the company incurred a net loss of approximately  versus a net loss of approximately  in the prior fiscal year 
this decline of approximately  was primarily due to the aforementioned decreases in revenues  other income and the increased tax provision offset  in part  by the aforementioned improvements in gross profit and sg a expenses as compared to fiscal basic and diluted net loss per share was 
for the year ended may  as compared with basic and diluted net loss of 
for the year ended may  comparison of operations for the fiscal years ended may  and may  revenues 
for the fiscal year ended may   paul son s revenues totaled approximately million 
the fiscal revenue figure represents a million  or  decrease from the million in revenues which the company generated during the previous fiscal year 
the decrease in revenues for the period resulted principally from a decrease in gaming furniture and accessory sales products not manufactured by the company of approximately million offset  in part  by an increase in playing card sales of approximately million  an increase in casino chip sales of approximately 
million and increases in both layout and dice sales of 
million each 
gaming furniture and accessory sales  which are products purchased from third party suppliers and then sold to the customer  decreased principally due to the absence of significant orders from certain customers associated with new openings and expansions which occurred in the previous fiscal year 
partially offsetting the decrease in gaming furniture and accessory sales was an increase in playing card sales in fiscal of approximately from fiscal management believes its ability to meet customers quality expectations  competitive pricing  and its pursuit of new card contracts contributed to this growth 
sales of company manufactured products were approximately of total revenues in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal cost of revenues 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of sales  decreased to for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
this improvement in gross margins was principally caused by two significant factors i the aforementioned change in the mix of products sold from marginally profitable distributed items in fiscal  such as gaming tables and seating furniture  to higher margin  company manufactured products casino chips  cards  dice and layouts in fiscal and ii the absence of certain cost inefficiencies in fiscal resulting from the final transition of certain manufacturing processes ie playing cards  layouts  and certain plastic goods from the company s las vegas facility to its mexico facilities which occurred in late fiscal during certain previous reporting periods  the company had experienced a positive impact from the decrease in the value of the mexican peso 
during the fiscal year ended may   the value of the mexican peso versus the us dollar again declined  however  the decline was not significant and thus did not significantly impact the overall margins of the company 
the company cannot predict what impact fluctuations between the mexican peso and the us dollar will have on the future operating results of the company 
gross profit 
gross profit increased in absolute dollars by approximately million to approximately million as compared to approximately million in the prior fiscal year 
this improvement in gross profit was a result of the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of sales from to due to the cost of revenue factors discussed above offset  in part  by decreased revenues in the fiscal period 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended may  decreased approximately  or  to approximately million or of revenues compared to approximately million  or of revenues  in the previous fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in payroll related expenses  a decrease in provisions for bad debts caused by lower sales volume in the current year and certain recoveries of previously written off bad debts 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in depreciation expense  costs associated with the formation of the company s non gaming business operations and increased licensing and regulatory investigative costs caused by the continued worldwide proliferation of gaming 
interest expense 
for the year ended may   interest expense increased approximately to  as compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was caused by i increased average outstanding borrowings under the company s line of credit during fiscal  ii the acquisition of a  note in october  to finance additional playing card equipment  and iii the full year impact  in fiscal  of million of certain debt acquired to finance a new building and certain equipment in san luis  mexico in november other income 
in fiscal  other income increased to approximately  or  over the previous fiscal year 
this increase was attributable principally to a gain before income taxes of approximately  which resulted from the sale of certain real estate in fiscal net loss 
for the year ended may   the company incurred a net loss of approximately  an improvement of approximately million from the net loss of approximately million in the prior fiscal year 
this improvement was primarily due to the aforementioned increases in gross profit  other income  and decreases to sg a expenses from the period  offset  in part  by the decrease in revenues from the prior fiscal year

working capital 
working capital totaled approximately million at may   versus approximately million at may  working capital decreased approximately million during the year primarily due to the increase in current maturities of long term debt of approximately million 
the current maturities of long term debt increased due to a june  forbearance agreement entered into with a bank which accelerates principal payments of outstanding debt obligations during the fiscal year ending may  see secured debt 
decreases in accounts receivable and inventories were offset by an increase in cash and decreases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and customer deposits

the company is required to comply with the provisions of sab by the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ending may  due to the nature of the company s operations  management does not believe that sab will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
statement on forward looking information certain information included herein contains statements that may be considered forward looking  such as statements relating to anticipated performance  financing sources and the relocation of certain operations 
any forward looking statement made by the company necessarily is based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that  while considered reasonable by the company  is inherently subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the control of the company  and are subject to change 
actual results of the company s operations may vary materially from any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
forward looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the forward looking statements will be achieved 
undue reliance should not be placed on any forward looking statements 
some of the contingencies and uncertainties to which any forward looking statement contained herein is subject include  but are not limited to  the following reliance on expansion of casino industry 
nearly all of the company s revenue is generated by sales relating to existing casinos  casino openings and expansions 
although the company is pursuing opportunities to sell and market its products to industries outside of the casino industry  the company s future growth may be dependent on the continued emergence and growth of new markets for the company s products  including new casino openings or expansions throughout the united states and other areas of the world 
a reduction in the pace of new casino openings and casino expansions in existing and emerging legalized gaming jurisdictions would have a negative effect on the company s business 
similarly  the restriction or abolishment of legalized casino gaming in jurisdictions in which the company currently does business would have a negative impact on the company 
gaming regulations 
the manufacture and distribution of gaming equipment and supplies are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation 
although these regulations vary among jurisdictions  virtually all jurisdictions require licenses  permits and approvals to be held by the company and its key personnel in connection with the manufacture and distribution of some or all of the company s products 
the failure of the company or its key personnel to obtain or retain required licenses  permits or approvals in one or more jurisdictions could have an adverse effect on the company and could adversely affect the ability of the company and its key personnel to obtain or retain licenses in other jurisdictions 
no assurance can be given that such licenses  permits or approvals will be obtained  retained or renewed in the future in existing or emerging jurisdictions 
the regulatory environment in which the company operates requires  among other things  that the company develop and follow certain internal due diligence procedures to ensure its gaming regulatory licenses are not jeopardized relative to its business operations and customer base 
as such  the company may require information from  and perform inquiries into  potential customers above what certain competitors may require depending on the extent of the competitors internal procedural requirements or the absence of such 
to the extent potential customers are adverse to these procedures  the company may be at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors 
any beneficial holder of the company s common stock may be subject to investigation by the gaming authorities in any or all of the jurisdictions in which the company operates if such authorities have reason to believe that such ownership may be inconsistent with such state s gaming policies 
persons who acquire beneficial ownership of more than certain designated percentages of common stock will be subject to certain reporting and qualification procedures established by the nevada and other gaming authorities  as well as certain local licensing authorities 
need for tribal state compacts 
the company s ability to generate greater revenues and earnings is dependent in part on the growth of native american tribal casinos 
under igra  the operation of a casino on native american tribal land is not permitted until the native american tribe and the state in which it is located have entered into a tribal state compact authorizing gaming on the tribe s land and such tribal state compact is approved by the secretary of the department of interior 
many states have resisted entering into tribal state compacts  which has resulted in litigation challenging the constitutionality of igra 
if igra were found to be unconstitutional  the procedures that would apply to the initiation and operation of native american tribal casinos would be uncertain 
such a finding could severely limit or delay the expansion of gaming in additional jurisdictions 
in addition  a recent court ruling has placed limits on the ability of native american tribes to force states to enter into tribal state compacts and several states  through legislation or constitutional amendment  have sought to limit the scope of native american gaming under igra 
variability of quarterly operating results 
the company s financial results are dependent in part upon sales to new or expanding casinos  which may  in turn  be dependent upon the authorization of gaming in additional jurisdictions 
the timing of these events does not follow consistent patterns throughout any given year 
given this uncertain timing and the large dollar value of sales to new casinos  the company s future operating results may be subject to significant quarterly fluctuations 
table games growth rate 
the company s primary products are sold to casinos with table games 
in recent years  there has been an increasing allocation of total casino gaming space to slot machines  and in certain cases  a resulting reduction in the allocation of total casino gaming space to table games 
as a result  the growth rate of table games has not matched that of the casino industry as a whole 
although the company s recurring product sales have grown marginally over the past several years  the company believes that the company s rate of growth would have been greater if not for this trend 
an acceleration of the aforementioned trend of allocating more gaming space to slot machines rather than table games could have a negative impact on the company s rate of growth 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant degree on the performance of eric p 
endy  chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
the company carries key man life insurance on eric p 
endy  and the loss of the services of him could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is also dependent upon the abilities and efforts of certain other management personnel 
management anticipates that as the company continues to expand into new gaming jurisdictions throughout the united states and internationally  its future success will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to fill key sales  administrative and management positions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to locate and retain such individuals 
foreign currency 
the majority of the company s employees are located in mexico and are paid in mexican pesos 
to the extent that inflationary costs of the company s mexican operation is not offset by a devaluation of the mexican peso versus the us dollar  the company could experience a material adverse financial impact 
expansion of international sales 
although currently only a small percentage of the company s sales are to casinos located in foreign countries  a component of the company s business strategy is the expansion of its international sales 
to the extent the company is successful in this endeavor  it will be increasingly subject to the customary risks of doing business in foreign countries 
these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls  competitive issues relative to established businesses with significant current market share and business customer relationships  nationalization and other economic  tax and regulatory policies of local governments and the possibility of trade embargoes  political instability or war or other hostility  as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 
competition 
there are significant competitors in each of the company s major product lines 
with the continuing expansion of gaming  it is possible that new competitors may be attracted to the table game supply business  some of which may be in the business of selling gaming products  have licenses to sell gaming supplies and have greater financial resources than the company 
the entry by such companies into the company s markets could adversely impact the company s business 
control by existing stockholder  anti takeover effects 
eric p 
endy is the beneficial owner of approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company 
as a result  mr 
endy effectively controls the election of all of the members of the board of directors of the company and effectively controls virtually all matters requiring approval by the stockholders of the company 
such ownership may discourage acquisition of large blocks of the company s securities and could have an anti takeover effect  possibly depressing the price of the common stock 
in addition  nevada corporation law and the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
reliance on suppliers 
for certain of its products  the company is dependent upon a limited number of suppliers to provide the company with raw materials for manufacturing and finished goods for distribution 
the failure of one or more of these suppliers to meet the company s performance specifications  quality standards or delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company has certain fixed rate debt and a variable rate capital lease which it believes to have fair values that approximate reported amounts 
the company believes that any market risk arising from these financial instruments is not material
