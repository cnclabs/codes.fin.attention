the largest south pacific subsidiary operations are in the french territories of french polynesia and new caledonia 
the west pacific division includes bank of hawaii branches in guam and in other locations in the region

based on these analyses  credit limits are established for each country to control risk in the foreign portfolio 
these credit limits are monitored and reviewed on a regular basis so that risks and exposures are understood and properly assessed 
pacific century s strategy for foreign lending is to deal  on a direct basis  primarily with countries and companies that have trade activity in the asia pacific region and investment interest in hawaii and the west and south pacific 
pacific century s foreign lending consists of both local currency and cross border lending 
local currency loans are those that are funded and will be repaid in the currency of the borrower s country 
cross border lending  on the other hand  involves loans that will be repaid in a currency other than that of the borrower s country 
this type of lending involves greater risk because the borrower s ability to repay is additionally dependent on changes in the currency exchange rate 
cross border interbank placements and loans were million at year end table presents  for the last three years  a geographic distribution of international assets for which pacific century has cross border exposure exceeding of total assets 
the countries to which pacific century maintains its largest credit exposure on a cross border basis include japan  south korea  and france 
at december   cross border credit exposure in japan  south korea  and france were million  million and million  respectively  compared to million  million and million  respectively  at december  the rise in cross border exposure to france resulted from an increase in interbank placements with french banks 
beginning in mid  a number of countries in asia experienced financial difficulties that included significant devaluation of their currency  higher interest rates and general tightening of credit 
in view of the risks  pacific century increased its provision for loan losses in by the end of  the economies and financial environment in most asian countries had improved in terms of currency exchange rate stability  interest rates and gross domestic product growth 
however  in spite of the improving economic trend  the impact of government and corporate restructuring in the region is still being felt 
for pacific century the impact was greatest in south korea 
while south korea has made tremendous strides in improving its economy and financial markets  certain korean corporations have had difficulties in adjusting to mandated and advisable reforms 
the most notable impact to pacific century was million in exposure to a south korean conglomerate of which million was outstanding 
during the third quarter of  the borrower suspended debt service payments and began negotiations with its domestic and foreign bank creditors 
at the end of  those negotiations had not produced a definitive resolution of the matter with foreign lenders 
consequently  pacific century charged off credits of million and placed million on non performing status 
negotiations with the conglomerate and its creditors are in process

in order to minimize credit losses  pacific century strives to maintain high underwriting standards  identify potential problem loans early and work with borrowers to cure delinquencies 
moreover  charge offs  if required  are taken promptly and reserve levels are maintained at adequate levels 
pacific century s policy is to place loans on non accrual status when a loan is over days delinquent  unless collection is likely based on specific factors such as the type of borrowing agreement and or collateral 
at the time a loan is placed on non accrual  all accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current earnings 
total non accrual loans rose to million at year end  up over year end higher non accrual balances in the foreign and commercial real estate categories accounted for this increase 
non accrual loans in the c i and residential real estate portfolios reflected a decline from year end at december   foreign loans on non accrual were million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase partially results from placing million of loans to a south korean conglomerate on non accrual status 
total non accrual loans in asia rose to million at december   from million at december  additional information relative to asian exposure is contained in foreign operations 
c i loans classified as non accrual totaled million at year end  compared to million and million at year end and  respectively 
at december   non accrual loans secured by real estate totaled million  or of total non accrual loans 
commercial real estate loans on non accrual status were million at december   up from million at the end of this increase is mainly due to the transfer of several large hawaii based commercial real estate loans to non accrual in the first quarter of non performing residential mortgages excluding construction loans totaled million at year end  compared to million at year end  reflecting a year over year decline of million 
because residential mortgages are secured by real estate  the credit risk on these loans are lower than unsecured lending 
most of the company s residential loans are owner occupied first mortgages and were generally underwritten to provide a loan to value ratio of no more than at origination 
additionally  the risk in this portfolio is also moderated by the smaller average loan balance compared to commercial lending 
foreclosed real estate declined to million at year end  from million at year end at december   the foreclosed real estate portfolio consisted of properties  mostly located in hawaii 
the largest property represented of the total

the reserve level is determined based on a continuing assessment of problem credits  recent loss experience  changes in collateral values  and current and anticipated economic conditions 
pacific century s credit administration procedures emphasizes the early recognition and monitoring of problem loans in order to control delinquencies and minimize losses 
for loans other than consumer loans  a line driven risk rating system is used 
loans are graded based on the degree of risk at origination by the lending officer and thereafter  are reviewed periodically as appropriate 
an independent evaluation of this process is performed by the credit review department to ensure compliance of the risk grades and timeliness of grade changes 
pacific century performs a comprehensive quarterly analysis to determine the adequacy of its reserve for loan losses 
this analysis incorporates risk migration modeling and transfer risk 
pacific century utilizes a methodology that establishes both specific and general reserves 
commercial loans and leases are individually reviewed according to specified criteria to determine specific loss exposure 
loans for which a specific reserve allocation is not established are placed in loan pools for purposes of determining the general reserve allocation 
at pacific century  general reserve allocations for various loan pools are determined based on a risk migration analysis component and a subjective factors component 
the migration model determines potential loss factors based on historical loss experience for homogeneous loan portfolios and based on risk grades for risk rated portfolios 
the subjective factors component includes an evaluation of the changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  delinquency and non accrual trends  lending policies and procedures  and other relevant general factors 
for foreign credits  general reserves are further stratified to address transfer risk 
general reserve allocations for transfer risk are determined based on the type of credit facility and internal country risk ratings

the increase in gross charge offs in is partly attributed to a rise in the foreign category to million from million in of this amount  million is associated with charge offs pertaining to a south korean conglomerate

the lower reserve allocation in the c i portfolio is partially attributed to a decline in non performing c i loans 
lower reserves allocated to the installment category is due to improvements in the risk characteristics of this portfolio that reflects both a decline in delinquencies and charge offs

pacific century s asset and liability management process involves measuring  monitoring  controlling and managing financial risks that can significantly impact the company s financial position and operating results 
financial risks in the form of interest rate sensitivity  foreign exchange fluctuations  liquidity exposure  and capital adequacy are balanced with expected returns to maximize earnings performance and shareholder value  while limiting the volatility of each 
the activities associated with these financial risks are categorized into other than trading or trading 
other than trading activities in the normal course of business  elements of pacific century s balance sheet are exposed to varying degrees of market risk 
market risk arises from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
a key element in the process of managing market risk involves oversight by the board of directors and senior management as to the level of such risk assumed by pacific century in its balance sheet 
the board reviews and approves risk management policies  including risk limits and guidelines and delegates to the asset liability management committee alco oversight functions 
the alco  consisting of the managing committee and senior business and finance officers  monitors pacific century s market risk exposure and as market conditions dictate  modifies balance sheet positions or directs the use of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk 
pacific century s balance sheet is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from pacific century s normal business activities of making loans and taking deposits 
many other factors also affect pacific century s exposure to changes in interest rates 
these factors include general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  and historical pricing spread relationships 
a key element in pacific century s ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of a net interest income nii simulation model 
this model is used to estimate the amount that nii will change over a one year time horizon under various interest rate scenarios 
these estimates are based on numerous assumptions that include loan and deposit volumes and pricing  prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets  and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments 
while such assumptions are inherently uncertain  management believes that these assumptions are reasonable 
as a result  the nii simulation model provides a sophisticated estimate rather than a precise prediction of nii s exposure to higher or lower interest rates 
table presents as of december   and  the estimate of the change in nii from a gradual basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  moving in parallel fashion for the entire yield curve  over the next month period relative to what the nii would have been if interest rates did not change 
the resulting estimate in nii exposure is well within the approved alco guidelines and presents a balance sheet exposure that is slightly liability sensitive 
a liability sensitive exposure would imply an unfavorable short term impact on nii in periods of rising interest rates 
market risk exposure to interest rate changes table december interest rate interest rate interest rate change change change in basis points in basis points in basis points estimated exposure as a percent of net interest income to enhance and complement the results from the nii simulation model  pacific century also reviews other measures of interest rate risk 
these measures include the sensitivity of market value of equity and the exposure to basis risk and non parallel yield curve shifts 
there are inherent limitations to these measures but used along with the nii simulation model  pacific century gets a better overall insight for managing its exposure to changes in interest rates 
in managing interest rate risks  pacific century uses several approaches  both on and off balance sheet  to modify its risk position 
approaches that are used to shift balance sheet mix or alter the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities include changing product pricing strategies  modifying investment portfolio strategies  or using financial derivatives 
the use of financial derivatives  as detailed in note o to the consolidated financial statements  has been limited over the past several years 
during this period  pacific century has relied more on the use of on balance sheet alternatives to manage its interest rate risk position 
foreign currency risk 
pacific century s broad area of operations throughout the south pacific and asia has the potential to expose the company to foreign currency risk 
in general  however  most foreign currency denominated assets are funded by like currency liabilities  with imbalances corrected through the use of various hedge instruments as disclosed in note o to the consolidated financial statements 
by policy  the net exposure in those balance sheet activities described above is insignificant 
on the other hand  pacific century is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate changes from the capital invested in its foreign subsidiaries and branches located throughout the south pacific and asian rim 
these investments are designed to diversify pacific century s total balance sheet exposure 
while a portion of the capital investment in french polynesia and new caledonia is offset by a borrowing denominated in euro or foreign exchange currency hedge transactions  the remainder of these capital positions  aggregating million at december   is not hedged 
pacific century uses a value at risk var calculation to measure the potential loss from foreign currency exposure 
pacific century s var is calculated at a confidence interval and assumes a normal distribution 
pacific century utilizes the variance covariance approach to estimate the probability of future changes in foreign exchange rates 
under this approach  equally weighted daily closing prices are used to determine the daily volatility for the last    and days 
pacific century uses the highest daily volatility of the four trading periods in its var calculation 
to estimate the potential loss in its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and branches  pacific century takes the daily volatility and annualizes it by multiplying by the number of trading days in a year 
therefore  the var determines the potential one year loss within a confidence interval of the net investment in subsidiaries 
in other words  a loss greater than var has approximately a probability of occurring

trading activities pacific century s trading activities include foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts that expose pacific century to a minor degree of foreign currency risk 
these transactions are executed on behalf of customers and for the company s own account 
pacific century  however  manages its trading account such that it does not maintain significant foreign currency open positions 
to measure the exposure of these open positions  pacific century uses the var methodology described above 
the var measurement for trading activities as of year end continues to be immaterial 
liquidity management liquidity is managed to ensure that pacific century has continuous access to sufficient  reasonably priced funding to conduct its business in a normal manner 
pacific century s alco monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change 
this process combined with pacific century s ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk 
to ensure that its liquidity needs are met  pacific century actively manages both the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet 
the primary sources of liquidity on the asset side of the balance sheet are available for sale investment securities  interest bearing deposits  and cash flows from loans and investments  as well as the ability to securitize certain assets 
with respect to liabilities  liquidity is generated through growth in deposits and the ability to obtain wholesale funding in national and local markets through a variety of sources 
pacific century obtains short term wholesale funding through federal funds purchased  repos  and commercial paper 
pacific century issues commercial paper in various denominations with maturities of generally days or less 
during  pacific century issued commercial paper only in the hawaii marketplace 
repos are financing transactions  whereby securities are pledged as collateral for short term borrowings 
nearly all of pacific century s repos consist of transactions with governmental entities 
pacific century s balance sheet is unique given the high level of state and local government funding 
historically  these governmental entities have provided a stable source of funds 
pacific century maintained a million  annually renewable line of credit for working capital purposes 
fees are paid on the unused balance of the line

bank of hawaii and first savings are both members of the federal home loan bank of seattle 
the fhlb provides these institutions with an additional source for short and long term funding 
additionally  bank of hawaii maintains a billion senior and subordinated bank note program 
under this facility  bank of hawaii may issue additional notes provided that at any time the aggregate amount outstanding does not exceed billion 
at december   there was million outstanding under this program represented by the issuance of subordinated notes in capital management pacific century manages its capital level to optimize shareholder value  support asset growth  reflect risks inherent in its markets  provide protection against unforeseen losses and comply with regulatory requirements 
capital levels are reviewed periodically relative to pacific century s risk profile and current and projected economic conditions 
pacific century s objective is to hold sufficient capital on a regulatory basis to exceed the minimum guidelines of a well capitalized institution 
at year end  pacific century s shareholders equity grew to billion  an increase of over year end the source of growth in shareholders equity in included retention of earnings and issuance of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan and various stock based employee benefit plans 
offsetting these increases were cash dividends paid of million and treasury stock purchases of million and unrealized valuation adjustments of million 
pacific century s regulatory capital ratios at year end were tier capital ratio of  total capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of 
all three capital ratios exceeded the federal bank regulators minimum threshold levels for an institution to qualify as well capitalized 
the regulatory standards for well capitalized are as follows tier capital  total capital  and the leverage ratio 
these standards represent minimum guidelines and pacific century manages its capital base in accordance with the attributes noted at the beginning of this section 
table presents a five year history of activities and balances in pacific century s capital accounts along with key capital ratios 
as of december   million of capital securities that mature in were outstanding 
these securities qualify as tier i capital for regulatory accounting purposes  but are classified as long term debt in the statement of condition 
in addition  pacific century had subordinated debt of million at the end of that qualified as total capital for regulatory purposes 
over the past few years  pacific century has repurchased shares under various stock repurchase programs in order to maintain its capital position at a desired level 
in  pacific century s board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of during s fourth quarter  pacific century repurchased approximately  shares under this program

diluted earnings per share were and in the same respective periods 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis totaled million in the fourth quarter of  almost level with the same period in the net interest margin in s fourth quarter was  compared to in the fourth quarter of this improvement primarily was driven by a basis points drop in the average rate on interest bearing liabilities for the quarter from the same year earlier period 
additionally a basis points rise in the average yield on earning assets in s fourth quarter relative to the same period last year also contributed to the wider net interest margin 
in the fourth quarter of  provision for loan losses was million  up from million in the same year ago quarter 
the current quarter loan loss provision was less than net charge offs of million  that included charge offs of million relative to a south korean conglomerate 
certain asian borrowers have continued to experience difficulties arising from the financial volatility in asia 
in  pacific century increased its reserve for loan losses primarily through a second quarter provision of million as a result of its evaluation of the inherent risk associated with the asian economic crisis 
non interest income in the final quarter of increased to million from million in s comparable period 
during the current quarter the disposition of two venture capital related assets contributed million to other income and million to investment securities gains 
non interest expense totaled million  relatively unchanged from s fourth quarter and million less than reported in s third quarter  exclusive of the restructuring charge 
large non recurring items that impacted fourth quarter non interest expense included a million reduction in accruals for deferred compensation and post retirement medical benefits  and approximately million in increased one time costs for various other operating expense items
