see special note regarding forward looking statements above for additional factors relating to such statements 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
general the company was organized under the laws of the state of texas on february  pursuant to the reorganization of the company in preparation for the initial public offering  the shareholders of the prior corporations contributed to the company all outstanding shares of capital stock of each corporation  and the company issued to such shareholders in exchange therefor an aggregate of  shares of its common stock 
the exchange transaction was completed april   and  as a result  the corporations became wholly owned subsidiaries of the company  and each shareholder of the company received a number of shares of common stock in the company 
the company s primary source of revenues is the sale of food and beverages at company owned restaurants 
the company also derives revenues from franchise fees  royalties and other franchise related activities 
under the terms of the company s current franchise agreement  franchisees are generally required to pay a franchise fee of  per restaurant and royalty fees of up to of gross sales 
the royalty fees vary from franchise to franchise 
area developers franchisees who plan to develop more that one restaurant will be required to pay an initial development fee equal to the total initial franchise fee for the first franchise agreement to be executed pursuant to the development schedule specified in the agreement  plus of the initial franchise fee payable for each additional franchise agreement 
the development fee will be non refundable  but will be applied proportionately to the franchise fees associated with additional restaurants 
new area developers will be required to pay monthly royalties for all restaurants developed pursuant to such franchise agreements on a declining scale ranging from to of gross sales 
franchise fee revenue from an individual franchise sale is recognized when all services relating to the sale have been performed and the restaurant has commenced operation 
initial franchise fees relating to area franchise sales are recognized ratably in proportion to services that are required to be performed pursuant to the area franchise or development agreements and proportionately as the restaurants within the area are opened 
prior to the company s initial public offering in april  a significant portion of the company s operating expenses was attributable to the compensation of larry n 
forehand and michael d 
domec  the original principals of the company  and payment of compensation and fees to certain of their respective affiliates 
subsequent to the offering  mr 
domec has continued to serve as a director of the company  but is no longer an employee and has instead focused on development of additional casa ole restaurants in his capacity as a franchisee 
in fiscal  mr 
forehand became director of franchise services and remains as a member of the board of directors 
in addition  certain transactions and compensation arrangements between the company and affiliates of messrs 
forehand and domec were terminated subsequent to the offering 
the company has employment agreements with each of louis p 
neeb  curt glowacki and andrew dennard 
the pro forma effect of the elimination of mr 
domec s compensation and payments to certain entities related to messrs 
domec and forehand  the reduction in mr 
forehand s compensation and the compensation arrangements for the new executive officers is reflected in the financial statements and supplementary data consolidated statements of income found elsewhere in this report 
concurrent with the initial public offering and the reorganization  the company terminated the s corporation status of the prior corporations that had elected to be taxed as s corporations under the code  and such corporations became taxable as c corporations  adopting the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
accordingly  a pro forma provision for federal and state income taxes  using a combined effective rate  is presented for fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  as if the company was taxed in its entirety as a c corporation 
income taxes for the restaurants originally structured as c corporations have historically been calculated in accordance with sfas fiscal year the company has a week fiscal year ending on a sunday nearest december references in this report to fiscal  and relate to the periods ended december   january  and january   respectively 
fiscal years and presented herein consisted of weeks 
fiscal year consisted of weeks 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
fiscal revenues increased million or to million 
restaurant sales increased million or to million 
la senorita  which was acquired on april   contributed million in restaurant sales 
five new restaurants were opened  one restaurant was reopened  and two restaurant were closed leases expired during the year 
total system same store sales including la senorita were down 
company owned same store sales were down and franchise owned same store sales were up 
due to new store development of higher volume tortuga coastal cantina and la senorita restaurants  company owned average weekly sales increased 
franchise fees and royalties increased or  to million 
two franchise restaurants were closed one of which was acquired by the company and converted into a tortuga coastal cantina  one franchise restaurant was opened and four franchise restaurants were acquired through the la senorita acquisition 
costs and expenses 
costs of sales  consisting of food  beverage  liquor  supplies and paper costs  increased basis points to compared with in fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher costs of sales associated with new store development  the acquisition of la senorita and the non core stores located in idaho and tennessee 
cheese prices were also higher during fiscal year labor and other related expenses increased basis points to compared with in fiscal again  the increase was primarily due to higher labor costs associated with new store development  the acquisition of la senorita and the non core stores located in idaho and tennessee 
restaurant operating expenses increased basis points to compared with in fiscal the increase was primarily due to last year s million sale and leaseback transaction closed on june  which increased rent expense 
general and administrative expenses g a decreased basis points to compared with in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to the absorption of general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base 
fiscal year included  in write offs of site development costs and fiscal year included a  recovery of a previously taken special charge 
depreciation and amortization increased basis points to compared with in fiscal this increase is primarily due to the la senorita acquisition 
further  five new restaurants were opened and nine restaurants were remodeled 
pre opening costs decreased basis points to compared with in fiscal the prior year was impacted by the adoption of aicpa statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop  which requires that costs of start up activities be expensed as incurred 
during fiscal year  the company evaluated certain properties and restaurants to determine if continued operation was consistent with the company s strategy 
as a result of this exercise  it was determined that certain assets were impaired and the company expensed million related to restaurant closure and asset impairment costs 
infrequently occurring income and expense consisted of two items that increased operating income in the aggregate by  the company sold one restaurant to the state of texas by eminent domain for  resulting in a gain of  as part of the company s decision to consolidate with a single outsourcing firm its accounting process  the company settled its old outsourcing contract for  other income expense 
net other expense increased basis points to compared with in fiscal income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was compared with in fiscal the higher rate is due to the effect of permanent tax differences on lower income before taxes 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
fiscal revenues increased million or to million 
restaurant sales increased million or to million  reflecting the full year results of mac 
on a comparable basis  total system sales at restaurants operating in both fiscal years same stores were up 
franchise owned same stores sales were up 
company owned same store sales were up 
restaurant sales were adversely impacted by the opening and operation of a texas casa ole franchise restaurant by a director and franchisee of the company 
fiscal sales at two nearby company owned stores decreased by approximately  from fiscal the company estimates that the company s after tax net income was reduced by  after offsetting franchise income or on a per share basis 
franchise fees and royalties increased despite two fewer franchise restaurants compared with fiscal the increase was attributable to greater same store sales 
costs and expenses 
costs of sales  consisting of food  beverage  liquor  supplies and paper costs  increased basis points to compared with in fiscal the increase is attributable in part to an increase in the proportion of mac restaurants  which have a higher average cost of sales than the casa ole restaurants 
also contributing to the increase is the new emphasis placed on value perception within the casa ole concept  achieved primarily by increasing portion sizes 
and finally  the cost of cheese and poultry impacted food cost approximately basis points during fiscal year labor and other related expenses decreased basis points to compared with in fiscal this decrease is due in part to the closure of three under performing restaurants and the sale of two other restaurants 
further  the company improved employee utilization in most operating restaurants 
restaurant operating expenses decreased basis points to compared with in fiscal the improvements in restaurant operating expenses are primarily due to cost cutting measures made throughout the store system  especially in restaurants opened since the initial public offering 
rent expense increased on a comparable basis due to the sale leaseback transaction 
the increase in rent expense was offset by a reduction in interest and depreciation expense 
again  the closure of three under performing restaurants and the sale of two other restaurants helped to improve overall operating margins 
general and administrative expenses g a decreased basis points to compared with in fiscal fiscal included  in special charges related to severance agreements and acquisitions   of which was recovered in fiscal on an adjusted basis  fiscal would have been versus for fiscal depreciation and amortization decreased basis points to compared with in fiscal this decrease is the primary result of the sale leaseback transaction involving the sale and leaseback of land  building and improvements of company owned restaurants 
the leases are classified as operating leases 
also  effective the beginning of fiscal  the company changed its estimate of useful lives of certain recently acquired fixed assets  primarily those belonging to mac 
the purpose of the change was to bring the asset lives of casa ole and mac into conformity with each other and with industry norms 
pre opening costs increased basis points to compared with in fiscal approximately half the increase is due to the adoption of aicpa statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop  which requires that costs of start up activities be expensed as incurred 
sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  in fiscal  pre opening costs were deferred and amortized over one year 
pre opening costs consists primarily of hiring and training employees associated with the opening of a new restaurant 
other income expense 
net other expense increased basis points to compared with in fiscal interest income decreased  to  the decrease was due to the constant reduction in interest income as the proceeds from the initial public offering were used for construction projects and debt was incurred related to the acquisition of mac 
interest expense increased  to  although debt was substantially reduced on june  from the million sale leaseback proceeds  the average debt balance in fiscal was higher than the average debt balance in fiscal income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was  which is approximately the expected federal and state rates of and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the company met fiscal capital requirements with cash generated by operations  with draws on its credit facilities and with sale and leaseback financing 
in fiscal  the company s operations generated approximately million in cash  as compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal as of january   the company had a working capital deficit of approximately million  compared with a working capital deficit of approximately million at january  a working capital deficit is common in the restaurant industry  since restaurant companies do not typically require a significant investment in either accounts receivable or inventory 
the company s principal capital requirements are the funding of new restaurant development or acquisitions and remodeling of older units 
during fiscal  capital expenditures on property  plant and equipment were approximately million as compared to approximately million for fiscal the company opened five new restaurants  reopened an existing restaurant and remodeled nine restaurants 
the company re opened one restaurant a conversion from a casa ole to a tortuga coastal cantina in the first quarter of fiscal year and plans to open at least one more restaurant in fiscal year the company also plans to remodel seven restaurants in fiscal year as of the date of this filing  the company has no restaurants under construction 
the estimated capital needed for such openings  along with preparing for openings and for general corporate purposes  including the remodeling of an estimated seven restaurants  is approximately million 
this estimate is based upon an anticipated range of new restaurant investments  from as low as million up to million per restaurant 
approximately  is anticipated to represent furniture  fixtures and equipment and approximately  represents training and pre opening expenses  and is inclusive of the capitalized cost of leasing or acquiring real estate 
this estimate also includes remodel and conversion investments  ranging from as low as  up to  per restaurant 
this estimate  however  does not include any amounts related to any significant acquisitions 
during fiscal  the company amended its credit facility with bank of america 
the terms of the amended credit facility are similar to those in the original facility  however  the facility was increased from a revolving credit facility to a million revolving line of credit 
the interest rate is either the prime rate or libor plus a stipulated percentage 
accordingly  the company is impacted by changes in the prime rate and libor 
the company is subject to a non use fee of on the unused portion of the revolver from the date of the credit agreement 
as of january   the company had million outstanding on the revolving line of credit 
the acquisition of la senorita  which closed on april   used million of the revolving line 
the balance was used for new restaurant construction  remodeling and other working capital needs 
within the terms of the credit agreement  the company must meet certain financial covenants 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company was not in compliance with a debt covenant under the debt agreement 
the bank waived the lack of compliance and amended certain future covenant ratios under the debt agreement 
the amendment also extended the maturity date of the facility to july  and reduced the facility by  at december  and million at december  on april   the company acquired la senorita restaurants  which consisted of five company owned restaurants  a general partnership interest in a sixth restaurant  and all the rights to the la senorita franchise system 
the purchase price for la senorita was approximately million in cash was funded with the company s revolving line of credit with bank of america 
the company s management believes that with its sale leaseback forward commitments with franchise finance corporation of america  along with operating cash flow and the company s revolving line of credit with bank of america  cash flow will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and to finance expansion plans exclusive of any significant acquisitions through the end of the fiscal year 
risk factors the company cautions readers that its business is subject to a number of risks  any of which could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made from time to time in releases  including this form k  and oral statements 
certain risk factors have been presented throughout this document  including  among others  expansion strategy  site selection  attracting and retaining franchisees  managers and other employees  availability of food products  competition and government regulation 
certain other risks to which the company is subject include seasonality 
the company s sales and earnings fluctuate seasonally 
historically the company s highest sales and earnings have occurred in the third and fourth calendar quarters  which the company believes is typical of the restaurant industry and consumer spending patterns in general with respect to the third quarter and is due to increased holiday traffic at the company s mall restaurants for the fourth quarter 
in addition  quarterly results have been and  in the future are likely to be  substantially affected by the timing of new restaurant openings 
because of the seasonality of the company s business and the impact of new restaurant openings  results for any calendar quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year and cannot be used to indicate financial performance for the entire year 
impact of inflation market risks 
the company does not believe that inflation has materially impacted net income during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses  could have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
if operating expenses increase  management intends to attempt to recover increased costs by increasing prices to the extent deemed advisable considering competitive conditions 
the company does not have or participate in transactions involving derivative  financial and commodity instruments 
accelerating growth strategy 
the company s ability to expand by adding company owned and franchised restaurants and acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable locations  the ability to hire  train and retain an adequate number of experienced management and hourly employees  the availability of acceptable lease terms and adequate financing  timely construction of restaurants  the ability to obtain various government permits and licenses and other factors  some of which are beyond the control of the company and its franchisees 
the opening of additional franchised restaurants will depend  in part  upon the ability of existing and future franchisees to obtain financing or investment capital adequate to meet their market development obligations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to open the number of restaurants it currently plans to open or that new restaurants can be operated profitably 
expansion into new geographic markets in which the company has no operating experiences and in which mexican and tex mex food restaurants are less prevalent than in texas has an inherent risk 
consumer tastes vary from region to region in the united states  and there can be no assurance that customers located in the regions of the united states into which the company intends to expand will be as receptive to mexican and tex mex food as those customers in its existing markets 
there can be no assurance as to the success of the company s efforts to expand into other geographic regions or that the cost of such efforts will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
small restaurant base and geographic concentration 
the results achieved to date by the company s relatively small restaurant base may not be indicative of the results of a larger number of restaurants in a more geographically dispersed area 
because of the company s relatively small restaurant base  an unsuccessful new restaurant could have a more significant effect on the company s results of operations than would be the case in a company owning more restaurants 
additionally  given the company s present geographic concentration all company owned units are currently in texas  oklahoma  tennessee  michigan and idaho  results of operations may be adversely affected by economic or other conditions in the region and adverse publicity relating to the company s restaurants could have a more pronounced adverse effect on the company s overall sales than might be the case if the company s restaurants were more broadly dispersed 
control of the company by management and directors 
approximately of the common stock and rights to acquire common stock of the company are beneficially owned or held by larry n 
forehand  david nierenberg  michael d 
domec and louis p 
neeb  directors and or executive officers of the company 
shares eligible for future sale and stock price 
sales of substantial amounts of shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
the company currently has  shares of common stock outstanding 
the company has granted limited registration rights to holders of warrants granted by the company and larry n 
forehand to louis p 
neeb  tex mex partners  lc and a former officer of the company to register the  underlying shares of common stock covered by such warrants in connection with registrations otherwise undertaken by the company 
in any event  the market price of the common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to the company s operating results and other factors 
competition 
the restaurant industry is intensely competitive 
the company competes against other family dining concepts  as well as quick service and casual dining concepts  for customers  employees  franchisees and market partners 
see item business competition 
year during the company reviewed year compliance and attempted to determine the year readiness of third parties such as government agencies  utility companies  telecommunication companies  suppliers and other non technology third party vendors 
the company implemented a plan to minimize the impact of its exposure to year problems 
the company expensed costs associated with its year compliance program as the costs were incurred except for costs that the company would otherwise capitalize new software or hardware costs 
the company s costs associated with its year compliance program did not exceed  the company did not encounter any critical system application or hardware failures during the date rollover to the year  and has not experienced any disruptions of business activities as a result of year failures encountered by customers  suppliers and service providers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have or participate in transactions involving derivative  financial and commodity instruments 
the company s long term debt bears interest at floating market rates 
based on amounts outstanding at year end  a change in interest rates would change interest expense by approximately
