hanover has the option to repurchase the equipment from the trust at any time 
the company feels it has adequate capital resources to fund its estimated level of capital expenditures for the year impact of year the company did not experience any material problems during the rollover to the year that affected operations and does not anticipate any year compliance problems in the future

new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires that  upon adoption  all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recognized in the balance sheet at fair value  and that changes in such fair values be recognized in earnings unless specific hedging criteria are met 
changes in the values of derivatives that meet these hedging criteria will ultimately offset related earnings effects of the hedged item pending recognition in earnings 
sfas is effective for the company beginning in the impact of sfas on the company s financial statements will depend on a variety of factors  including future interpretive guidance from the fasb  the future level of actual foreign currency transactions  the extent of our hedging activities  the type of hedging instruments used and the effectiveness of such instruments 
however management does not believe the effect of adoption will have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
item a
