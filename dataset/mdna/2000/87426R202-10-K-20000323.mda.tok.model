under the terms of the investment agreement with aol  the company has agreed to reimburse aol for losses aol may incur on the sale of any of the  shares during the period from june  through september  the reimbursement amount would be determined by multiplying the number of shares  if any  that aol sells during the applicable period by the difference between the purchase price per share paid by aol  or per share  and the price per share that aol sells the shares for  if less than per share 
the reimbursement amount may not exceed per share for  shares or per share for  shares
