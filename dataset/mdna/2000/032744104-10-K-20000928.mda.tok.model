the company s results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the company designs  develops  and markets integrated microwave components  assemblies  and subsystems for the wireless communications  satellite communications  and defense electronics markets 
the company uses its proprietary multi layer stripline technology to generate compact  lightweight  and cost effective products for use in these markets 
the company offers its integrated assemblies and high end subsystems to leading wireless communications equipment manufacturers such as ericsson  motorola  lucent technologies  and nortel networks and to satellite communications companies such as hughes  lockheed martin  and loral space and communications company 
the company operates predominantly in the wireless communications  satellite communications  and defense electronics markets 
the two reporting segments of the company are the wireless group and the space and defense group 
these groups have been determined based upon the nature of the products and services offered  customer base  technology  availability of discrete internal financial information  homogeneity of products  and delivery channel  and are consistent with the way the company organizes and evaluates financial information internally for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
before the third quarter of fiscal  the company s satellite communications and defense electronics business groups operated as separate reporting segments 
during the third quarter of fiscal  these two groups were combined to more efficiently utilize the engineering  manufacturing  and marketing resources allocated to the separate groups 
increased commonality in the types of products and manufacturing processes required by the groups  coupled with a significant increase in new orders and development activity in the satellite area  was the basis for the change 
the new combined group  the space and defense group  will continue to focus on both the satellite communications and defense electronics markets 
the company recognizes sales at the time products are shipped to its customers or  in the case of customer funded engineering sales  upon achievement of design milestones 
revenues and estimated profits on fixed price contracts are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting on the units of delivery basis 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which the losses are determined 
in april  the company successfully completed a follow on offering in which  new shares of the company s common stock adjusted to reflect a three for two stock split effectuated in the form of a stock dividend paid on june  were sold by the company  including the over allotment option exercised by the underwriters

on february   the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of rf power 
rf power  based in bohemia  new york  had approximately employees as of february   and is primarily engaged in the manufacture of electronic products  including power resistors  attenuators  and couplers 
the purchase price for rf power was  in cash  including direct acquisition costs  and  shares on a post split basis of the company s common stock with an aggregate value of  the company accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations

the increase in sales of wireless products  which consist of catalog surface mount and custom integrated assemblies used in building wireless base station equipment  continues to reflect both the ongoing strong demand by the major base station oems  as well as the company s success in achieving higher dollar content per base station for its latest microwave backplane products 
both shipments of custom backplanes to oems and shipments of xinger r surface mount products to amplifier manufacturers rose significantly in fiscal in response to this demand 
the increase in wireless sales also reflects the inclusion of four months sales of rf power 
sales of space and defense products consist of custom multilayer components and assemblies for communications satellites and defense radar countermeasure subsystems for the military 
sales in the space and defense group fell million  or  for the year ended june   compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decline resulted from both delays in satellite contract awards in the prior fiscal year and the completion of the airborne self protection jammer aspj program contract in the second quarter of fiscal  both of which were events the company anticipated 
sales in this business area are expected to rebound in the second half of fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million of net sales  up million from million of net sales for fiscal this improvement resulted from the increase in sales volume in the wireless group  which resulted in significant economies of scale in the manufacturing operation 
these economies were further enhanced by investment in new automated equipment within the wireless group  which helped to further increase production yields and manufacturing efficiency

the increase in sales of wireless products reflected the increased worldwide demand by major oem customers for both the company s surface mount components and custom subsystems 
wireless sales were further augmented by the first shipments of custom integrated backplane assemblies  which increased the company s dollar content per base station due to the higher level of complexity and functionality of these assemblies 
shipments of space and defense products rose in fiscal due principally to the company being in full production for defense radar countermeasure subsystems for foreign and domestic sales for the aspj program for all of fiscal the aspj program was just entering initial factory production in the first half of fiscal additionally  space and defense sales were bolstered by shipments on a number of small satellite component contracts for hughes and the initial customer funded engineering sales for a satellite subsystem being built for lockheed martin

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses the company s possible exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices  and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
as of june   the company had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable debt securities of million  of which approximately million consisted of highly liquid investments in marketable debt securities 
these investments at the date of purchase normally have maturities between one and months and are exposed to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rate of from june   rates would cause the market price of these securities to fluctuate by an insignificant amount 
due to the relatively short maturities of the securities and the company s ability to hold these investments to maturity  an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a significant effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
over time  however  declines in interest rates will reduce the company s interest income 
the company does not currently own any material equity investments 
therefore  the company does not currently have any direct equity price risk 
all of the company s sales to foreign customers are denominated in united states dollars  and  accordingly  the company is not currently exposed to foreign currency exchange risk
