the company has historicall y financed its growth in sales and the resulting increase in inventory an d receivables through a combination of operating cash flow and borrowings unde r its senior credit facility 
the company s revolving credit line the facility provides fo r borrowings of up to million  subject to certain borrowing base limitations borrowings under the facility bear interest at variable rates at septembe r  and are secured by substantially all of the company s domestic assets the facility matures in june as of september   an additional million was available for borrowings under the facility 
on may   the company entered into a real estate loan rea l estate loan agreement secured by the company s distribution center  cuttin g facility  and administrative offices in tampa  florida

the principa l payments are based on a year amortization with all outstanding principal du e on or before may  under the terms of an interest rate swap agreement  on the first million of borrowings under the real estate loan  interest is payable at a fixe d base rate plus an applicable margin at september  
on th e remainder of the borrowings  interest is payable based on the day libor rat e plus an applicable margin 
as of september   the effective interest rat e on the real estate loan was approximately 
the company has outstanding million of senior subordinated note s the notes that were issued through a private placement 
under the terms o f the indenture underlying the notes  the company is paying semi annual interes t at the rate of through june  at which time the entire principal amoun t is due 
the net proceeds from the notes were used to repay a portion of th e borrowings outstanding under a bridge loan that was used to finance the purchas e of savane in june the company s credit agreements contain significant financial an d operating covenants  including requirements that the company maintain minimu m net worth levels and certain financial ratios  prohibitions on the ability o f the company to incur certain additional indebtedness or to pay dividends  an d restrictions on its ability to make capital expenditures 
during fiscal the company amended the terms of the facility to adjust certain of the financia l covenants 
the company is currently in material compliance with all covenant s under its credit agreements 
pursuant to two separate factoring agreements the factorin g agreements  the company factors substantially all of its accounts receivable the factoring agreements provide that the factor will pay the company an amoun t equal to the gross amount of the company s accounts receivable from customers reduced by certain offsets  including among other things  discounts  returns and a commission payable by the company to the factor 
the commission average s of the gross amount factored 
the factor subjects all sales to its credi t review process and assumes of the credit risk for amounts factore d pursuant to the factoring agreements 
funds are transferred to reduc e outstanding borrowings under the facility once payment is received from th e factor 
the factor pays the company the receivable amount upon the earlier o f i receipt by the factor of payment from the company s customer or ii days past the due date for such payment 
the factoring agreements expire i n as a result of the acquisition of savane in june  certai n consolidation and cost savings activities have transpired that will continue t o impact the company s capital resources 
specifically  the company has chosen t o exit certain owned or leased facilities 
the sale of owned facilities wil l generate cash while the payment of lease termination costs will use cash 
as o f september   the company had assets held for sale with carrying values o f million and has exit related accruals of million 
during fiscal  the company generated million of cash fro m its operations 
this was primarily the result of net income of millio n which included non cash charges of million  a decrease in inventory o f million  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  offset in part by a million increase in accounts receivable 
the company has historically financed its capital expenditures throug h a combination of operating cash flow and long term borrowings

during fiscal  the company anticipates capital expenditures t o total approximately million 
significant capital projects include th e purchase of property in the el paso  texas and tampa  florida areas  th e consolidation of facilities in the el paso texas area  and the upgrade o r replacement of various other equipment and computer systems including hardwar e and software 
on september  and october   the company had workin g capital of million and million  respectively 
the decrease i n working capital was primarily due to a million increase in account s receivable  offset by a million decrease in inventory and a millio n increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the company expects it s working capital needs will continue to fluctuate based on seasonal changes i n sales  accounts receivable and trade accounts payable 
the company believes that its existing working capital  borrowing s available under the facility and internally generated funds provide sufficien t resources to support current business activities 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivativ e instruments and hedging activities 
statement no 
as amended by statemen t no 
 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets o r liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instrument s at fair value 
the company adopted statement no 
on october   a s required 
the company limits its use of derivative financial instruments to th e management of interest rate risk 
the adoption of statement no 
did not hav e a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issue d staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financia l statements 
this was followed by staff accounting bulletin no 
a implementation issues related to sab  in march and by staf f accounting bulletin no 
b  second amendment revenue recognition i n financial statements sab b  in june these bulletins summariz e certain of the sec s views about applying generally accepted accountin g principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the impact of sa b b on the company was to delay the implementation date of sab until th e fourth quarter of fiscal year the future impact of these bulletins on th e company s results of operations is not expected to be material 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has bee n moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in th e economy and relative stability in the company s cost of sales 
in prior years the company has been able to adjust its selling prices and improve efficiencie s to substantially offset increased costs 
while inflation has not had  and th e company does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operatin g results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affecte d by inflation in the future 
risk factors affecting the company s business and prospects to acquire savane we incurred a substantial amount of debt that will requir e successful future operating performance and financial results and may impos e important limitations on us 
to finance our acquisition of savane  we increased our outstandin g indebtedness and our leverage 
the degree to which we are leveraged will hav e important consequences  including the following o a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicate d to the payment of principal and interest on our debt  o our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired  o our leverage may increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and limi t our ability to withstand competitive pressures  o our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities may b e limited  and o our leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in relation to les s leveraged competitors 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on ou r future operating performance and financial results  which will be subject i n part to factors beyond our control 
although we believe that our cash flow wil l be adequate to meet our interest and principal payments  there can be n o assurance that we will generate earnings in the future sufficient to cover ou r fixed charges 
if we are unable to generate earnings in the future sufficient t o cover our fixed charges and are unable to borrow funds from existing credi t facilities or from other sources  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or to sell all or a portion of our assets  eithe r of which may be at terms that are unfavorable to us 
there can be no assuranc e that a refinancing would be possible  nor can there be any assurance as to th e timing of any asset sales or the proceeds that we could realize therefrom 
i n addition  the terms of the debt restrict our ability to sell assets and the us e of the proceeds therefrom 
if for any reason  including a shortfall in anticipated operatin g results or proceeds from asset sales  we were unable to meet our debt servic e obligations  we would be in default under the terms of our existing debt 
in th e event of such a default  some of our lenders could elect to declare certain deb t to be immediately due and payable  including accrued and unpaid interest 
i n addition  such lenders could proceed against the collateral securing the debt which consists of substantially all of our current and future personal property default on our senior debt obligation could result in a default under our othe r debt or result in bankruptcy 
the terms of our existing debt place significant restrictions on our ability t o pursue financial and strategic opportunities 
the terms of our existing debt contain a number of significan t covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to  dispose of assets incur additional debt  repay other debt  pay dividends  make certain investment s or acquisitions  repurchase or redeem capital stock  engage in mergers o r consolidations  or engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries an d affiliates  and engage in certain corporate activities 
there can be no assurance that these restrictions will not adversel y affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage i n other business activities that may be in our best interest 
in addition  th e terms of our existing debt require us to maintain compliance with certai n financial ratios 
our ability to comply with such ratios may be affected b y events beyond our control 
a breach of any of these terms or our inability t o comply with the required financial ratios could result in our default under th e terms of other debt or result in bankruptcy 
we may not be able to successfully identify  acquire and profitably operat e companies and businesses that are compatible with our operations 
we continually evaluate the potential acquisition of other companies brands and producers of complementary product lines 
this includes our effort s to enter into new agreements to license additional brands 
our search may no t yield any complementary companies or brands  and even if we do find a suitabl e acquisition we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund th e purchase 
we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations of an y company that we acquire into our own operations and we cannot assure you tha t the acquired operation will achieve the results we expected 
for example  th e acquired business may not achieve revenues  profits or operational efficiencie s at the same levels as our existing operations or at the levels that it achieve d prior to our acquiring it 
the success of any acquisition will also depend upo n our ability to retain or hire  and then train key personnel 
acquiring anothe r company or business may also have negative effects on our business  results o f operations and financial condition because our officers and directors may focu s their attention on completing the acquisition  or because other resources may b e diverted to fulfilling the needs of the acquisition 
we compete with other companies who have greater resources than we d o for the opportunities to buy other companies and businesses and to expand ou r operations 
as a result  even if we do identify a suitable acquisition  we ma y lose the acquisition to a competitor who offers a more attractive purchas e price 
our financial success is linked to that of our customers  commitment to ou r products and our ability to satisfy and maintain our customers 
our financial success is directly related to the success of ou r customers and the willingness of our customers  in particular our majo r customers  to continue buying our products 
sales to the company s five larges t customers represented approximately  and of net sales durin g fiscal  and  respectively 
sales to wal mart including sam s club  the nation s largest chain of wholesale clubs  accounted fo r approximately  and of net sales during fiscal  an d  respectively 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
sales t o our customers are generally on an order by order basis and are subject to right s of cancellation and rescheduling by the customer or by us 
accordingly  th e number of unfilled orders at any given time is not indicative of the number tha t will eventually be shipped 
if we cannot timely fill our customers orders  ou r relationships with our customers may suffer  and this could have a materia l adverse effect on us  especially if the relationship is with a major customer furthermore  if any of our major customers experiences a significant downturn i n its business  or fails to remain committed to our programs or brands  then thes e customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financia l condition

we are subject to changes in the apparel industry  including changing fashio n trends and consumer preferences 
the apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclica l variations 
a recession in the general economy  or any other events o r uncertainties that discourage consumers from spending  could have a significan t effect on our sales and profitability 
we believe that our success is largel y dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond promptly to changing consume r demands and fashion trends in the design  styling and production of ou r products 
if we cannot gauge consumer needs and fashion trends and respon d appropriately  then consumers may not purchase our products and this would hav e a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financia l condition 
various apparel retailers  some of which are or have been ou r customers  have in recent years experienced financial problems 
many have bee n subject to bankruptcy  restructuring  or liquidation  while others hav e consolidated ownership and centralized buying decisions 
this increases our ris k of extending credit to these retailers  and may lead us to reduce or discontinu e business with such customers  or to assume more credit risk relating to thei r receivables 
either one of these actions could have a material adverse effect o n our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we compete with manufacturers and retailers in the highly competitive appare l industry 
we compete with many apparel manufacturers  including brand name an d private label producers and retailers who have  or may have  the capability t o develop their product and source their products internally 
our products ar e also in competition with many designer and non designer product lines 
ou r products compete primarily on the basis of price  quality  and our ability t o satisfy customer orders in a timely manner 
our failure to satisfy any one o f these factors could cause our customers to purchase products from ou r competitors 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have greate r financial  manufacturing and distribution resources than we do 
if manufacturer s or retailers increase their competition with us  or if our current competitor s become more successful in competing with us  we could experience materia l adverse effects on our business  results of operations and financial condition see business competition 
our use of our trademarks and trade dress may subject us to claims o f infringement by other parties 
we use many trademarks in our business  some of which have bee n registered with the united states patent and trademark office 
we believe thes e registered and common law trademarks and other proprietary rights are importan t to our competitive position and to our success 
the use and registration of ou r trademarks and the use of our trade dress are challenged periodically 
despite our efforts to the contrary  our trademarks and proprietar y rights may violate the proprietary rights of others 
if any of our trademarks o r other proprietary rights were found to violate the proprietary rights of others or were subjected to some other challenge  we cannot assure you that we would b e permitted to continue using these trademarks or other proprietary rights furthermore  if we were sued for alleged infringement of another s proprietar y rights  the party claiming infringement might have greater resources than we d o to pursue its claims  and we could be forced to incur substantial costs t o defend the litigation 
moreover  if the party claiming infringement prevails  w e could be forced to pay significant damages  or to enter into expensive royalt y or licensing arrangements with the prevailing party 
pursuant to licensing agreements  we also have exclusive rights to us e trademarks owned by other companies in promoting  distributing and selling thei r products 
we have periodically been involved in litigation regarding thes e licensing agreements 
we cannot assure you that these licensing agreements wil l remain in effect  or that they will be renewed 
in addition  any future dispute s concerning these licenses may cause us to incur significant litigation costs o r force us to suspend use of the trademarks

our success depends upon our ability to recruit qualified personnel and t o retain senior management 
our continued success is dependent on retaining our senior managemen t as well as attracting and retaining qualified management  administrative an d operating personnel 
if we lose any members of our senior management  or if w e do not recruit and retain other qualified personnel  then our business  result s of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected see business executive officers of the registrant 
additionally  some of our employees are members of unions with whic h the company has entered into collective bargaining agreements 
if upon th e expiration of these agreements  the company is unable to renew or enter into ne w agreements that are satisfactory to the company  the employees covered by thes e agreements may strike or otherwise be unwilling to work for the company 
th e company may not be able to replace these employees in a timely manner 
the los s of these employees may impact the company s ability to manufacture and delive r its products to customers on a timely basis 
fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of the fabrics or other ra w materials we use could increase our cost of sales and reduce our ability to mee t our customers demands 
the principal fabrics used in our apparel consist of cotton  wool synthetic and blended fabrics 
the price we pay for these fabrics is mostl y dependent on the market prices for the raw materials used to produce them namely cotton  wool  rayon and polyester 
depending on a number of factors including crop yields and weather patterns  the market price of these ra w materials may fluctuate significantly 
moreover  only a limited number o f suppliers are available to supply the fabrics at the level of quality w e require 
if we have to procure fabrics from sources other than our curren t suppliers  the quality of the fabric may be significantly different from tha t obtained from our current suppliers 
fluctuations in the price  availability an d quality of the fabrics or raw materials could increase our cost of sales an d reduce our ability to meet our customers demands 
we cannot assure you that w e will be able to pass along to our customers all  or any portion of  an y increases in the prices paid for the fabrics used in the manufacture of ou r products 
see business operations 
we depend upon independent manufacturers in the production of our apparel 
we use independent manufacturers to assemble or produce a substantia l portion of our products 
we depend on these manufacturers ability to financ e the assembly or production of goods ordered and to maintain manufacturin g capacity 
we do not exert direct control over these independent manufacturers however  and so we may be unable to obtain timely delivery of acceptabl e products 
we generally do not have long term contracts with any of thes e independent manufacturers 
as a result  we cannot be assured of an uninterrupte d supply of our product from our independent manufacturers 
if there is a n interruption  we may not be able to substitute suitable alternativ e manufacturers because such substitutes may not be available  or they may not b e able to provide us with products or services of a comparable quality  at a n acceptable price or on a timely basis 
see business operations 
our ability to successfully conduct assembly and production operations i n facilities in foreign countries depends on many factors beyond our control 
during fiscal  a significant portion of our products wer e assembled or produced by independent manufacturers in the dominican republic honduras and mexico 
it is possible that we will experience difficulties wit h these independent manufacturers  including reduced production capacity  failur e to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs as more full y discussed above 
also  using foreign manufacturers requires us to order product s further in advance to account for transportation time 
if we overestimat e customer demand  we may have to hold goods in inventory  and we may be unable t o sell these goods at the same margins as we have in the past 
on the other hand if we underestimate customer demand  we may not be able to fill orders in time 
other problems we may encounter by using foreign manufacturers include but are not limited to work stoppages  transportation delays and interruptions delays and interruptions from natural disasters  political instability  economi c disruptions  expropriation  nationalization  imposition of tariffs  impositio n of import and export controls  and changes in government policies 
we also own one manufacturing facility which operates outside th e united states  and this subjects us to additional risks associated with ownin g and operating manufacturing facilities abroad 
for example  a facility operate d in a foreign country may become subject to that country s labor laws an d government regulations 
if the laws are unfavorable to our operations in an y foreign country  we could experience a loss in revenues  customer orders an d customer goodwill 
we are also exposed to foreign currency risk 
in the past  most of ou r contracts to have goods assembled or produced in foreign countries wer e negotiated in united states dollars 
if the value of the united states dolla r decreases  then the price that we pay for our products could increase  and it i s possible that we would not be able to pass this increase on to our customers see business operations 
our products that are imported into the united states are subject to certai n restrictions and tariffs 
most of our import operations are subject to bilateral textil e agreements between the united states and a number of other countries 
thes e agreements establish quotas for the amount and type of goods that can b e imported into the united states from these countries 
these agreements allow th e united states  in certain circumstances  to impose restraints at any time on th e importation of additional or new categories of merchandise 
future bilatera l textile agreements may also contain similar restraints 
excluding the countrie s covered under cbtpa and nafta  our imported products are also subject to unite d states customs duties 
the united states and the countries in which w e manufacture our products may adjust quotas  duties  tariffs or othe r restrictions currently in effect 
there are no assurances that any adjustment s would benefit us 
these same countries may also impose new quotas  duties tariffs or other restrictions 
furthermore  the united states may bar imports o f products that are found to be made by convicts  or forced or indentured labor the united states may also withdraw the most favored nation status of certai n countries  which could result in the imposition of higher tariffs on product s imported from those countries 
all of these changes could have a materia l adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition see business imports and import regulations 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may affect our operating results an d financial position 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and th e currencies in each of the countries in which we operate  may affect the result s of out international operations reported in us dollars and the value of suc h operations net assets reported in us dollars 
the results of operations an d financial condition of our businesses may be affected by the relative strengt h of the currencies in countries where our products are currently sold 
ou r results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected b y fluctuations in foreign currencies and by translations of the financia l statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into us dollars 
our management information system is an integral part of our operations and mus t be updated regularly to respond to changing business needs 
we rely upon our management information system to provide distributio n services and to track operating results 
further modification and refinemen t will be required as we grow and our business needs change 
if we experience a significant system failure or if we are unable to modify our managemen t information systems to respond to changes in our business needs  then ou r ability to properly and timely produce and distribute our products could b e adversely affected

our sales and income levels are seasonal 
our business has generally been seasonal  with higher sales and incom e in the second and third fiscal quarters 
also  some of our products  such a s shorts and corduroy pants  tend to be seasonal in nature 
if these types o f seasonal products represent a greater percentage of our sales in the future  th e seasonality of our sales may be increased 
this could alter the differences i n sales and income levels in the second and third fiscal quarters from the firs t and fourth fiscal quarters
