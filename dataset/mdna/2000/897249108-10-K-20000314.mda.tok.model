these services include hospital bill auditing  contract compliance review  identification of certain other payments  and cost management consulting services 
the medcap acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
overview of operations for a typical new client  it takes up to six months from the contract signing when the lives are sold to complete the construction of electronic data interfaces necessary for the company to begin providing service 
at this point  the client is considered installed 
during the installation period  the company must also hire and train quality staff necessary to provide contractual services 
after installation  hcri receives files and data from the client from which it creates an inventory of backlog 
backlog is the total dollar amount of potentially recoverable claims that the company is pursuing or auditing on behalf of its clients at a given point in time 
these claims are gross figures  prior to estimates of claim settlements and rejections 
backlog increases when the company opens new files of potentially recoverable claims and decreases when files are recovered and closed or  after further investigation  determined to be nonrecoverable 
backlog for a client will range from newly identified potential recoveries to potential recoveries that are in the late stages of the recovery process 
historically  recoveries the amount actually recovered for its clients prior to the company s fee have been produced from backlog in a generally predictable cycle 
any group of potential recoveries  sufficiently large in number to display statistically significant characteristics and that originates from a defined time period  tend to produce recovery results that are comparable to other groups having similar characteristics 
for the most part  the company is paid contingency fees from the amount of claims recoveries it makes from backlog or recoveries it identifies through other cost containment and related recovery services on behalf of its clients 
the company s revenues are a function of recoveries and effective fee rates 
effective fee rates vary depending on the mix between services provided and client fee schedules 
the fee schedules for each client are separately negotiated and reflect the company s standard fee rates  the services to be provided and anticipated volume of services 
the company grants volume discounts and  for its recovery services  negotiates a lower fee when it assumes backlog from a client because the client will have already completed some of the recovery work 
because the company records expenses as costs are incurred and records revenues only when a file is settled  there is a lag between the recording of expenses and related revenue recognition 
the company s expenses are determined primarily by the number of employees directly engaged in recovery activities cost of services and by the number of employees engaged in a variety of support activities support expenses 
recovery personnel must be hired and trained in advance of the realization of recoveries and revenues 
the number of employees accounted for in support expenses generally grows less rapidly than revenue due to economies of scale 
results of operations the following tables present certain key operating indicators and results of operations data for the company for the periods indicated key operating indicators lives and dollars in millions december  cumulative lives sold  beginning of period lives from acquisitions lives from existing client growth loss lives added from contracts with existing clients lives added from contracts with new clients cumulative lives sold  end of period lives installed backlog  claims recoveries throughput effective fee rate claims revenues employees direct operations support total employees the key operating indicators include the operating performance of subro audit and medcap from their respective acquisition dates of january  and february  backlog represents the total dollar amount of potentially recoverable claims that the company is pursuing on behalf of clients at any point in time 
throughput equals recoveries for the period divided by the average of backlog at the beginning and end of the period 
statements of income as a percentage of subrogation revenues year ended december  claims revenues cost of services support expenses operating income income before income taxes net income compared to revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased  to million from million in growth in claims revenues occurred primarily because of increased claims recoveries  from million in to million in in response to operational changes which affect the company s ability to identify when the parties reached agreement on all material terms  refinements were made to the estimation process with the intent of maintaining consistency in the timing of revenue recognition 
the company believes this change had no significant impact on its revenues for the effective fee rate decreased modestly to from due to the broader mix of services and contracts since the acquisitions 
the increase in total claims recoveries resulted principally from the acquisitions  which increased the baseline recovery operations  backlog and lives installed 
backlog increased to  million at december  from million at december  the company had a throughput rate of approximately and during and  respectively 
lives installed grew in to million 
during the first quarter of  subrogation services generated a lower than historical level of yield from its backlog of subrogation claims 
as used here  yield  referred to as throughput  means recoveries for the period stated as a percentage of the average backlog for the period 
the deterioration in throughput of subrogation claims during appears to have resulted from certain changes made in its claims recovery operations during the second half of and the first quarter of the changes in operations entailed materially increasing the number of files assigned to recovery personnel  which management believes caused the unforeseen decline in throughput 
in response to the decline in throughput  management implemented a plan to reduce the ratio of files to recovery personnel 
management believes that the execution of this plan by year end enabled the company to improve subrogation throughput and recoveries in the fourth quarter 
cost of services 
cost of services increased in to million from million in the increase primarily results from costs associated with operating the acquired companies and additional direct operational employees  including employees hired in response to the plan to reduce the ratio of files to recovery personnel  as described above 
as a percentage of claims revenues  cost of services increased to in from in the increase in cost of services resulted primarily from the acquisitions and a lower growth rate in revenues than in cost of services 
as a result of the nature of the company s contingent fee arrangements with its clients  the company incurs significant current expense in an effort to generate revenue  a significant portion of which will be recorded in future periods 
because relatively little revenue is earned during the first year following the installation of new lives  unless the company assumes responsibility for the new client s existing backlog  the growth rate for lives installed exceeds the revenue growth rate 
support expenses 
support expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in due to hiring of additional support staff for the subrosystem upgrade project  the integration of the acquisitions  and year issues 
support expenses increased as a percentage of claims revenues from for the year ended december  to for the comparable period in the increase in support expenses as a percentage of claims revenues resulted from revenues being lower than anticipated 
support costs do not vary in proportion to revenues 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase in depreciation expense was attributable to the purchase of fixed assets related to the acquisitions and increased system cost upgrades 
the increase in amortization expense was attributable to the addition of intangible assets related to the acquisitions

net income for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million or per diluted share  from million or per diluted share for the year ended december  net income decreased as a result of lower than anticipated subrogation recoveries and the additional expenses  such as amortization and interest expense  associated with the acquisitions 
compared to revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased  to million from million in growth in subrogation revenues occurred primarily because of increased subrogation recoveries  from million in to million in the effective fee rate increased slightly to from 
the increase in total subrogation recoveries was due primarily to growth in backlog  which in turn grew primarily because of an increase in the number of lives installed 
backlog increased to million at december  from million at december  the company was also able to obtain subrogation recoveries at a rate of approximately of average backlog per quarter during and lives installed grew in to million 
cost of services 
cost of services increased in to million from million in  which is an increase of 
as a percentage of subrogation revenues  cost of services decreased to in from in the decrease is a result of lower growth of lives installed and their associated costs in relative to the growth in revenue for the year and increased efficiencies by the company 
as a result of the nature of the company s contingent fee arrangements with its clients  the company incurs significant current expenses in an effort to generate revenue  a significant portion of which will be recorded in future periods 
because relatively little revenue is earned during the first year following the installation of new lives  unless the company assumes responsibility for the new client s existing backlog  the growth rate for lives installed exceeds the revenue growth rate 
support expenses 
support expenses increased  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in due to hiring of additional support staff for the subrosystem upgrade project 
support expenses decreased as a percentage of subrogation revenues from for the twelve months ended december  to for the comparable period in the decline in support expenses as a percentage of subrogation revenues resulted from improved economies of scale in the support functions and also the capitalization of  of certain software development cost associated with the subrosystem upgrade project in these costs were capitalized in compliance with the requirements under statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  adopted by the company january   which were historically expensed 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase in depreciation expense was mainly attributable to the capital expenditures for the subrosystem upgrade project 
compensation charge 
in connection with the sale of the company by medaphis in may  the company incurred a one time million non cash compensation charge

other matters stock repurchase program on march   hcri s board approved a stock repurchase program plan under which the company may repurchase up to million of hcri common stock in the open market  from time to time  at prices per share deemed favorable by it 
during the second quarter of  hcri repurchased  shares of its common stock  at an average purchase price per share of  which is reflected as treasury stock on the balance sheet as of december  no additional shares have been repurchased since the second quarter of adoption of a rights plan on february   the board adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right a right for each outstanding share of common stock of the company 
the dividend was payable to stockholders of record on march  the rights  which will initially trade with the common stock  separate and become exercisable only upon the earlier to occur of i days after the date the stock acquisition date of a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated persons has acquired or more of the common stock such person or group being hereinafter referred to as an acquiring person or ii days or such later date as the board of directors shall determine after the commencement of  or announcement of an intention to make  a tender offer or exchange offer that could result in such person or group owning or more of the common stock the earlier of such dates being called the distribution date 
when exercisable  each right initially entitles the registered holder to purchase from the company one one hundredth of a share of a newly created class of preferred stock of the company at a purchase price of the purchase price 
the rights are redeemable for per right at the option of the board of directors 
the rights expire on march  if any person becomes an acquiring person  each holder of a right will thereafter have the right the flip in right to receive  in lieu of shares of preferred stock and upon payment of the purchase price  shares of common stock having a value equal to two times the purchase price of the right 
also  if at any time on or after the stock acquisition date  i the company is acquired in a transaction in which the holders of all the outstanding shares of common stock immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction are not the holders of all of the surviving corporation s voting power  or ii more than of the company s assets  cash flow or earning power is sold or transferred other than in the ordinary course of business  then each holder of a right shall thereafter have the right the flip over right to receive  in lieu of shares of preferred stock and upon exercise and payment of the purchase price  common shares of the acquiring company having a value equal to two times the purchase price 
if a transaction would otherwise result in a holder having a flip in as well as a flip over right  then only the flip over right will be exercisable 
if a transaction results in a holder having a flip over right subsequent to a transaction resulting in the holder having a flip in right  a holder will have a flip over right only to the extent such holder s flip in rights have not been exercised 
related party transaction on february   the board of directors approved a loan in the amount of  to patrick b 
mcginnis  the chairman and chief executive officer of the company  in exchange for a full recourse promissory note in the same amount from mr 
mcginnis 
the full recourse promissory note bears interest at a rate equal to the company s cost of borrowing under its credit facility  or if no loan amount is outstanding under the credit facility  the federal short term rate 
the  note and accrued interest of  were outstanding at december  the effective rate of interest was approximately external factors the business of recovering subrogation and other claims for healthcare payors is subject to a wide variety of external factors 
prominent among these are factors that would materially change the healthcare payment  fault based liability or workers compensation systems 
examples of these factors include  but are not limited to  the non availability of recovery from such sources as property and casualty and workers compensation coverages  law changes that limit the use of or access to claims and medical records  or the ability of healthcare payors to recover related claims and audit medical records 
because the company s profitability depends in large measure upon obtaining and using claims data and medical records  the non availability or decrease in their availability could have a material adverse effect on the company 
moreover  because the company s revenues are derived from the recovery of the costs of medical treatment  material changes in such costs will tend to affect the company s backlog or its rate of backlog growth  as well as its revenue or its rate of revenue growth 
the healthcare industry  and particularly the business of healthcare payors  is subject to various external factors that may have the effect of significantly altering the costs of healthcare and the environment for the sale or delivery of recovery and cost containment services 
the company is unable to predict which of these factors  if any  could have a potentially material impact on healthcare payors and through them  the healthcare recovery and cost containment industry 
the company provides services to healthcare plans that as of december  covered approximately million lives 
hcri s clients are national and regional healthcare payors  large third party administrators or self insured corporations 
during and  hcri s largest client generated and  respectively  of hcri s revenues 
the loss of this account could have a material adverse effect on hcri s business  results of operations and financial condition 
on december   hcri had backlog of  million 
hcri s revenues are earned under written contracts with its clients that generally provide for contingency fees from recoveries under a variety of pricing regimes 
the pricing arrangements offered by hcri to its clients include a fixed fee percentage  a fee percentage that declines as the number of lives covered by the client and subject to hcri s service increases and a fee percentage that varies with hcri s recovery performance 
year issues the company previously recognized the material nature of the business issues surrounding the computer processing of dates into and beyond the year and took corrective action 
the company s efforts included replacing and testing three basic aspects of its business operations internal information technology it systems  including the internally written systems that support subrogation and bill audit recovery  and internal non it systems  including office equipment  and material third party relationships 
management believes that the company has completed all of the activities within its control to ensure that the company s systems are year compliant and the company has experienced no interruptions to normal operations due to the start of the year the company spent approximately  during related to year readiness  which was higher than the expected total expenditure of  previously disclosed due to the additional costs of contract labor for continued retesting 
the company funded these costs through funds generated from operations and such costs were generally not incremental to existing it budgets  internal resources were re deployed and timetables for implementation of replacement systems were accelerated 
the company does not currently expect to apply any further funds to address year issues 
to date  the company has not experienced any material disruptions of its internal computer systems or software applications  or with the computer systems or software applications of its third party vendors  suppliers or service providers 
the company will continue to monitor these third parties to determine the impact  if any  on the business of the company and the actions the company must take  if any  in the event of non compliance by any of these third parties 
based upon the company s assessment of compliance by third parties  there appears to be no material business risk posed by any such noncompliance 
moreover  the company generally believes that the vendors that supply products to the company for resale are responsible for the products year functionality 
although the company s year rollover did not present any material business interruptions  there are some remaining year related risks  including risks due to the fact that year is a leap year 
these risks include potential product supply issues and other non operational issues 
management believes that appropriate action has been taken to address these remaining year issues and contingency plans are in place to minimize the financial impact to the company 
management  however  cannot be certain that year issues will not have a material adverse impact on the company  since the evaluation process is not yet complete and it is early in the year item a 
quantitative qualitative market risk disclosures the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to its credit facility 
the impact on earnings and value of any debt under its credit facility is subject to change as a result of movements in market rates and prices 
the credit facility is subject to variable interest rates 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under its credit facility
