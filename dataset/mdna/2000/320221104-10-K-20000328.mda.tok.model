item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the results of operations of first financial corp 
and its wholly owned subsidiary  first bank and trust company collectively  the company  depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest earning assets and interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities 
its interest earning assets consist primarily of loans and investment securities  while its interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal home loan bank advances and the senior debenture 
the company s net income is also affected by its level of noninterest income  including fees and service charges  as well as by its noninterest expenses  such as salary and employee benefits  provisions to the allowance for loan losses  occupancy costs and  when necessary  expenses related to other real estate owned oreo and to the administration of nonperforming and other classified assets 
the company reported net income for of  as compared to  for  or an increase of 
diluted earnings per share amounted to per share for  based on  weighted average shares outstanding  as compared to per share for  based on  weighted average shares outstanding 
during  the company recorded two one time transactions 
the first nonrecurring transaction was the sale of oreo at a gain of  the second nonrecurring transaction was a  write off of a long lived asset in recognition of its impaired value 
the after tax impact of these two transactions was to increase net income by  or 
per diluted share 
in  the company s return on average equity roe improved to from in the company s return on average assets roa was in and in the improvement in net income is primarily the result of an increase in net interest income and noninterest income  offset somewhat by an increase in noninterest expense and provision for income taxes 
in general  the company s record performance in is attributable to i an increase in net interest spreads and margins  ii balance sheet growth  predominately within the loan portfolio  iii an increase in the recognition of gains on sba loan sales  and iv continued strength in asset quality 
results of operations net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest income and interest expense  is the single largest contributor to the company s results of operations 
in  net interest income rose  or  to  from  in the primary reason for this increase was due to an increase in average interest earning assets of million  or along with a basis point increase in average net interest spread to in  as compared to in the increase in average interest earning assets was funded largely from deposit growth and other borrowings 
increases in average stockholders equity and an increase in average noninterest bearing deposits  accounted for an increase in average net interest margin of basis points to in in  total interest income amounted to  compared to  in  or an increase of  or 
this increase was attributable to a million  or increase in average interest earning assets  offset somewhat by a basis point reduction in earning asset yield 
the increase in average interest earning assets occurred solely within the higher yielding average loan portfolio which increased million to million 
during  average loans represented of total average interest earning assets compared to during this shifting in earning asset mix and the overall growth of earning assets accounted for the increase in interest income and resulted in only a slight decline in earning asset yield to from 
in terms of rate volume  earning asset growth and the shifting of earning asset mix volume increased interest income by nearly  while the declining rate environment reduced interest income by approximately  the funding for the increase in average earning assets came from a million increase in interest bearing deposits  a million increase in wholesale sources  a million increase in noninterest bearing deposits and  a 
million increase in average stockholders equity 
in early  the company reduced the interest rate paid on transactional deposits by upwards of basis points and implemented a marginal pricing strategy for term deposits 
this aggressive approach to pricing deposits helped reduce cost of funds by basis points to from 
this activity resulted in a decrease in interest expense of  or to  in from  in in terms of rate volume  interest expense increased approximately  due to increases in interest bearing liabilities  while interest expense decreased nearly  due to lowering of interest rates 
overall  as a result of aggressive retail deposit pricing and a declining rate environment  net interest income increased approximately  also  due to balance sheet growth volume predominately within the loan portfolio  net interest income increased approximately  this rate volume activity produced an increase of nearly  to net interest income

salaries and wages increased  to to  during the primary reason for the increase was due to salary increases  additional staff and a larger bonus pool 
during employee benefits increased  or to  from  the increase was primarily related to a  increase in the supplemental executive retirement plan contribution  an  or increase in health insurance costs  a  increase in k costs and  a  increase in payroll taxes 
overall  the increase in benefit costs was a combination of both increased unit cost along with a greater number of employees availing themselves to such benefits 
occupancy expense increased  during however  this increase includes the  write off of a long lived asset in recognition of its impaired value 
exclusive of this write off  occupancy expense increased  or 
the majority of the increase was related to higher tangible personal property taxes and depreciation charges associated with branch building improvements 
equipment expenses increased  or to  from  in the single largest item contributing to this increase was a  increase in equipment maintenance costs  much of which was yk upgrade related

the company s combined federal and state net of federal benefit statutory income tax rate was in and the company s effective combined federal and state tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the exclusion  from state taxable income  interest income on us treasury obligations and certain government agency debt securities in and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
financial condition total assets the company s total assets increased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  the increase in total assets primarily occurred within the company s loan portfolio which increased million and a million increase in cash and cash equivalents 
these increases were offset somewhat by a million decrease in investment securities 
the primary funding source for the increase in total assets was the wholesale funding market 
while retail deposits remained virtually flat at million at december   compared to million at december   repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank advances increased million 
the million senior debenture was repaid during and shareholders equity increased nearly 
million 
investment securities the company s total investment securities portfolio decreased million to million at december   from million at december  at december   securities which were classified as held to maturity were carried at an amortized cost of  with a fair value of  securities classified as available for sale were carried at a fair value of  with an amortized cost of  at december   government agency debt securities and collateralized mortgage obligations were classified as held to maturity which is consistent with the company s intent and ability 
the available for sale segment of investment securities was comprised of us treasury securities  government agency debt securities  mortgage backed securities  and marketable equity securities 
the securities in which the company may invest are subject to regulation and  for the most part  are limited to securities which are considered investment grade securities 
in addition  the company has an internal investment policy which restricts investments to i united states treasury securities  ii obligations of united states government agencies and corporations  iii collateralized mortgage obligations  including securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma  the government national mortgage association gnma  and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  iv securities of states and political subdivisions  v corporate debt  all of which must be considered investment grade by a recognized rating service  and vi corporate stock 
in addition to achieving a rate of return which is consistent with the overall risk profile of the investment portfolio  the company views the principal purpose of its investment securities as a ready source of liquidity and as a management tool against interest rate risk embedded within the company s balance sheet 
generally  the company invests in fixed rate government and agency obligations with a maturity not to exceed three years 
single index floating rate or step up securities generally have final maturities which do not exceed five years at time of purchase 
consequently  the company s exposure to significant market swings is somewhat controlled 
at december   the company s investment securities had net unrealized losses of  as compared to net unrealized gains of  at december  loans total loans  net of unearned discount  amounted to million at december   up million  or  from million at the end of the increase in total loans was predominately in the commercial real estate portfolio  which grew million  while commercial  residential real estate  home equity lines of credit and consumer loans declined million

   residential real estate 
   home equity lines of credit    consumer   unearned discount allowance for loan losses    net loans    in  the company encountered solid loan demand from small businesses 
the company believes a primary reason for this demand was the desire of small business borrowers to obtain banking relationships with banks which are responsive to their needs  and the success of the company in meeting those needs 
the increase in commercial and commercial real estate loans reflected the company s emphasis on i small business lending  ii obtaining loan guarantees from the sba  and iii cash flow analysis and an overall assessment of the borrower s financial strength and ability to repay with a secondary view towards collateral values 
the bank offers a full range of consumer lending products including residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit  new and used automobile loans  passbook and certificate of deposit loans  and other personal secured and unsecured loans 
although the bank makes an effort to price these loans competitively  it faces substantial competition from mortgage and consumer finance companies 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and other real estate owned oreo 
the nonperforming loans category includes loans on which the accrual of interest is discontinued when the collectibility of principal or interest is in doubt  or when payments of principal or interest have become days past due and have arrearages that have not been eliminated 
in certain instances  nonperforming loans may also include loans that have become days past due but remain on accrual status because the value of the collateral securing the loan is sufficient to cover principal and interest and the loan is in the process of collection 
oreo consists of real estate acquired through foreclosure proceedings 
in addition to the preceding two categories  the company may  under appropriate circumstances  restructure loans as a concession to a borrower 
at december   and  no troubled debt restructurings were included in the company s loan portfolio 
the following table sets forth information regarding nonperforming assets and delinquent loans days past due as to interest or principal  and held by the company at the dates indicated 
the amounts and ratios shown are exclusive of the loans and allowance for loan losses acquired in the chariho exeter credit union acquisition 
december  dollars in thousands loans past due days or more but not included in nonaccrual loans nonaccrual loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets delinquent loans days past due nonperforming loans as a percent of gross loans nm nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets delinquent loans days past due as a percent of gross loans allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through provisions charged against income 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management s evaluation of the amounts required to meet estimated charge offs in the loan portfolio after weighing various factors 
among the factors are i the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio generally  ii the quality of specific loans  iii the level of non accruing loans  iv current economic conditions  v trends in delinquencies and prior charge offs  and vi the value of the underlying collateral 
ultimate loan losses may vary significantly from current estimates 
the company reviews nonperforming and performing loans to ascertain whether any impairment exists within the loan portfolio 
the company evaluates these problem loans and estimates the potential loss exposure when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
because the allowance for loan losses is based on various estimates and includes a high degree of judgment  subsequent changes in general economic conditions and the economic prospects of the borrowers may require changes in those estimates 
the bank has an informal loan peer review function and a loan loss review committee 
the loan peer review committee  which meets monthly  is an informal committee comprised of the bank s chief executive officer and all loan officers 
every loan of  or more or a total relationship of  or more is scheduled to be reviewed not less than once every two years by the loan peer review committee 
all loans that undergo loan peer review receive a numerical grade ranging from to based on a number of criteria  including the financial strength of the borrower as determined  in part  by such borrower s liquidity  debt service coverage and historical performance 
any loan rated or worse will automatically be placed on a watchlist 
certain rated loans for which the committee has identified potential problems may also be placed on the watchlist 
the loans on the watchlist are reviewed monthly by the bank s credit committee in order to determine what actions should be taken with respect to such loans  whether any loans should be added or deleted from the watchlist  and to make estimates regarding loan loss exposure to the loan loss review committee 
the loan loss review committee  comprised of the bank s chief executive officer  chief financial officer and all other loan officers  reviews loans on the watchlist on a quarterly basis in order to establish specific loan loss reserve levels 
in addition to assessing loss exposure for all loans included on the watchlist specific allowance  the loan loss review committee also applies a three year moving weighted average  by category  of net charge offs to each loan type general allowance exclusive of watchlist loans which are specifically reviewed 
finally  the loan loss review committee will take into consideration the above mentioned conditions  the effects of which are not directly measured in determining the general and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss regarding these conditions involves a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem loans or loan portfolio types 
thus  an unallocated allowance for loan losses is used to recognize the estimated risk associated with the general and specific allowance calculations and to reflect management s evaluation of various conditions  the effect of which are not directly measurable in determining the general and specific allowance 
the following table  exclusive of the acquired allowance for loan losses  represents the allocation of the bank s allowance for loan losses for the periods ending as indicated december  dollars in thousands loan category commercial commercial real estate  residential real estate home equity lines of credit consumer total    this allocation of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s judgment of the relative risks of the various categories of the bank s loan portfolio 
this allocation should not be considered as an indication of the future amounts or types of loan charge offs

total deposits increased 
million  to million at december   from million at the end of during  the company reported increases in its core transactional type deposit products 
total demand deposits increased million  and savings and money market accounts increased million 
however  time deposits  which are more interest rate sensitive  decreased million 
the company adopted a marginal pricing strategy during and carried the strategy forward into the strategy  which was for the purpose of reducing the company s overall funding costs set time deposit rates at the low end of competitive market rates with replacement funds provided  if necessary  from wholesale funding sources 
during  the company s overall cost of funds declined basis points to  and its cost of funds for time deposits declined basis points to 
along with its deposit gathering efforts  the company relied on borrowing from securities sold under agreements to repurchase repo to leverage its capital 
at december   securities sold under agreements to repurchase amounted to million  compared to million at december  during  the company increased its use of wholesale funding sources from the federal home loan bank of boston fhlb 
the purpose of these borrowings was to match the funding for selected loans as well as refinance maturing repo s at more favorable terms 
at december   advances from the fhlb amounted to million  compared to million at december  asset liability management the principal objective of the company s asset and liability management is to minimize interest rate risk on net interest income and stockholders equity 
this objective is accomplished by managing the ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities within specified maturities or repricing dates 
the company s actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the asset liability management committee which includes members of the company s senior management and two members of the company s board of directors 
the asset liability management committee is actively involved in formulating the economic assumptions that the company uses in its financial planning and budgeting process and establishes policies which control and monitor the company s sources  uses and pricing of funds 
the effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities is analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of falling interest rates  a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
the company has historically sought to maintain a relatively narrow gap position and has  in some instances  foregone investment in higher yielding assets where such investment  in management s opinion  exposed the company to undue interest rate risk 
however  the company does not attempt to perfectly match interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and will selectively mismatch its assets and liabilities to a controlled degree where it considers it both appropriate and prudent to do so 
in managing its interest rate risk exposure  the company does not engage in derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 
other than fixed rate loan commitments  the company is prohibited  by internal policy  from engaging in the use of off balance sheet financial instruments 
there are a number of relevant time periods in which to measure the company s gap position  such as at the three  six  and twelve month points and beyond in the maturity schedule 
management tends to focus most closely on the gap up to the one year point in making its principal funding and investing decisions 
the following table presents the repricing schedule for the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  over over over five three one years within to year to to over three twelve five ten ten months months years years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets securities purchased under agreements to resell  and other   investment securities

for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
by using simulation modeling techniques  the company is able to measure its interest rate risk exposure as determined by the impact of sudden movements in interest rates on net interest income and equity 
this exposure is termed earnings at risk and equity at risk 
at december   the company s earnings at risk under a basis point interest rate shock test measured a negative in a worst case scenario 
under a similar test  the company s equity at risk measured a negative of market value of equity at december  at december   the company s earnings at risk and equity at risk fell well within tolerance levels established by internal policy 
liquidity liquidity is defined as the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
the company further defines liquidity as the ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to earning enhancement opportunities in a changing marketplace 
primary sources of liquidity consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  securities sold under agreement to repurchase  fhlb advances  maturity of investment securities and sales of securities from the available for sale portfolio 
these sources fund the bank s lending and investment activities 
at december   cash and due from banks  securities purchased under agreements to resell  and short term investments unpledged and maturing within one year amounted to million  or of total assets 
management is responsible for establishing and monitoring liquidity targets as well as strategies and tactics to meet these targets 
through membership in the federal home loan bank of boston fhlb  the company has access to both short and long term unused borrowings of nearly million  which could assist the company in meeting its liquidity needs and funding its asset mix 
at december   the company held state and municipal demand deposits of 
million which it considered highly volatile 
nonetheless  the company believes that there are no adverse trends in the company s liquidity or capital reserves  and the company believes that it maintains adequate liquidity to meet its commitments 
the company encountered no unusual liquidity demands as a result of the year issue 
capital resources total stockholders equity of the company at december   was million  as compared to million at december  the increase of 
million primarily resulted from million in net income  less dividends declared of 
million  repurchase of common stock of 
million  and unrealized losses on investment securities of 
million 
the bank is subject to the leverage and risk based capital ratio requirements of the fdic 
the bank is deemed to be well capitalized by the fdic and is classified as such for fdic insurance assessment purposes 
at december   the bank s leverage capital ratio was  as compared to at december  the fdic s minimum leverage capital ratio for adequately capitalized financial institutions is  although this minimum leverage ratio applies only to certain of the most highly rated banks 
other institutions are subject to higher requirements 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
according to these standards  the bank had a tier i risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of at december   as compared to a tier i risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of at december  the minimum risk based tier i and total capital ratios at each of these dates were and  respectively 
the capital structure of the company is subject to the capital ratio requirements of the federal reserve bank  which happens to be the same requirements which fdic imposes on the bank 
at december   the company s leverage capital ratio was  as compared to at december  the company s tier i risk based capital ratio was and its total risk based capital ratio was at december   and and  respectively  at december  year compliance the efficient operation of the company s business is highly dependent on its computer software programs and operating systems 
virtually all of these programs and systems are furnished  supported and maintained by correspondent institutions  computer service and system providers  and software vendors 
in confronting the year problem  the company s board of directors played a very active role in the year compliance effort 
the board approved the year plan and received monthly status reports from members of the project team 
the fdic has also played a very active role and visited the company on several occasions to examine the company s progress 
the company faced potential risks to its and the bank s operations 
as stated above  the company purchases substantially all of its software from third parties who faced the same year challenge as the company 
in addition  the company relies almost exclusively on other companies for the functioning of its automated system 
thus  the company s operations could be adversely affected if the operations of these third parties were adversely affected by the year problem 
most importantly  the company faced risks that all banking institutions  whether large or small  also faced 
included among these risks is the risk that the year date change would result in the inability to process and underwrite loan applications  to credit deposits and withdrawals from customer accounts  to credit loan payments or track delinquencies  to properly reconcile and record daily activity or to engage in similar normal banking activities 
additionally  if those commercial loan customers of the bank whose operations depend heavily on computers and computer software experience year compliance problems and suffer adverse effects with respect to their own operations  their ability to meet their obligations to the bank could be adversely affected 
this could force the bank to increase its provision for loan losses or take more aggressive collection actions  potentially impacting the company s earnings 
at january   the company did not encounter any year date change difficulties 
all systems and operations continued to function without interruption 
the company is not aware of any year difficulties encountered by any of its borrowers 
nonetheless  the company continues to closely monitor the year issue as critical dates emerge throughout the year
