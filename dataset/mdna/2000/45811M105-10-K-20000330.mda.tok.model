the sale was completed effective may  and resulted in the divestiture by the company of substantially all the assets and business of the company s outpatient behavioral health practices 
as of december   the outpatient behavioral health practice business accounted for approximately eighty four percent of the assets of the company before the impact of the write down of assets and the impact of the restructuring charges  and for the year ended december   approximately eighty three percent of the company s net revenues 
as a result of the sale  the company is significantly smaller in terms of revenues and assets 
managed behavioral healthcare prior to  the company was not a direct provider of managed behavioral healthcare services 
during  the company acquired the integra managed behavioral healthcare company which at the time was principally a regional provider of employee assistance programs 
subsequent to the acquisition of integra  the company continued to invest in additional systems and management infrastructure and began actively seeking full risk capitation arrangements with health plans and other managed care organizations 
with the completion of the above mentioned sale and exit of the outpatient provider behavioral health group practice operations  the company elected to change the name of the parent company from apogee  inc to integra  inc 
the company believes the integra name is well established and respected in the behavioral health market 
as indicated elsewhere this business segment has grown significantly since its acquisition  and in particular since segment reporting statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas no 
 was adopted by the company for this standard requires disclosure of segment information on the same basis used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments

during and  the company had two segments eap and managed behavioral healthcare and patient service and provider see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for a financial presentation of the company s segments 
as noted above and further explained in notes and of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company has exited all business lines except for eap and managed behavioral healthcare

the company s revenues are primarily generated through capitated contracts 
revenues are generated entirely in the united states 
approximately of this segment s revenues were generated by seven customers 
the company believes this concentration of revenue over a small customer base is fairly consistent with industry trends 
results of operations the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all wholly owned and beneficially owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions  including management fees  have been eliminated 
with regard to the patient service and provider segment which was completely exited in  because of corporate practice of medicine laws in certain states in which the company operated  the company did not own the professional corporations which operated the professional and clinical aspects of the behavioral health provider operations in those states  but instead had the contractual right to designate  in its sole discretion and at any time  the licensed professional who was the owner of the capital stock of the professional corporation at a nominal cost nominee arrangements 
in addition  the company entered into exclusive long term management services agreements management services agreements with the professional corporations 
through the management services agreements  the company had exclusive authority over decision making relating to all major ongoing operations of the underlying professional corporations with the exception of the professional aspects of the practice of psychiatry  psychology and other professional behavioral healthcare services as required by certain state laws 
under the management services agreements  the company established annual operating and capital budgets for the professional corporations and compensation guidelines for the clinical professionals 
the management services agreements generally had initial terms of ten years or greater 
the method of computing the management fees varied by contract 
management fees were based on either i billings of the affiliated practice less the amounts necessary to pay professional compensation and other professional expenses or ii a license fee per location  reimbursement of direct costs  reimbursement of marketing costs plus a markup  and a flat administrative fee or iii a percentage of gross receipts of the affiliated practice 
in all cases  these fees were meant to compensate the company for expenses incurred in providing covered services plus a profit 
these interests were unilaterally saleable and transferable by the company and fluctuated based upon the actual performance of the operations of the professional corporations 
through the nominee arrangements  the company had a significant long term financial interest in the affiliated practices and  therefore  according to emerging issues task force no 
application of fasb statement no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries  and apb opinion no 
 business combinations  to physician practice management entities and certain other entities with contractual management arrangement  the company consolidated the results of the affiliated practices with those of the company 
because the company must present consolidated financial statements  net revenues are presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
with the sale and exit of the company s provider operations  the company has transferred its rights under the management services agreements  or terminated those relationships

revenues are primarily generated through capitated managed behavioral health and employee assistance programs 
the fees are defined by contract and are primarily calculated on a fixed per member per month fee 
revenues under these contracts are recorded in the month for which the member is entitled to services 
generally  these membership contracts are on a one to three year basis and are subject to various cancellation provisions which are typical to industry practice 
this segment had approximately   and  covered lives at december   and  respectively 
the company estimates the cost of providing services under these agreements  including a reserve for services incurred  but not reported  based upon authorized services  past claim payment experience for member groups patient census data and other facts 
the company typically does not subcapitate the risk of providing services under these contracts  but arranges discounted fee for service rates with independent inpatient and outpatient behavioral health providers  which the company manages 
under capitated contracts  the company is responsible for ensuring appropriate access to care and bears the risk for utilization levels and pricing of the cost of services performed under these contracts 
the company believes the future revenues under these contracts will exceed the costs of services it will be required to provide under the terms of the contracts 
an underestimation in the utilization or price of services for these contracts could result in material losses to the company 
historically  integra has managed these capitated contracts profitably 
the company maintains no re insurance against the risk of loss under these contracts 
eap and managed behavioral healthcare premium revenue for increased to  from  in this increase was the result of the company securing a capitated based contract covering over  lives with a health plan in new york

patient service and provider segment revenue revenue for the patient service and provider segment was reported when earned at the time of service at the estimated amounts to be realized through payments from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered 
third party reimbursement was initially billed at usual  customary and reasonable market rates 
aggregate billings were adjusted when recorded to reflect the estimated amounts realizable from third party payors based on the company s historical experience and contractual rates established with the payors 
patient service revenue represented billings of the company s operations other than its eap and managed behavioral healthcare segment 
as stated above  the company exited all patient service and provider segment operations as of december  patient service revenue for decreased to  from  in this decrease was the result of the execution of the company s plan to sell or shut down all patient service and provider segment operations

selling and administrative expenses decreased to  in from  in as a result of the sale and exit of the outpatient provider operations and downsizing of the company s corporate and regional management offices 
provision for doubtful accounts there was no provision for doubtful accounts in compared to  for this decrease is a result of the sale and exit of the outpatient provider operations 
the company s eap and managed behavioral healthcare segment has historically had minimal provision for doubtful accounts 
the provision for doubtful accounts decreased to  in from  in this decrease was also result of the sale and exit of the outpatient provider operations 
the provision for doubtful accounts was estimated based on an ongoing review of collectibility of the company s accounts receivable 
the company believes the provision for doubtful accounts and the associated allowance for doubtful accounts are adequate based on management s ongoing review of collectibility 
the company recorded additional accounts receivable reserves of  in pertaining largely to the company s long term care business which the company exited in the amounts were included as a component of restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations see restructuring and other charges below 
including these amounts  the provision for doubtful accounts would have been of net revenues in amortization of intangible assets and excess cost over fair value of net assets acquired amortization of intangible assets and excess cost over fair value of net assets acquired decreased to in from in amortization of intangible assets and excess costs over fair value of net assets decreased to in from  in these decreases are a result of the sale and exit of the outpatient operations in in light of the repositioning of the company as a managed behavioral healthcare company and continuing changes in the managed healthcare industry  the company changed its estimated useful life for the excess of cost over fair value of assets acquired from years to years in write down of assets the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  which established accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets  certain identified intangible assets and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used and for long lived assets and certain intangible assets to be disposed of 
in accordance with sfas  the company reviews the realizability of long lived assets  certain intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate recorded costs may not be recoverable 
the company also reviews the overall recoverability of goodwill based primarily on estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if over the remaining useful life of such assets  the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and their estimated fair value 
in estimating future cash flows  the company uses a combination of recent operating results  financial forecasts and budgets  and management estimates and assumptions of factors such as growth and potential future changes when determining whether an asset is impaired  and in measuring assets that are impaired  the company groups assets by geographic region 
the geographic region is the level at which the company contracts with managed care payors  deploys administrative and clinical resources and consolidates back office operations 
in addition  patients and company providers often use clinic locations interchangeably within a geographic region 
upon signing a non binding memorandum of understanding mou with psychpartners in october  the company had an impairment indicator as the fair value of the company s assets included in the mou were less than their respective carrying values 
accordingly  the company performed undiscounted cash flow analyses 
in accordance with the company s policy and sfas  during  the company measured the carrying value of the related intangible assets against the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the continued use of these assets 
the analyses indicated full recovery of the related intangible assets prior to the expiration of their remaining estimated useful lives which were approximately years 
the company changed its strategic direction in december with respect to these assets and the board approved a plan to exit and dispose of the outpatient operations see sale and divestiture of outpatient business 
accordingly  in december  the company revised its cash flow analyses to reflect the cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets prior to their disposal as well as the proceeds expected to result from their disposal based upon the terms of the purchase agreement with psychpartners and recorded a charge of  to write down the carrying amounts of these businesses to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the sale was completed as of may  net revenues for all of the outpatient group practices were approximately  and  and recorded loss from operations including an allocated amount of corporate overhead was approximately and  in and  respectively  excluding the above write down of assets and restructuring and other charges 
based upon these fundamental changes in the nature of integra s business  management s ability to operate and grow the business  no change in estimating fair value cash are indicated for restructuring and other charges this charge is comprised of the following years ended december  c restructuring charges   long term care and provider billing reserves  change in estimate restructuring  provider billing restructuring charges in december  the company recorded a provision for restructuring pertaining to the company s decision to divest the outpatient provider group practices operations that were not sold to psychpartners  and to reorganize corporate office functions to reflect the exit from the outpatient business 
the writedown of assets included a goodwill impairment charge of  associated with the operations the company exited 
the remainder of the write down of assets consisted primarily of fixed assets related to the discontinued operations 
when the company reached the decision to exit the outpatient business  in accordance with its policy and sfas  the company measured the carrying value of the related assets against the estimated fair market value for these remaining operations less costs to dispose and recorded the above writedown 
contract termination costs pertain primarily to accrued costs for lease terminations  and storage of clinical records 
employee severance costs included the accumulation of benefits set forth in the company s severance policy which were paid to approximately of the company s employees who were terminated as a result of the restructuring plan 
the primary employee groups affected included clinical and administrative personnel at western region clinic locations and regional and corporate staff 
the company s restructuring plan was substantially completed in in january  psychpartners filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws 
based on discussions with psychpartners personnel it intends to discontinue all future operations and liquidate all existing assets to satisfy outstanding obligations 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  psychpartners assumed responsibility for all facility leases associated with the practices sold 
while the company obtained assignment letters for many of these leases  the company is evaluating whether it may have contingent exposure under these agreements 
the company is in the process of coordinating with psychpartners  the landlords and special counsel which the company engaged to assist in this matter 
the company estimates there are approximately open leases with approximately  in remaining payments under the lease terms  not including certain fees and expenses for which the company may be responsible 
the company intends to aggressively pursue resolution of part of the lease situations in terms most favorable to the company 
due to the nature of real estate law  it is probable the company will be responsible for a portion of these remaining lease obligations 
accordingly  the company recorded a charge of  at december   for this potential exposure 
in addition to the above lease exposure  psychpartners defaulted on certain deferred contingent purchase price obligations which were part of the original acquisition agreements for practices previously purchased by integra 
these liabilities were also assumed by psychpartners under the terms of the purchase agreement 
the company believes it has no remaining responsibility for these obligations  however  the individuals associated with these practices may choose to assert a claim against the company 
at december   the company has not established a reserve for these amounts which it estimates may aggregate to  the company intends to vigorously contest any claims related to this matter 
as part of its ongoing evaluation of these reserves  at june   the company determined  based on its assessment of all remaining open matters at that time  that the company was over accrued for these matters by this change in estimate is offset by additional restructuring reserves of  recorded in the fourth quarter relating to the lease exposure as a result of psychpartners chapter bankruptcy filing as discussed above 
during  the company also completed execution of the restructuring plan which discontinued the company s long term care operations  exited and consolidated underperforming outpatient locations and reduced management and overhead costs 
under these plans  approximately of the company s employees were terminated and the company wrote off assets consisting primarily of goodwill in the amount of  and fixed assets related to the restructured operations

the terms of this settlement included a repayment of approximately  which the company made during additionally  during  the company entered into a corporate integrity agreement the agreement with the oig whereas the company agreed to undertake certain compliance obligations 
the company  as required under the terms of the agreement and with the assistance of outside auditors  filed its first annual report with the oig in december as of march   no response has been received from the oig 
there were certain findings in the audit report that management is in the process of resolving 
the company believes  due to the nature of the findings  no reserve for potential liability is required at december  in march  the company received notification that the medicare intermediary in california completed a post payment medical review of billings previously submitted and paid between and based on the results of their review  the intermediary has requested a refund of approximately  services were denied primarily on the basis of medical necessity and incomplete documentation 
the company has requested an administrative hearing 
as of december   the company was fully reserved for the above amount 
in april  the company received notice that the office of the attorney general of new york state the state was conducting an audit of the new york medicaid billings of one of the outpatient provider operations with which it had an administrative services agreement 
the state was investigating whether the company had any liability arising from the operation of  and its relationship with that provider 
in october  the company terminated its agreements with that provider

although management believes that established reserves for the above matters are sufficient  it is possible that the final resolution of these matters may exceed the established reserves by an amount which could be material to the company s results of operations 
due to the nature of these matters the company cannot predict when these matters will be resolved 
the company does not believe the ultimate outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s overall financial condition  liquidity or operations

the company s current ratio  working capital and debt to equity ratio are set forth below for the dates indicated december  december  current ratio 

working capital deficit   debt to equity 
potential impact of year computer issues the year problem is primarily the result of two potential malfunctions that could have an impact on the company s systems and equipment 
the first problem arises due to computers being programmed to use two rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
the second problem arises in embedded chips where microchips and microcontrollers have been designed using two rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
certain of the company s computers  programs  and building infrastructure components eg alarm systems and hvac systems are date sensitive and may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the company relies on information technology it systems and other systems and facilities such as telephones  building access control systems and heating and ventilation equipment embedded systems to conduct its business 
these systems may have been potentially vulnerable to year problems due to their use of date information 
the company also has business relationships with customers and healthcare providers and other critical vendors who are themselves reliant on it and embedded systems to conduct their businesses 
state of readiness 
the company s internal it systems are largely centralized and consist primarily of purchased software 
the company s it hardware infrastructure is built mainly around ibm pc compatible servers and desktop systems 
the company s it software primarily utilizes microsoft systems including sql server  windows nt  internet information server  exchange and office 
the company believes these systems are compliant at december  the company s clinical and claims administration software has been certified by the vendor as being year compliant 
the company has completed testing of this system and believes it to be compliant 
year remediation costs incurred in and were and  respectively 
external relationship 
the company also faced the risk that one or more of its critical suppliers or customers external relationships would not be able to interact with the company due to the third party s inability to resolve its own year issues  including those associated with its own external relationships 
the company has assessed its external relationships and risk rating each external relationship based upon the potential business impact  available alternatives and cost of substitution 
the company attempted to determine the overall year readiness of its external relationships 
in the case of significant customers and mission critical suppliers such as banks  telecommunications providers and other utilities and it vendors  the company engaged in discussions with the third parties and obtained information as to those parties year plans and state of readiness 
the company believes its external relationships will be year ready 
risks and contingency recovery planning 
if the company s year issues were unresolved  it is possible the company would not have the ability to accurately and timely authorize and process benefits and claims  accurately bill customers  assess claims exposure  determine liquidity requirements  report accurate data to management  stockholders  customers  regulators and others  and would be subject to business interruptions or shutdowns  financial losses  reputational harm  loss of significant customers  increased scrutiny by regulators and litigation related to year issues 
the company attempted to limit the potential impact of the year by monitoring the progress of its own year project and those of its critical external relationships and by developing contingency recovery plans 
the company has developed contingency recovery plans aimed at maintaining the continuity of critical business functions before and after december  and through march  as part of that process  the company has developed manual work alternatives to automated processes which will be designed to maintain business continuity 
these manual alternatives presume  however  that basic infrastructure such as electrical power and telephone service  as well as purchased systems which are advertised to be year compliant by their manufacturers primarily it hardware and software will remain unaffected by the year problem 
the company engaged various testing techniques using integra  inc information technology staff and external consultants during the last half of minor problems revealed as a result of such testing were corrected 
integra s y readiness was deemed complete in december no significant problems were encountered and the company believes it will not have future difficulty 
inflation a significant portion of the company s operating expenses have been subject to inflationary increases  including clinical and administrative salaries and rent expense 
based on management s assessment  the company has historically been unable to substantially offset inflationary increases through price increases but believes the company has somewhat mitigated the effect by expanding services and increasing operating efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to offset future inflationary increases in expenses  if any  which would result in a dilutive impact on the company s future earnings 
however  management is currently in the process of exploring a variety of e commerce and internet based strategies to reduce potential future operating costs and gain the benefit of potential efficiencies through the use of appropriate technology
