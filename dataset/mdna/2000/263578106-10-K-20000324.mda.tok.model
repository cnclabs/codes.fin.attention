the additional million proceeds of the term loans were used to reduce revolver borrowings 
working capital was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the increase is primarily due to increases in inventory related to the opening of additional stores during  the reversal of the valuation reserve on the current portion of the deferred tax asset and increases in accounts receivable due to additional volume 
the company s ebitda increased by million or to million in compared to ebitda as a percentage of sales was in as compared to in for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in net cash provided was increased cash earnings partially offset by increases in working capital and decreases in other liabilities associated with new store additions and the timing of disbursements 
for fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was million  compared to million for fiscal net cash used in investing activities in was due to capital expenditures of million primarily related to the opening and remodeling of new and renovated stores and capital expenditures related to the conversion of rock bottom stores to the duane reade format  million for lease acquisition and pharmacy file acquisition costs  million to purchase six love s stores and a pasteur pharmacy offset by proceeds of million from the sale of assets 
net cash used in investing activities in was due to the rock bottom acquisition and capital expenditures related to the opening of new stores  store remodeling  lease and pharmacy file acquisition costs 
for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million  compared to million for fiscal the net cash provided in was primarily due to additional borrowings under credit facilities 
the net cash provided in was primarily from the proceeds of the public offering and additional bank borrowings 
the company s capital requirements primarily result from opening and stocking new stores and from the continuing development of management information systems 
the company believes that there are significant opportunities to open additional stores  and currently plans to open approximately to stores during the next two years 
the company expects to spend approximately million in fiscal on capital expenditures primarily for new and replacement stores and an additional million for lease and pharmacy file acquisition costs 
working capital is also required to support inventory for the company s existing stores 
historically  the company has been able to lease its store locations 
leases for seven of the company s stores that generated approximately of the company s net sales for fiscal are scheduled to expire before the end of fiscal the company believes that it will be able to renew such leases on economically favorable terms or  alternatively  find other economically attractive locations to lease 
as of december   approximately  of the company s approximately  employees were represented by various labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
pursuant to the terms of such collective bargaining agreements  the company is required to pay certain annual increases in salary and benefits to such employees 
the company does not believe that such increases will have a material impact on the company s liquidity or results of operations 
the company believes that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including additional borrowings under the existing credit agreement  will be adequate for at least the next two years to make required payments of principal and interest on the company s indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to comply with the terms of its debt agreements 
as of december   the company had borrowed approximately million under the revolving portion of its bank credit facility and had approximately million of remaining availability 
the ability of the company to meet its debt service obligations and reduce its total debt will be dependent upon the future performance of the company and its subsidiaries which  in turn  will be subject to general economic  financial  business  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond the company s control 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of its indebtedness in the future 
substantially all of the company s borrowings under the existing credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  therefore  the company s financial condition will be affected by the changes in prevailing interest rates 
the company has entered into an interest rate protection agreement for million of its floating rate debt that caps libor rates at 
theis agreement expires in november see note to consolidated financial statements 
tax benefits from net operating losses at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million  which are due to expire in the years through these nols may be used to offset future taxable income through and thereby reduce or eliminate the company s federal income taxes otherwise payable 
the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  imposes significant limitations on the utilization of nols in the event of an ownership change  as defined in section of the code the section limitation 
the section limitation is an annual limitation on the amount of pre ownership change nols that a corporation may use to offset its post ownership change income 
the section limitation is calculated by multiplying the value of a corporation s stock immediately before an ownership change by the long term tax exempt rate as published by the internal revenue service 
generally  an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if the aggregate increase in the percentage of stock ownership by value of that corporation by one or more shareholders including certain groups of shareholders who in the aggregate own at least of that corporation s stock exceeds percentage points over a three year testing period 
the recapitalization caused the company to experience an ownership change 
as a result  the company currently is subject to an annual section limitation of approximately million in and and approximately million from to on the amount of nols generated prior to the recapitalization that the company may utilize to offset future taxable income 
nols generated by the company since the recapitalization approximately million are not subject to the section limitation and may be used to offset future taxable income 
there can be no assurance that any nols will be able to be used by the company to offset future taxable income or that such nols will not become subject to limitation due to future ownership changes 
however  based on the company s recent and projected performance  management believes that it is more likely than not that the full value of the nol s will be realized 
seasonality in general  sales of drugstores items such as prescription drugs  otc drugs and health and beauty care products exhibit limited seasonality in the aggregate  but do vary by product category 
quarterly results are primarily affected by the timing of new store openings and the sale of seasonal products 
in view of the company s expansion of seasonal merchandising  the company expects slightly greater revenue sensitivity relating to seasonality in the future 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on results of operations for the company during the three years ended december  recently issued accounting pronouncements fasb statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires that derivative instruments such as options  forward contracts and swaps be recorded as assets and liabilities at fair value and provides guidance for recognition of changes in fair value depending on the reason for holding the derivative 
the company does not presently have significant transactions involving derivative instruments  but may do so in the future 
the company is required to adopt statement no 
for the first quarter of and may adopt it earlier 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk the financial results of the company are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt which carries variable interest rates 
variable rate debt outstanding under the existing credit agreement was approximately million at december   which is somewhat lower than the company expects its outstanding variable rate debt to be during the next twelve months 
the anticipated outstanding balances  however  are not expected to be materially greater than at december  based on the december  outstanding balances  a change in interest rates would affect pre tax annual results of operations by approximately million 
the company also has million of senior notes outstanding at december  these notes  which bear interest at a fixed annual rate of  are not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations 
the principal objective of the company s investment management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to facilitate the funding needs of the company 
as part of its investment management  the company may use derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps 
during  in connection with the existing credit agreement requirements  the company entered into an interest rate protection agreement for million of its floating rate debt 
this agreement expires in november of and caps the libor rate at see note to consolidated financial statements
