liquidity and capital resources the company historically has met its cash requirements and financed its growth principally through cash flows generated from operations 
during the past decade  the company has operated in a soft market cycle which is characterized by excess insurance capacity and declining insurance premium rates 
the company s primary sources of cash flow are proceeds from the sale or maturity of invested assets  premiums earned  investment income  commission income and management fees 
the company s short term cash requirements are primarily for claims payments  reinsurance premiums  commissions  salaries  employee benefits and other operating expenses  and the purchase of investment securities  which have historically been satisfied from operating cash flows 
due to the uncertainty regarding settlement of unpaid claims  the long term liquidity requirements of the company may vary  and the company has attempted to structure its investment portfolio to take into account the historical payout patterns 
management believes that the company s current cash flows are sufficient for the short term needs of its insurance business and the company s invested assets are sufficient for the long term needs of its insurance business 
the company also purchases reinsurance to mitigate the effect of large claims and to help stabilize demands on its liquidity 
on a consolidated basis  net cash provided from operations was million for  million for and million for the positive cash flows for said periods were primarily attributable to net premiums written  net earnings  and increases in reserves for unpaid losses 
because workers compensation and general liability claims may be paid over an extended period of time  the company has established loss reserves for such lines of business 
the assets supporting the company s reserves continue to earn investment income until claim payments are made 
total assets increased from million at december  to million at december  and to million at december   primarily due to increases in premiums receivable  reinsurance recoverables and real estate investments 
cash  invested assets and notes receivable increased from million at december  to million at december  and to million at december  as a result of increases in net premiums written and investment income 
the company completed its stock repurchase program of  common shares of the company on december  at a total cost of  american safety is an insurance and financial services holding company whose principal assets are its investment portfolio and its investment in the capital stock of its subsidiaries 
american safety s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders will depend  to a significant degree  on the ability of the company s subsidiaries to pay dividends to american safety 
the jurisdictions in which american safety and its insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect the solvency of insurers 
harbour village development 
american safety announced in march its plans to complete development of the harbour village golf and yacht club  located in ponce inlet  florida  consisting of residential condominium units  a marina containing boat slips  a par golf course and beach club 
the property  acquired by american safety through foreclosure in april  has been under development through its ponce lighthouse properties  inc subsidiary 
while the property was being marketed for sale  deposits have been received for in excess of million of pre construction sales that have been generated under american safety s development effort 
it is anticipated that harbour village will be developed in three phases over the next three to five years  depending on future sales activities and economic conditions that may impact the marketing of the condominium units 
the company intends to obtain an acquisition and development loan and a revolving bank credit facility in order to construct in sequence the three phases of harbour village 
the anticipated construction cost for the entire project is in excess of million 
financing in the approximate amount of million will be required for construction of phase i 
the company has received a proposal for the bank credit facility  and is in the process of obtaining a commitment for such credit facility 
phase i of the development consists of construction of all site work including a boat slip marina  residential units  and amenities 
no assurance can be given  however  as to either future sales activities of the condominium units or the impact of local and national economic conditions on the company s marketing efforts for harbour village 
management believes that the company will be able to obtain a bank credit facility which  together with anticipated cash flows from marketing and sales operations  will meet the liquidity needs for the construction and development of phase i of harbour village during the first months of development 
there can be no assurance  however  that the amounts available from the company s sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet the company s future capital needs 
income taxes american safety is incorporated under the laws of bermuda and  under current bermuda law  is not obligated to pay any taxes in bermuda based upon income or capital gains 
american safety has received an undertaking from the minister of finance in bermuda pursuant to the provisions of the exempted undertakings tax protection act  which exempts american safety and its shareholders  other than shareholders ordinarily resident in bermuda  from any bermuda taxes computed on profits  income or any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate  duty or inheritance until march  the company  exclusive of its united states subsidiaries  does not consider itself to be engaged in a trade or business in the united states and accordingly does not expect to be subject to direct united states income taxation 
the company s us subsidiaries are subject to taxation in the united states 
impact of inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses are known and therefore before the extent by which inflation may affect such expenses is known 
consequently  the company attempts  in establishing its premiums  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
however  for competitive and regulatory reasons  the company may be limited in raising its premiums consistent with anticipated inflation  in which event the company  rather than its insureds  would absorb inflation costs 
inflation also affects the rate of investment return on the company s investment portfolio with a corresponding effect on the company s investment income 
combined ratio the combined ratio of an insurance company measures only the underwriting results of insurance operations and not the profitability of the overall company 
the company s reported combined ratio for its insurance operations may not provide an accurate indication of the company s overall profitability from insurance and reinsurance programs due to the exclusion of fee and commission income and expenses generated in related management and agency subsidiaries 
depending on the company s mix of business going forward  the combined ratio may fluctuate from time to time and may not reflect the overall profitability of insurance programs to the company 
reserves certain of the company s insurance policies and reinsurance assumed  including general and pollution liability policies covering environmental remediation risks  as well as workers compensation policies  may be subject to claims brought years after an incident has occurred or the policy period has ended 
the company is required to maintain reserves to cover its estimated liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred 
the company engages an independent internationally recognized actuarial consulting firm to provide reserve studies  opinions and rate studies 
reserves are estimates at a given time  which are established from actuarial and statistical projections by the company of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims occurring on or prior to such time  including claims that have not yet been reported to the insurer 
the establishment of appropriate loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no assurance that the ultimate payments will not materially exceed the company s reserves 
year the year issue was the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
if not corrected  computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year during  the company  together with consulting outside vendors  reviewed its information technology systems ie  underwriting  insureds  claims and accounting and the systems have proved to be year compliant by processing date information accurately and without interruption when required to process dates in the year and beyond 
in the context of the year issue  the company identified the following general categories of business partners as material to the company s ability to conduct its operations software  hardware and telecommunication providers  banks and investment managers  insurance brokers  agents and producers  reinsurers and reinsurance intermediaries and utilities 
the company contacted with its material business partners to determine their state of readiness with regard to year compliance and the potential impact on the company 
based on the information available to the company  the company could not identify a material business partner that was not compliant with respect to the year issue 
the company has conducted a review of its underwriting guidelines and policies  and has determined that the insurance policies issued by the company did not insure year claims 
however  changing social and legal trends may create unintended coverage for claims by reinterpreting insurance contracts and exclusions 
it is impossible to predict what  if any  exposure insurance companies may ultimately have for year claims whether coverage for the issue was specifically excluded or included 
the company spent less than  on hardware and software relating to year compliance and the company does not anticipate any significant additional expenditures with respect to the year issue
