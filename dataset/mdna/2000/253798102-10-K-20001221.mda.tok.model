other developments on october   the company acquired inside out networks  a leading developer of data connection products based in austin  texas 
the acquisition provides a comprehensive suite of local connectivity solutions to the market 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
acquired in process research and development acquisition of itk international  inc 
in july  the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of itk 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including estimated restructuring and integration costs of million 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
at the time of the company s acquisition  itk described itself as a remote access server ras product company 
although itk did offer its own line of isdn cards and networking boards  the company s acquisition was made principally to acquire the voip technology under development by itk 
this voip technology  if successfully developed  would allow users to send packetized voice signals through the internet 
the company believed that the voip technology under development at the time of the acquisition could provide for the development of products which would be a natural item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued acquired in process research and development continued acquisition of itk international  inc 
continued extension of the company s current product offerings and could position the company to address substantially larger markets than the markets served by the company s current products 
at the time of the acquisition  itk had developed a proof of concept prototype product netblazer which demonstrated that the method of voice and data compression under development by itk and the method of combining voip and remote access functionality under development by itk had the potential to be further developed into a product marketable to carrier class telephone companies 
however  the netblazer required further development before it could meet the technical and functional requirements of such customers 
accordingly  the company was uncertain whether the voip technology being developed would ultimately meet the technical requirements of carrier class telephony customers or whether it would be commercially viable 
as of the date of the acquisition  the nature of the development efforts related to the purchased  in process research and development projects  as well as the efforts required to complete development of those projects into commercially viable products  included development projects to address the following a development of enhanced technical attributes  including enhanced port density  redundancy  network management capabilities  a higher fault tolerance  compliance with telephone industry standards such as ss and nebs compliancy  b development of significant hardware and software functions considered integral to a product with broad appeal to end users and the telephone companies  including computer to phone capabilities  interoperability with other vendor s gateways  one stage dialing  local tone simulation and announcements  end to end transparent disconnect cause delivery and real time fax over capabilities  among others  and c re engineering of the prototype design to permit cost effective manufacture and commercial use  including migration from a unix operating system to a windows nt operating system 
management estimated that million of the purchase price represented the fair value of purchased in process research and development related to the voip projects referred to above  that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
these amounts were expensed as a non recurring  non tax deductible charge upon consummation of the acquisition 
the identifiable intangible assets of million included in the purchase price allocation were comprised of proven technology with an estimated fair value of million and an assembled workforce with an estimated fair value of million  which had estimated useful lives of five years and six years  respectively 
the remaining unallocated purchase price represented goodwill of million  which was being amortized over seven years 
with regard to the proven technology  the company intended to further enhance the strengths of this product range and implement a plan to gain leadership in the isdn market 
the company s core asset was the comprehensive set of common application programming interface capi and capi enhancing features combined with highly intelligent isdn protocol implementation which provided for integration into server based communication solutions for the media communication market 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an million charge reflecting the write down of the carrying value of all of the intangible assets associated with the netblazer technology and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued acquired in process research and development continued acquisition of itk international  inc 
continued some of the goodwill acquired in the company s july purchase of itk 
the write down resulted from the company s march decision to discontinue development of the netblazer technology when the key technical members of the netblazer technology team elected to leave the company and the company concluded that it would not be able to successfully develop a competitive product from the technology 
accordingly  the company determined that future undiscounted cash flows from the acquired itk assets would be substantially reduced  and therefore  the carrying value of the acquired itk assets would be impaired 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the company recorded a charge of million reflecting a write down of the remaining carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill associated with the integrated services digital network isdn technology and some of the other long lived assets acquired in the company s july purchase of itk 
the write down resulted from the company s september decision to discontinue all business activities in the isdn market 
the company determined that it did not have the capability to invest at the levels necessary to achieve significant market share in the isdn market and  therefore  has discontinued development activities associated with the isdn product lines 
accordingly  the company determined that future undiscounted cash flows from the remaining acquired itk intangible assets would be reduced and  therefore  the carrying value of the remaining acquired itk intangible assets would be impaired 
acquisition of central data corporation in july  the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of cdc 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including estimated restructuring and integration costs of million 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
although cdc did offer its own line of traditional serial port connectivity products  the company s acquisition was made principally to acquire the usb technology under development by cdc 
this usb technology  if successfully developed  would broaden the company s product offerings to include this new  emerging industry standard port technology 
management considers such a product offering integral to its future market share because the marketplace is migrating from the traditional serial i o input output technology in which the company has significant market share to usb technology 
at the time of acquisition  cdc had developed a prototype of both the port and port usb connectivity technologies that demonstrated the validity of cdc s product development plan 
however  the usb technology development was still in process  and required significant development work and field testing before it could meet the technical and functional requirements of customers and achieve commercial viability 
accordingly  the company was uncertain whether the technology being developed could ultimately meet the technical and economic requirements of the marketplace and become commercially viable 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued acquired in process research and development continued acquisition of central data corporation continued as of the date of the acquisition  the nature of the development efforts related to the purchased  in process research and development projects  as well as the efforts required to complete development of those projects into commercially viable products included a development of new hardware designs and software engineering relating to a complete reengineering of the in process usb technology  b development of new hardware designs for port usb products  and c development of a new hub architecture to support the cdc usb technology 
management estimated that million of the purchase price represented the fair value of purchased in process research and development related to the usb projects referred to above  that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
these amounts were expensed as a non recurring  non tax deductible charge upon consummation of the acquisition 
the identifiable intangible assets of million included in the purchase price allocation were comprised of proven technology with an estimated fair value of million  and an assembled workforce with an estimated fair value of million  which had estimated useful lives of five years and six years  respectively 
the remaining unallocated purchase price represented goodwill in the amount of million  which was being amortized over seven years 
the company has developed the acquired in process usb research and development and released usb products  with initial product revenues generated during november usb revenues of approximately million and million  for fiscal years and  respectively  are included in revenues from the first release of certain usb products 
actual revenues are below original projections due to delays in the release and marketing of certain usb products 
the company s efforts have been more heavily focused on the terminal server technologies  which had already been developed and were generating most of the post acquisition cdc revenues  and accordingly  the original revenue projections for usb have not been realized 
on october   the company acquired inside out networks  a leading developer of data connection products 
the acquisition will allow the company to offer the most competitive and complete usb product line in the industry 
as inside out networks is the market leader in usb  the company expects that the usb products currently being sold will eventually be superceded by the inside out networks usb product lines 
however  the company expects to continue to utilize the usb technology purchased in the cdc acquisition

aetherworks corporation write off and note recovery in connection with the company s previously purchased million of convertible notes from aetherworks corporation  in may the company exchanged such notes for a non interest bearing million non convertible note and was released from all of its guarantees of certain lease obligations of aetherworks 
due to significant uncertainty as to its collectibility  the million note was recorded by the company as having no carrying value 
in march  the company received payment of million  representing payment on the aforementioned non convertible note of aetherworks corporation 
the note was paid as a result of aetherworks corporation being acquired by nx networks  inc income taxes the company recorded a million tax benefit for  and tax provisions of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the tax benefit in is recorded at a rate less than the us statutory rate primarily due to non deductible charges and amortization  partially offset by the non taxable gain recognized upon recovery of the aetherworks corporation note 
for fiscal  the company recorded taxes at a rate in excess of the us statutory rate primarily due to the amortization of the identifiable assets and goodwill acquired in the purchase of itk and cdc which were not deductible for income tax reporting purposes 
for fiscal  the company recorded a tax provision despite incurring a loss primarily due to the write off of acquired in process research and development which was not deductible for income tax reporting purposes

this action caused some of the company s european transactions to be negotiated  invoiced  and paid in euros 
the conversion will most likely add currency exchange costs and risks  although such costs and risks are not quantifiable at this time

during  the average monthly exchange rate for the us dollar to the deutschemark dropped by approximately from
