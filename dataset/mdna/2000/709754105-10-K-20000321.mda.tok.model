item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth below under risk factors 
overview penwest pharmaceuticals co 
penwest or the company  is engaged in the research  development and commercialization of novel drug delivery technologies 
the company has extensive experience in developing and manufacturing tabletting ingredients for the pharmaceutical industry 
the company s product portfolio ranges from excipients that are sold in bulk  to more technically advanced and patented excipients that are licensed to customers 
on august  the distribution date  penwest became an independent  publicly owned company when penford corporation penford  the company s former parent  distributed the distribution to the shareholders of record of penford common stock on august  all of the shares of the company s common stock 
pursuant to the distribution  each penford shareholder of record received three shares of the company s common stock for every two shares of penford common stock held by them 
the company has incurred net losses since as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
the company expects net losses to continue at least into mid a substantial portion of the company s revenues to date have been generated from the sales of the company s pharmaceutical excipients 
the company s future profitability will depend on several factors  including the successful commercialization of timerx controlled release products  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in sales of its pharmaceutical excipients products 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve profitability or that it will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly basis  if at all 
under most of the company s collaborative agreements  the company is entitled to receive milestone payments  royalties on the sale of the products covered by such collaborative agreements and payments for the purchase of formulated timerx material 
substantially all the timerx revenues generated to date have been milestone fees received for products under development as well as sales of formulated timerx 
there can be no assurance that the company s controlled release product development efforts will be successfully completed  that required regulatory approvals will be obtained or that approved products will be successfully manufactured or marketed 
the company s results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the volume and timing of orders of the company s pharmaceutical excipients and on variations in payments under the company s collaborative agreements including payments upon the achievement of specified milestones 
the company s quarterly operating results may also fluctuate depending on other factors  including variations in gross margins of the company s products  the mix of products sold  competition  regulatory actions  litigation and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
results of operations years ended december  and total revenues increased by in to million from million in product sales increased to million in from million in representing an increase of 
the increase in product sales was primarily due to increased sales volumes of emcocel  as well as increased sales volumes of formulated bulk timerx in anticipation of mylan s launch of nifedipine xl 
as a result of the company s new agreement with mylan  mylan has agreed to purchase from the company formulated bulk timerx for manufactured nifedipine xl in although mylan has retained the marketing rights to the mg strength of nifedipine xl  the company does not anticipate that mylan will be purchasing formulated bulk timerx from the company prospectively as mylan will not be manufacturing the finished product 
the company added two new emcocel customers in december  which contributed to most of the volume increase in royalties and licensing fees relating to the timerx drug delivery system increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  due to the timing of when development milestones were earned 
gross profit increased to million or of total revenues in from million or of total revenues in gross profit percentage on product sales increased to in from in the increase in gross profit percentage was partly due to increasing margins on emcocel products due to volume based manufacturing efficiencies  increased sales of prosolv and formulated timerx  which have higher margins  as well as increased development revenues under collaborative agreements utilizing the timerx technology 
selling  general and administrative expenses were comparable from year to year at million 
the expenses included a one time charge of million relating to the write off of costs associated with the decision to outsource certain manufacturing as opposed to constructing a new manufacturing facility 
research and development expenses increased by in to million from million in the increased spending in relates primarily to increased funding of clinical development programs under the company s collaborative agreement with endo 
for the company recorded an income tax benefit of principally as a result of valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets primarily attributable to the net operating loss for the year 
for the company recorded an income tax benefit of principally as a result of operating losses generated by the company in the period prior to august  that were utilized by penford 
years ended december  and total revenues increased by in to million from million in product sales increased to million in from million in representing an increase of 
the increase in product sales was primarily due to increased sales volumes of emcocel 
the company added one significant emcocel customer early in and two additional large pharmaceutical companies in december which resulted in additional shipments of emcocel late in december royalties and licensing fees relating to the timerx drug delivery system decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  due to the timing of when development milestones were earned 
gross profit increased to million or of total revenues in from million or of total revenues in the increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to improved product mix within product sales 
this increase  however  was partially offset by a decrease in royalties and licensing fees for the year 
gross profit percentage on product sales increased to in from in this improvement in gross profit percentage on product sales was due to increasing sales of formulated timerx and prosolv  which have higher margins than traditional excipients  as well as increasing margins on emcocel products due to volume manufacturing efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by in to million 
the asset write off expenses included a one time charge of million relating to the write off of costs associated with the decision to outsource certain manufacturing as opposed to constructing a new manufacturing facility 
research and development expenses increased by in to million from million in the increased spending in relates primarily to additional biostudy activity related to the development of timerx controlled release products as well as increased funding under the company s collaborative agreement with endo 
for the company recorded an income tax benefit of principally as a result of operating losses generated by the company in the period prior to the august  that were utilized by penford 
for the company recorded income tax expense of primarily because net operating losses for the year were utilized by penford and the company was not compensated for these losses 
liquidity and capital resources prior to the distribution  the company received intercompany advances from penford to fund the company s operations  capital expenditures and the original acquisition of the company s predecessor  which aggregated million 
upon the distribution  penford contributed the outstanding intercompany indebtedness and certain other assets and liabilities to the capital of the company 
since the distribution  the company has funded its operations and capital expenditures from cash from operations and advances under a credit facility 
the company had an available credit facility which was a revolving loan facility of million of unsecured financing the credit facility 
penford guaranteed the company s indebtedness under the credit facility 
on march   the company completed a private placement of equity in which it sold million shares of newly issued common stock to selected institutional and other accredited investors for million 
the company received approximately million  after fees 
approximately million was used to repay the existing outstanding balance under the credit facility as required by the terms of the credit facility and the credit facility is no longer available to the company 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and million of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
with the termination of the credit facility  the company has no committed sources of capital and no indebtedness to any third or related parties 
as of december   the company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company has entered into a strategic alliance agreement with endo and the company expects to expend an additional million  primarily in and on the development of a drug 
the company expects to rely on cash generated from operations as well as proceeds from its equity financing to fund expenditures 
however  the company may be required to raise additional funds to continue its development activities under the endo agreement 
however  either the company or endo may terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice  at which time the company s funding obligations would cease 
the company had negative cash flow from operations in each of the periods presented primarily due to net losses for the periods as well as higher trade receivables over december  funds expended for the acquisition of fixed assets were primarily related to efforts at the company s manufacturing facility in iowa to increase capacity 
funds expended for intangible assets include costs to secure and defend patents on technology developed by the company and secure trademarks 
following the march financing  the company anticipates that its existing capital resources  as well as cash generated from operations  will enable it to maintain currently planned operations through at least mid however  this expectation is based on the company s current operating plan  which could change as a result of many factors and the company could require additional funding sooner than anticipated 
the company s requirements for additional capital could be substantial and will depend on many factors  including i the timing and amount of payments received under existing and possible future collaborative agreements  ii the structure of any future collaborative or development agreements  iii the progress of the company s collaborative and independent development projects  iv revenues from the company s traditional excipients  v the costs to the company of bioequivalence studies for the company s products  vi the prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and vii the development of manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
market risk and risk management policies the operations of the company are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s interest rate risk consists of cash flow risk associated with borrowing under its variable rate credit facility 
the company s international subsidiaries transact a substantial portion of their sales and purchases in european currencies other than their functional currency  which can result in the company having gains or losses from currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company does not use derivatives to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies or interest rates 
the company does not believe that the potential exposure is significant in light of the size of the company and its business 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on the company s future operating results or cash flows 
recent accounting developments in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab requires that license and other upfront fees received from research collaborators be recognized over the term of the agreement unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
sab requires a company to follow its guidance no later than the first quarter of its fiscal year beginning after december  through a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company has not yet determined the impact of its implementation of sab on the company s financial statements 
year many computer programs and applications define the applicable year using two digits rather than four in order to save memory and enhance the speed of repeated data based calculations 
the year problem refers to the inability of these computer programs on or after january  to recognize that refers to rather than 
the term year compliant means a computer or a computer system  which has been designed or modified to recognize dates on or after january  the company established programs to coordinate its year yk compliance efforts across all business functions and geographic areas 
the company used the following four phases in executing its yk compliance program assessment  remediation  testing and contingency planning 
these phases were completed during the company has not experienced any material yk problems since the date change on january  however  there can be no assurance that problems will not arise for the company  its suppliers  its customers or others with whom the company does business later in  with systems that have not yet been fully tested 
the company intends to continue to monitor its compliance  as well as the compliance of others whose operations are material to the company s business 
euro conversion on january   certain member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
between january  and january   transactions may be conducted in either the euro or the participating countries national currency 
however  by july   the participating countries will withdraw their national currency as legal tender and complete the conversion to the euro 
the company conducts business in europe and does not expect the conversion to the euro to have an adverse effect on its competitive position or consolidated financial position 
the company s existing systems allow the company to conduct business transactions in both the euro as well as other foreign currencies 
this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends  may  and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements contained in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
these factors include the risk factors listed below 
risk factors our controlled release products that are generic versions of branded controlled release products that are covered by one or more patents may be subject to litigation we expect that our collaborators will file andas for our controlled release products that are generic versions of branded controlled release products that are covered by one or more patents 
it is likely that the owners of the patents covering the brand name product or the sponsors of the nda with respect to the branded product will sue or undertake regulatory initiatives to preserve marketing exclusivity  as pfizer did with respect to nifedipine xl 
any significant delay in obtaining fda approval to market our product candidates as a result of litigation  as well as the expense of such litigation  whether or not we or our collaborators are successful  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on mylan and other corporate collaborators to conduct full scale bioequivalence studies and clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals for  and manufacture  market  and sell our timerx controlled release products we develop and commercialize our timerx controlled release products in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies 
we are parties to collaborative agreements with third parties relating to certain of our principal products 
we are relying on mylan to conduct full scale bioequivalence studies and clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals for  and manufacture  market and sell one of our timerx controlled release products  and endo to develop and commercialize a controlled release version of numorphan 
we are also dependent on mylan with respect to the marketing and sale of the mg strength of pfizer s generic version of procardia xl 
our collaborators may not devote the resources necessary or may otherwise be unable to complete development and commercialization of these potential products 
our existing collaborations are subject to termination without cause on short notice under certain circumstances 
if we cannot maintain our existing collaborations or establish new collaborations  we would be required to terminate the development and commercialization of our potential products or undertake product development and commercialization activities at our own expense 
moreover  we have limited or no experience in conducting full scale bioequivalence studies and clinical trials  preparing and submitting regulatory applications and manufacturing  marketing and selling our timerx controlled release products 
we may not be successful in performing these activities 
our existing collaborations and any future collaborations with third parties may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
factors that may affect the success of our collaborations include the following our collaborators may be pursuing alternative technologies or developing alternative products  either on their own or in collaboration with others  that may be competitive with the product as to which they are collaborating with us  which could affect our collaborator s commitment to the collaboration with us  reductions in marketing or sales efforts or a discontinuation of marketing or sales of our products by our collaborators would reduce our revenues  which will be based on a percentage of net sales by the collaborator  our collaborators may terminate their collaborations with us  which could make it difficult for us to attract new collaborators or adversely affect our perception in the business and financial communities  and our collaborators may pursue higher priority programs or change the focus of their development programs  which could affect the collaborator s commitment to us 
we have not been profitable we have incurred net losses since our inception  including net losses of approximately million  million and million during  and  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
a substantial portion of our revenues have been generated from the sales of our pharmaceutical excipients 
our future profitability will depend on several factors  including the timing of the commercial launch by mylan of pfizer s generic version of the mg strength of its procardia xl in the united states  the successful commercialization of our controlled release products for which regulatory approval currently is pending  the completion of the development of other pharmaceuticals using our timerx controlled release technology  an increase in sales of our pharmaceutical excipient products  and our funding obligations under certain of our collaborations 
we face significant competition  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is affected by new technologies  governmental regulations  health care legislation  availability of financing  litigation and other factors 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  marketing  legal and other resources than we do and than certain of our collaborators do 
our timerx business faces competition from numerous public and private companies and their controlled release technologies  including alza s oral osmotic pump oros r technology  multiparticulate systems marketed by elan and biovail  traditional matrix systems marketed by skyepharma  plc and other controlled release technologies marketed or under development by andrx corporation  among others 
in addition to developing controlled release versions of immediate release products  we have concentrated a significant portion of our initial development efforts on generic versions of branded controlled release products 
the success of generic versions of branded controlled release products based on our timerx technology will depend  in large part  on the intensity of competition from the branded controlled release product  other generic versions of the branded controlled release product and other drugs and technologies that compete with the branded controlled release product  as well as the timing of product approval 
competition from other generic versions of branded controlled release products will also reduce the royalty rate to be paid to us under several of our collaborations 
the generic drug industry is characterized by frequent litigation between generic drug companies and branded drug companies 
those companies with significant financial resources will be better able to bring and defend any such litigation 
in our excipients business  we compete with a number of large manufacturers and other distributors of excipient products  many of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
our principal competitor in this market is fmc corporation  which markets its own line of mcc excipient products 
we may require additional funding our requirements for additional capital could be substantial and will depend on many factors  including the timing and amount of payments received under existing and possible future collaborative agreements  the structure of any future collaborative or development agreements  o the progress of our collaborative and independent development projects  revenues from our excipients business  the costs to us of clinical studies for our products  the prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the development of manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
after the march  financing see part ii  item  we have no committed sources of capital 
we may seek additional funds through collaborative arrangements and public or private financing 
additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our then existing stockholders will result 
in addition  the terms of the financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of such stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products which we otherwise pursue on our own 
our success depends on our protecting our patents and patented rights our success depends in significant part on our ability to develop patentable products  to obtain patent protection for our products  both in the united states and in other countries  and to enforce these patents 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical firms  including us  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  patents may not issue from any patent applications that we own or license 
if patents do issue  the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  issued patents that we own or license may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology 
our success also depends on our not infringing patents issued to competitors or others 
we are aware of patents and patent applications belonging to competitors and others that may require us to alter our products or processes  pay licensing fees or cease certain activities 
we may not be able to obtain a license to any technology owned by a third party that we require to manufacture or market one or more products 
even if we can obtain a license  the financial and other terms may be disadvantageous 
our success also depends on our maintaining the confidentiality of our trade secrets and patented know how 
we seek to protect such information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  licensees and pharmaceutical companies 
these agreements may be breached by such parties 
we may not be able to obtain an adequate  or perhaps  any remedy to such a breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 
we are involved in and may become involved in additional patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings relating to our products or processes which could result in liability for damage or stop our development and commercialization efforts the pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by significant litigation and interference and other proceedings regarding patents  patent applications and other intellectual property rights 
in addition to the recently dismissed litigation involving mylan  pfizer and the still pending litigation involving mylan and bayer  we may become parties to  or our products or products based on our timerx controlled release technology may become the subject of  additional patent litigation and other proceedings in the future 
the types of situations in which we may become parties to such litigation or proceedings include we or our collaborators may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties to enforce our patent rights 
we or our collaborators may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties to seek to invalidate the patents held by such third parties or to obtain a judgment that our products or processes do not infringe such third parties patents 
if our competitors file patent applications that claim technology also claimed by us  we or our collaborators may participate in interference or opposition proceedings to determine the priority of invention 
if third parties initiate litigation claiming that our processes or products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights  we and our collaborators will need to defend against such proceedings 
an adverse outcome in any litigation or other proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to cease using the technology that is at issue or to license the technology from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
the cost of any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
although the legal costs of defending litigation relating to a patent infringement claim unless such claim relates to timerx in which case such costs are our responsibility are generally the contractual responsibility of our collaborators  we could nonetheless incur significant unreimbursed costs in participating and assisting in the litigation 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation and proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater resources 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete in the marketplace 
patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time 
in  the boots company plc filed in the european patent office  or the epo  an opposition to a patent granted by the epo to us relating to our timerx technology 
in june  the epo dismissed boots opposition  leaving intact all claims included in the patent 
boots has appealed this decision to the epo board of appeals  but no judgment has been rendered 
we can provide no assurance that we will prevail in this matter 
if our clinical trials are not successful or take longer to complete than we expect  we may not be able to develop and commercialize certain of our products in order to obtain regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of certain of our potential products  including controlled release versions of immediate release drugs and new chemical entities  our collaborators will be required to complete clinical trials in humans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the products 
our collaborators may not be able to obtain authority from the fda or other regulatory agencies to commence or complete these clinical trails 
the results from preclinical testing of a product that is under development may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials 
in addition  the results of early human clinical trials may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in larger scale advanced stage clinical trials 
furthermore  we  one of our collaborators  or the fda may suspend clinical trails at any time if the subjects or patients participating in such trails are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  or for other reasons 
the rate of completion of clinical trials is dependent in part upon the rate of enrollment of patients 
patient accrual is a function of many factors including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study and the existence of competitive clinical trials 
delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and program delays 
we and our collaborators may not be able to successfully complete any clinical trial of a potential product within any specified time period 
in some cases  we may not be able to complete the trial at all 
moreover  clinical trials may not show any potential product to be safe or efficacious 
thus  the fda and other regulatory authorities may not approve any of our potential products for any indication 
our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we or our collaborators are unable to complete a clinical trial of one of our potential products  the results of any clinical trial are unfavorable  or the time or cost of completing the trial exceeds our expectations 
we may not obtain regulatory approval  the approval process can be time consuming and expensive the development  clinical testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation in the united states and other countries 
this regulatory approval process can be time consuming and expensive 
we may encounter delays or rejections during any stage of the regulatory approval process based upon the failure of clinical data to demonstrate compliance with  or upon the failure of the product to meet  the fda s requirements for safety  efficacy and quality  and those requirements may become more stringent due to changes in regulatory agency policy or the adoption of new regulations 
after submission of a marketing application  in the form of an nda or an anda  the fda may deny the application  may require additional testing or data and or may require postmarketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product 
while the us food  drug and cosmetic act  or fdca  provides for a day review period  the fda commonly takes one to two years to grant final approval to a marketing application nda or anda 
further  the terms of approval of any marketing application  including the labeling content  may be more restrictive than we desire and could affect the marketability of products incorporating our controlled release technology 
many of the controlled release products that we are developing with our collaborators are generic versions of branded controlled release products  which require the filing of andas 
certain anda procedures for generic versions of controlled release products are the subject of petitions filed by brand name drug manufacturers  which seek changes from the fda in the approval process for generic drugs 
these requested changes include  among other things  tighter standards for certain bioequivalence studies and disallowance of the use by a generic drug manufacturer in its anda of proprietary data submitted by the original manufacturer as part of an original new drug application 
any changes in fda regulations that make anda approvals more difficult may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other products containing our timerx controlled release technology require the filing of an nda 
a full nda must include complete reports of preclinical  clinical and other studies to prove adequately that the product is safe and effective  which involves  among other things  full clinical testing  and as a result requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
in certain cases involving controlled release versions of fda approved immediate release drugs  we may be able to rely on existing publicly available safety and efficacy data to support an nda for controlled release products under section b of the fdca when such data exists for an approved immediate release version of the same chemical entity 
however  we can provide no assurance that the fda will accept such section b nda  or that we will be able to obtain publicly available data that is useful 
the section b nda process is a highly uncertain avenue to approval because the fda s policies on section b ndas have not yet been fully developed 
there can be no assurance that the fda will approve an application submitted under section b in a timely manner or at all 
the fda also has the authority to revoke or suspend approvals of previously approved products for cause  to debar companies and individuals from participating in the drug approval process  to request recalls of allegedly violative products  to seize allegedly violative products  to obtain injunctions to close manufacturing plants allegedly not operating in conformity with current good manufacturing practices gmp and to stop shipments of allegedly violative products 
the fda may seek to impose pre clearance requirements on products currently being marketed without fda approval  and there can be no assurance that the company or its third party manufacturers or collaborators will be able to obtain approval for such products within the time period specified by the fda 
even if we obtain marketing approval  our products will be subject to ongoing regulatory review if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for costly post marketing follow up studies 
as to products for which marketing approval is obtained  the manufacturer of the product and the manufacturing facilities will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the product  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we may be subject to fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
the market may not be receptive to products incorporating our timerx controlled release technology the commercial success of products incorporating our controlled release technology that are approved for marketing by the fda and other regulatory authorities will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and third party payors as clinically useful  cost effective and safe 
other factors that we believe could materially affect market acceptance of these products include the timing of the receipt of marketing approvals and the countries in which such approvals are obtained  the safety and efficacy of the product as compared to competitive products  and the cost effectiveness of the product and the ability to receive third party reimbursement 
we have only limited manufacturing capabilities and will be dependent on third party manufacturers 
we lack commercial scale facilities to manufacture our timerx material in accordance with current gmp requirements prescribed by the fda 
we currently rely on a third party pharmaceutical company for the bulk manufacture of our timerx material for delivery to our collaborators 
there are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under gmp regulations capable of manufacturing our timerx material 
we have not yet qualified a second source of supply 
in the event that our current manufacturer is unable to manufacture the timerx material in the required quantities or at all  we may be unable to obtain alternative contract manufacturing  or obtain such manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms 
if our third party manufacturer fails to perform its obligations  we may be adversely affected in a number of ways  including our collaborators may not be able to meet commercial demands for our products on a timely basis  our collaborators may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials of products that are under development  and our collaborators may be delayed in submitting applications for regulatory approvals of our products 
we have limited experience in manufacturing timerx material on a commercial scale and no facilities or equipment to do so 
if we determine to develop our own manufacturing capabilities  we will need to recruit qualified personnel and build or lease the requisite facilities and equipment 
we may not be able to successfully develop our own manufacturing capabilities 
moreover  it may be very costly and time consuming for us to develop such capabilities 
the manufacture of any of our products both timerx material and excipients is subject to regulation by the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries 
any delay in complying or failure to comply with such manufacturing requirements could materially adversely affect the marketing of our products and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent upon a sole source supplier for the gums used in our timerx material and upon a limited number of suppliers for the wood pulp used in the manufacture of our excipients our timerx drug delivery system is a hydrophilic matrix combining primarily two polysaccharides  xanthan and locust bean gums  in the presence of dextrose 
we purchase these gums from a sole source supplier 
emcocel and prosolv  our two largest selling excipients  are manufactured from a specialty grade of wood pulp 
we have qualified alternate suppliers with respect to these materials  but we can provide no assurance that interruptions in supplies will not occur in the future or that we will not have to obtain substitute suppliers 
any interruption in these supplies could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture bulk timerx for delivery to our collaborators or to manufacture these excipients 
if our collaborators fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement by third party payors for our controlled release products  they may not be able to successfully commercialize controlled release products in certain markets the availability of reimbursement by governmental and other third party payors affects the market for any pharmaceutical product 
these third party payors continually attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care by challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
in certain foreign countries  particularly the countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control 
the generic versions of controlled release products being developed by us and our collaborators may be assigned an ab rating if the fda considers the product to be therapeutically equivalent to the branded controlled release drug 
failure to obtain an ab rating from the fda would indicate that for certain purposes the drug would not be deemed to be therapeutically equivalent  would not be fully substitutable for the branded controlled release drug and would not be relied upon by medicaid and medicare formularies for reimbursement 
in both the us and certain foreign jurisdictions  there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system 
further proposals are likely 
the potential for adoption of these proposals may affect our ability to raise capital  obtain additional collaborative partners and market our products 
if we or our collaborators obtain marketing approvals for our products  we expect to experience pricing pressure due to the trend toward managed health care  the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals 
we may not be able to sell our products profitably if reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount 
we will be exposed to product liability claims and may not be able to obtain adequate product liability insurance our business exposes us to potential product liability risks which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products 
product liability claims might be made by consumers  health care providers or pharmaceutical companies or others that sell our products 
these claims may be made even with respect to those products that are manufactured in licensed and regulated facilities or that otherwise possess regulatory approval for commercial sale 
we are currently covered by primary product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and million annually in the aggregate on a claims made basis and by umbrella liability insurance in excess of million which can also be used for product liability insurance 
this coverage may not be adequate to cover any product liability claims 
product liability coverage is expensive 
in the future  we may not be able to maintain or obtain such product liability insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability claims 
any claims that are not covered by product liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile the market price of our common stock  like the market prices for securities of pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  have historically been highly volatile

residual year issues may adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and relationships with customers and suppliers prior to january   there was a great deal of concern regarding the ability of computer programs and hardware and other equipment to adequately recognize st century dates from th century dates due to the two digit date fields used by many systems 
for example  computer programs that have time sensitive components may recognize a date represented as as the year rather than the year in addition  programs may have failed to recognize february  as a leap year date as a result of an exception to the calculation of leap years that did occur in the year and otherwise occurs only once every years 
as of march   our computer programs and hardware and other equipment are functioning normally and the compliance and remediation work performed by us appears to be effective to prevent any problems 
however  computer experts have warned that there may still be residual consequences of the change in centuries 
if residual year issues cause the failure of any of the computer programs and hardware and other equipment necessary to operate our business  our business  financial position and results of operations  as well as our relationships with customers and suppliers  may be adversely affected 
furthermore  if third parties of business importance to us do not successfully and timely anticipate and address their own residual year issues  any residual year issues that arise could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations
