year the year issue relates to the way computer systems  software and some equipment define calendar dates  they could fail or make miscalculations due to interpreting a date including to mean  not in  the company determined that certain of its computer software was originally programmed using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  this software would not be able to process transactions beyond december  the assessment phase of the company s software  systems and equipment began in it was initially determined that the systems most likely to be affected by the year issue were the general accounting systems and payroll 
to remedy the year issue with regard to these areas  the company began devoting substantial resources to replace the affected software with a new enterprise wide technology system which would also significantly improve the company s overall information systems 
as of december   the implementation status of general accounting systems and payroll was complete for the entire company

the focus team determined that the company s equipment with embedded systems was year compliant and the company s equipment was not  for the most part  calendar date sensitive 
the focus team also concluded that the key risk factors associated with year were those from outside the company such as the readiness of its key material suppliers  dealers  customers  financial institutions and public infrastructure suppliers 
the focus team prioritized and communicated with third party suppliers about the status of their compliance with year issues and was assured by of its high priority mission critical suppliers that they were year compliant 
despite their assurances  due to the uncertainty of the year readiness of third parties  the company continued to be cautious of the consequences of year failures of third parties that could have had a material impact on the company s operations  such as the worst case scenario where production would be halted by the inability of a single source supplier to deliver critical product or component 
while the company obtained assurance from its mission critical third parties that they would be compliant  there was no assurance that the systems of any third party on which the company s operations relied would be compliant 
nevertheless  based on their assurances  the company did not anticipate a material impact on its operations from direct interfaces with third parties 
the company has not experienced any problems related to the year issue and at this date the company has no reason to believe there will be any significant problems in the future in connection with the year issue
