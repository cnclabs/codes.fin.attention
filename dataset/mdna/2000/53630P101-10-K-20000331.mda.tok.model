item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continuation of new business activity and change of principal business emphasis in  the company began participating in the commercial real estate lending business as a direct lender through bridge financial corporation bfc or bridge  a wholly owned subsidiary 
during and  the company continued to reposition its historical static assets from real estate development and sales into commercial real estate lending

the company increased the portfolio properties from two properties at the end of to five properties at the end of the three additional properties were acquired in a tax deferred exchange following the sale of the apartments previously owned by the company in new mexico 
the portfolio contributes positive pre tax revenue and cash flow and is not management intensive 
the company will evaluate future real estate sales on a case by case basis to determine if a tax deferred exchange for other industrial properties is appropriate 
management expects the short term commercial real estate lending business to provide more stable earnings patterns for the company when compared to the company s historical pattern 
this is because the earnings pattern in the real estate development and sales industry is very dependent upon the occurrence of large and sometimes isolated transactions  which are not readily predictable 
furthermore  an increase in real estate assets does not necessarily translate into a concurrent increase in revenue or earnings  such increases are often deferred until the asset is liquidated 
the lending business is  on the other hand  more likely to have a predictable stream of interest income from a portfolio of assets 
the assets begin to contribute to earnings immediately upon acquisition  consequently loan portfolio growth has a direct and immediate impact on earnings
