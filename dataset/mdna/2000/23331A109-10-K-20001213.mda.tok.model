safe harbor statement certain statements contained in this report  as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the securities and exchange commission  statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements made by company officials to analysts  stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about the company  may be construed as forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of any or all of the forward looking statements included in this report and in any other reports or public statements of the company may turn out to be inaccurate due to known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in and anticipated by the forward looking statements 
the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business includes factors we believe could adversely affect us 
other factors beyond those listed below could also adversely affect us 

general economic  real estate and other conditions the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  such as employment levels  availability of financing for home buyers  interest rates  consumer confidence and housing demand 
any oversupply of alternatives to new homes  such as rental properties and used homes  could depress new home prices and reduce our margins on the sale of new homes 
homebuilders are also subject to risks related to the availability and cost of land suitable for homebuilding  the availability and cost of materials and labor  adverse weather conditions which can cause delays in construction schedules and cost overruns 

increases in interest rates or decreases in mortgage availability virtually all of our customers finance their homes through lenders providing mortgage financing 
any future increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing could depress the market for new homes by making our homes less affordable 

governmental regulations and environmental matters we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect the development and homebuilding process  including zoning  density and building standards 
such regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities 
this can delay or increase the costs of development or homebuilding 
laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment can cause delays  increased costs of compliance and prohibitions or restrictions of development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive areas 

substantial debt we have a significant amount of debt 
the amount of our debt could limit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other requirements 
it could also limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or in general economic conditions 

competitive conditions the homebuilding industry is very competitive 
in each of the markets we serve  we compete with other homebuilders for home buyers  desirable properties  financing  raw materials and skilled labor 
competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry could result in difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices  the need for increased selling incentives  lower sales or delays in construction 

availability of capital our ability to grow our business and operations profitably is substantially dependent upon our ability to obtain capital from the sale of equity or debt or additional bank borrowings 
increases in interest rates  changes in our debt ratings by the national credit rating agencies  concerns by potential investors about the market or the economy  changing lending objectives of financial institutions  or further consolidation of financial institutions that lend to the homebuilding industry could increase our costs of borrowing or reduce the availability of funds necessary for us to achieve our strategic growth objectives 
moreover  the indentures for our outstanding debt contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future 

growth strategies since  we have acquired and successfully integrated many homebuilding companies 
in the future  we may acquire additional companies 
our prospects may be affected by our ability to successfully identify and integrate future acquisitions 
our prospects may also be affected by our ability to implement successfully our growth strategies in the markets we currently serve 

diversification efforts our prospects may be affected by the results of our investments in e commerce and technology initiatives related to homebuilding 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
however  any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on forms k  q and k should be consulted

the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable and fixed rate debt 
in addition  the company hedges its exposure to changes in interest rates on its variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to lock in a fixed interest rate for a portion of these borrowings 
finally  in order to maintain a more appropriate balance of variable and fixed rate debt  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement exchanging a fixed rate interest payment for a variable rate payment on a notional amount equal to the million principal amount of the senior notes due the variable payment for which the company is obligated is fixed through the senior notes first call date  april   and will ensure that the company will have received a net amount of million as of that date 
thereafter  the variable payment will be made through the senior notes s maturity  april   and will be based upon the day libor rate  plus 
in connection with the financial services segment  mortgage loans held for sale and the associated warehouse line are subject to interest rate risk 
the company uses forward commitments to manage this interest rate risk

accordingly  the company does not believe that the risks associated with this segment s financing activities are material
