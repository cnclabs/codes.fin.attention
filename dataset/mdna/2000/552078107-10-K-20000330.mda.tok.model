item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview general lyondell s and operating income includes the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business segment  consisting of the business acquired from arco chemical  prospectively from august  lyondell s activity in the petrochemicals  polymers and refining business segments is conducted through its interests in equistar and lcr 
the methanol business conducted through lmc is not a reportable segment for financial disclosure purposes 
lyondell accounts for its investments in equistar  lcr and lmc using the equity method of accounting 
lyondell s operating income includes eleven months of the petrochemicals and polymers business segments contributed to equistar on december  net income the net loss of million compares to net income of million in and million in all three years were affected by unusual items at lyondell as well as lyondell s share of unusual items at equistar and lcr as follows in millions net income loss add deduct extraordinary loss unusual items gain on asset sale adjusted net income loss the net loss for included a million extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt  an after tax  lifo related charge of million  lyondell s million after tax share of equistar restructuring and lcr renegotiated labor agreement charges  and lyondell s million after tax share of an equistar gain on asset sale 
earnings for included unusual charges of million after tax  related to the arco chemical acquisition  the renegotiated labor agreement at lcr and the formation of equistar  while net income for included unusual charges of million after tax  related to the formation of equistar 
the million decrease from adjusted net income of million in to the adjusted net loss of million in was primarily due to higher interest expense and lower equity income from lcr and  to a lesser extent  equistar 
the increase in interest expense reflected a full year of interest on debt related to the acquisition of arco chemical on july  this was only partly offset by the inclusion of a full year of operating income of the acquired business  which was included prospectively from august  lcr equity income decreased due to reduced allocations and a less favorable mix of extra heavy crude oil from pdvsa oil  lower margins on crude oil purchased on the spot market and production unit outages in equistar equity income decreased primarily due to lower polymers margins  which reflected higher raw material costs in the million decrease in adjusted net income to million in from million in was primarily due to lower income from the petrochemicals and polymers segments  due to lower product margins in  and higher interest expense on debt related to the arco chemical acquisition 
these factors more than offset increases in in operating income  resulting from the arco chemical acquisition  and in equity income from lcr 
results of operations lyondell chemical company revenues  operating costs and expenses lyondell s operating results for and include twelve months and five months  respectively  of the operating results of the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business segment 
this segment consists of the business acquired from arco chemical and is included prospectively from august  lyondell s operating income for includes eleven months of operating results of lyondell s petrochemicals and polymers segments  which were contributed to equistar on december   and the operating results of lmc  which was consolidated in unusual charges unusual charges  before tax  of million in increased versus million in primarily due to the write off of million of costs assigned to in process research and development in connection with the arco chemical acquisition 
income from equity investment in equistar lyondell s income from its equity investment in equistar was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease of million from to reflected lyondell s pretax share of equistar s restructuring and other unusual charges  which were million in compared to million in  as well as lower polymers margins  higher general and administrative expenses  and higher interest expense 
these were only partly offset by higher petrochemicals sales volumes and gains on asset sales 
equity income of million in represented one month of equistar activity 
income from equity investment in lcr lyondell s income from its equity investment in lcr was million in  million in and million in the decrease of million from to was primarily due to reduced allocations and a less favorable mix of extra heavy venezuelan crude oil under the crude supply agreement  lower margins on the sale of products refined from crude oil purchased in the spot market  and costs associated with production unit outages in the second quarter the increase in compared to reflected the benefits of the upgrade project at lcr  which resulted in higher average margins as greater volumes of extra heavy crude oil were processed in the coking mode 
the and periods included lyondell s share of pretax charges of million and million  respectively  associated with lcr s renegotiated labor agreement 
interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in interest expense in and compared to was primarily due to interest on debt related to the arco chemical acquisition on july  income tax the effective tax rate for  including the extraordinary item  was a benefit of compared to provisions of in and in lyondell s effective tax rate changed from to as a result of the federal income tax benefit from a domestic loss incurred in  which was partially offset by tax provisions in foreign jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate increased in compared to due to lyondell s inability  in  to claim foreign tax credits and limitations on the use of net operating losses for state tax purposes 
extraordinary item the extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt consisted of the write off of million  or million after tax  of unamortized debt issuance costs and amendment fees related to debt that was refinanced in may fourth quarter versus third quarter for the fourth quarter  lyondell reported a net loss of million  which included unusual after tax items of million as noted above 
the third quarter net loss of million included a million unfavorable adjustment of the income tax benefit 
excluding the unusual charges and the tax adjustment  lyondell s fourth quarter net loss of million compared to a net loss of million in the third quarter the decrease in profitability was primarily due to lower operating income and higher net interest expense  partly offset by higher equity income from equistar and lcr versus the third quarter 
the intermediate chemicals and derivatives segment had lower operating income as rising raw material costs reduced product margins for po and po derivatives 
this was partially offset by strong sales volumes for po based products 
higher equity income from equistar primarily reflected improved ethylene margins and increased sales volumes in the petrochemicals segment 
this was partially offset by a decline in polymers segment results as raw material prices rose more than product sales prices 
higher lcr equity income reflected lcr s million insurance recovery related to production unit outages in the second quarter of the year 
the increase in net interest expense compared to the third quarter is due to a combination of lower interest income  higher amortization of debt issuance costs as well as higher interest rates on variable rate debt 
intermediate chemicals and derivatives segment the following is a discussion of historical operating results for the year ended december  and of the operating results for the years ended december  and included in the unaudited pro forma combined historical results of lyondell and arco chemical see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the unaudited pro forma combined historical results give effect to the acquisition of arco chemical 
volumes  in millions a a po  po derivatives  isocyanates pounds    co products styrene monomer pounds    tba and derivatives gallons   millions of dollars sales and other operating revenues    unusual charges operating income a volumes and financial data are pro forma for the years ended december  and revenues actual revenues increased compared to pro forma revenues on higher volumes partly offset by lower average sales prices 
po  po derivatives and isocyanates volumes increased compared to driven by us economic growth  particularly in the automotive  housing and construction sectors  and continued improvements in asian economies 
asia accounts for about of lyondell s total po sales volumes 
styrene monomer volumes increased primarily due to higher exports to europe and asia as well as higher contractual amounts under long term sm processing arrangements 
tba and derivatives volumes increased due to higher global demand for mtbe 
average sales prices decreased in for po  po derivatives and isocyanates  despite higher average raw material costs 
the decrease reflects heightened competition in the po industry as a result of significant new po capacity coming on stream in late and early european sales prices were also negatively affected by the foreign exchange effect of a stronger us dollar 
pro forma revenues decreased compared to pro forma revenues 
the decrease was primarily due to lower average sales prices in  reflecting a combination of downward pressure from lower feedstock costs  ongoing competition in po derivatives and isocyanates markets  the negative effects of a stronger us dollar on foreign sales  and the effects of weaker asian markets 
po  po derivatives and isocyanates volumes were essentially flat versus as stronger demand for certain po derivatives in the us and europe was offset by lower volumes in asian markets 
increased sm volumes in primarily reflect higher contractual amounts under long term sm processing arrangements 
tba and derivatives volumes decreased in  mainly due to lower mtbe demand 
unusual charges the period included pro forma net unusual charges of million  consisting of million related to the write off of in process research and development projects in connection with the arco chemical acquisition  million of lyondell severance costs  and a million reversal by arco chemical of its restructuring accrual 
the period included pro forma unusual charges of million  consisting of million of arco chemical restructuring and other costs and million of lyondell severance costs 
operating income excluding unusual charges  actual operating income of million decreased million or compared to pro forma operating income of million in operating income in was negatively affected by a million lifo related charge due to a reduction of inventory levels as part of lyondell s efforts to reduce working capital 
the lifo inventory valuation reflects the fair market value assigned to inventory as part of the arco chemical acquisition 
additionally  product margins decreased on lower sales prices and higher raw material costs 
the decrease in product margins was partly offset by a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  reflecting benefits of cost reduction efforts and a million reduction of estimated liabilities related to the arco chemical acquisition 
excluding unusual charges  pro forma operating income of million in increased million compared to million in the improved operating income was primarily due to higher product margins and lower fixed costs 
product margins for po  po derivatives and isocyanates  as a group  improved as raw material costs decreased more than sales prices 
the fixed cost decrease reflected the benefits of the cost reduction program and lower maintenance expense 
fourth quarter versus third quarter operating income in the fourth quarter decreased to million from million in the third quarter the decrease primarily reflected the million lifo related charge and lower overall product margins 
the benefit from higher volumes for po  po derivatives and isocyanates was offset by lower co product volumes 
a rapid rise in raw material costs  primarily propylene  put pressure on margins for many po derivatives 
price increase initiatives were generally unsuccessful in keeping pace with rising propylene costs 
the margin decreases for po based products were partly offset by higher co product margins 
mtbe margins increased as prices rose strongly during the quarter with rises in crude oil and gasoline prices  partially offset by higher butane costs  a key mtbe raw material 
sm margins increased about compared to the third quarter as prices rose more than raw material costs on stronger global demand 
overall po  po derivatives and isocyanates volumes increased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter  as higher propylene glycol sales  driven by seasonally higher sales of aircraft deicers  and higher polyols sales more than offset lower merchant po sales volumes 
po merchant volumes were adversely affected by the start up of new industry po capacity in europe 
the fourth quarter saw a seasonal decline of in mtbe sales volumes compared to the third quarter 
styrene monomer volumes decreased primarily due to the timing of december shipments and lower volumes of sales to equity partners as a result of an unplanned production unit outage 
equistar chemicals  lp selected pricing information the following graphs present selected industry pricing information for the periods shown 
chart month end average spot price wts low prices for crude oil as reported by platts oilgram price report from january through december chart indicates decreasing prices in with an annual average of the month end prices of per barrel 
prices declined steadily in with a low point of per barrel in december and an annual average of the month end prices of per barrel 
prices rose rapidly in  peaking at per barrel in december with an annual average of per barrel 
selected month end prices are as follows january per barrel  december per barrel  december per barrel  december per barrel 
chart month end average net transaction contract prices for ethlylene as reported by cmai monomers market report from january through december chart indicates prices were relatively flat for the first six months and slightly decreasing in the latter half of the year with an annual average of the month end prices of cents per pound 
prices declined steadily with an annual average of the month end prices of cents per pound 
prices rose rapidly in  peaking at cents per pound in december with an annual average of the month end prices of cents per pound 
selected month end prices are as follows january cents per pound  december cents per pound  december cents per pound  december cents per pound 
overview the following tables present selected financial and operating information for equistar for the years ended december  and  and for the combined businesses for the year ended december  the combined businesses consist of the lyondell contributed business and the millennium contributed business for the eleven months ended november  and equistar for the one month ended december  for comparative purposes  income taxes are excluded from the combined data  since equistar  as a partnership  is not subject to federal income tax 
these combined results for the year ended december  are not intended to  and do not  represent pro forma results of equistar 
the combined data in these tables do not necessarily reflect the results of operations of equistar that would have resulted had the businesses been combined as of january  the operating results of the business contributed by occidental chemical corporation are included prospectively from may  equistar combined millions of dollars sales and other operating revenues    cost of sales    other operating expenses restructuring and other unusual charges operating income interest expense  net other income  net net income net income equistar s net income of million in decreased million from net income of million in the decrease was attributable to restructuring and other unusual charges  which were million in compared to million in  as well as lower polymers margins  higher general and administrative expenses  and higher interest expense in compared with these were only partly offset by higher petrochemicals sales volumes and gains on asset sales 
equistar s net income of million in decreased million from combined net income of million in the decrease was primarily due to lower prices and margins in both the petrochemicals and polymers segments 
the decline in prices and margins began in the fourth quarter and continued throughout the decline was partially offset by increased sales volumes  primarily as a result of the addition of the occidental contributed business in mid may fourth quarter compared to third quarter equistar reported a net loss of million in the fourth quarter excluding million of restructuring and other unusual charges  equistar had net income of million compared to net income of million in the third quarter operating results improved compared to the third quarter as higher petrochemicals margins were only partly offset by lower polymers margins and higher general and administrative expenses 
compared to the third quarter  petrochemicals margins increased as higher selling prices for ethylene  propylene and other co products more than offset higher raw material costs 
polymers margins decreased as increases in polymers sales prices did not keep pace with increases in the cost of raw materials  primarily ethylene and propylene 
the million of restructuring and other unusual charges in the fourth quarter related to decisions to shut down polymer reactors at two sites and to consolidate administrative functions between lyondell and equistar  resulting in the write down of the related asset values and the incurrence of employee severance costs 
segment data the following tables reflect selected actual and combined sales volume data  including intersegment sales volumes  and summarized financial information for equistar s business segments 
the addition of the occidental contributed business is reflected prospectively from may  equistar combined in millions selected petrochemicals products olefins pounds    aromatics gallons polymers products pounds    millions of dollars sales and other operating revenues petrochemicals segment    polymers segment    intersegment eliminations    total    cost of sales petrochemicals segment    polymers segment    intersegment eliminations    total    other operating expenses petrochemicals segment polymers segment unallocated total operating income petrochemicals segment polymers segment unallocated total petrochemicals segment revenues revenues of billion in increased from billion in the increase was due to both higher average sales prices and higher sales volumes during as a result of rapidly rising prices throughout  which reflected stronger demand as well as increases in the underlying cost of raw materials  average sales prices for were about higher than average sales prices for sales volumes increased about during  reflecting a full year of the occidental contributed business 
revenues of billion in decreased from combined sales revenues of billion in the decrease was due to significantly lower sales prices  partly offset by higher sales volumes 
average sales prices in were approximately lower than average sales prices primarily due to increased industry capacity and downward pressure on sales prices as a result of the lower cost of raw materials 
sales volumes increased about primarily as a result of the addition of the occidental contributed business in mid may operating income operating income of million in increased compared to million in  while gross margin as a percent of sales was flat 
the benefit from increased sales volumes was only partly offset by the effects of production unit outages in during  one of equistar s two channelview olefins units  with an annual ethylene capacity of billion pounds  was shut down from april  to may  to repair a compressor 
gross margin percentages were flat as higher sales prices kept pace with higher raw material costs 
the increase in sales volumes was primarily due to inclusion of a full year of operations of the occidental contributed business  which was added in mid may operating income of million in decreased from a combined million in  while gross margin as a of sales decreased to in from in the decrease in operating income primarily reflected lower margins partly offset by higher sales volumes 
the lower margins were due to lower sales prices  which decreased more than raw material costs  and slightly higher fixed costs 
the increased sales volumes primarily resulted from the addition of the occidental contributed business 
polymers segment revenues revenues of billion in decreased slightly compared to revenues of billion in primarily due to lower sales volumes 
sales volumes declined due to the shut down of less efficient hdpe and other polymer product capacity  plant maintenance and the sale of the concentrates and compounds business in industry sales prices began decreasing during the fourth quarter  continued in a downward trend throughout  and increased rapidly during as raw material costs increased 
revenues of billion in decreased from a combined billion in the decrease was primarily the result of decreases in industry sales prices due to excess industry supply and lower raw material costs  partly offset by higher sales volumes 
operating income operating income of million for decreased compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to substantially lower margins in compared to as raw material cost increases outpaced sales price increases 
gross margin as a percent of sales decreased to in from in  reflecting the lower product margins 
operating income of million in decreased from a combined million in the decrease was a result of lower product margins in polymer sales prices decreased throughout  but were partially offset by lower raw material costs 
gross margin as a percent of sales decreased to in from in unallocated the following discusses expenses that were not allocated to the petrochemicals and polymers segments 
other operating expenses this caption includes selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expense  and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
unallocated expenses were million in  million in and a combined million in the increase from to is offset by decreases in the expenses allocated to the segments 
the increase from to was primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefit expenses and costs associated with year preventive measures 
restructuring and other unusual charges restructuring and other unusual charges were million in  million in  and a combined million in during the fourth quarter  equistar recorded a pretax charge of million associated with a decision to shut down certain polymer reactors and severance costs related to these shutdowns and consolidation of certain administrative functions between lyondell and equistar 
in line with the company s strategy to invest only in businesses that have the potential to be in the top quartile of profit margin performance  the decision to shut down the polymer reactors was based on their high production cost  current market conditions in the polyethylene industry and equistar s flexibility to utilize more efficient reactors to meet customer requirements 
approximately million of the total charge is an adjustment of the asset carrying values of the reactors 
the remaining million represents severance and other employee related costs for approximately employee positions that are being eliminated 
equistar expects that the severance payments will be made in the eliminated positions  primarily administrative functions  resulted from opportunities to share such services between lyondell and equistar and  to a lesser extent  positions associated with the shut down polymer reactors 
equistar incurred restructuring charges related to the initial merger and integration of the businesses contributed by lyondell and millennium upon the formation of equistar and with the addition of the occidental contributed business 
equistar recorded million of restructuring charges in december and million in interest expense  net and other income  net net interest expense was million in  million in and a combined million in interest expense increased from to and due to higher levels of debt as a result of the addition of the occidental contributed business in mid may interest expense also increased from to due to the february refinancing of million of bank debt with senior unsecured notes  which carried a higher fixed rate of interest 
other income of million in primarily consisted of net gains on asset sales  including the sale of the concentrates and compounds business in april lyondell citgo refining lp refining segment the following table sets forth  in thousands of barrels per day  sales volumes for lcr s refined products and processing rates at the refinery for the periods indicated for the year ended december refined products sales volumes gasoline diesel and heating oil jet fuel aromatics other refined products total refined products volumes crude processing rates crude supply agreement coked other heavy crude oil coked other crude oil total crude processing rates revenues revenues for lcr  including intersegment sales  were billion in  billion in and billion in the increase in compared to is due to higher prices partly offset by lower volumes 
prices of refined products increased in as crude oil prices escalated 
the lower sales volumes and processing rates in primarily reflect lower allocations and deliveries of extra heavy venezuelan crude oil by pdvsa oil and  to a lesser extent  the effect of second quarter production unit outages 
the decrease in revenues in versus primarily resulted from lower refined products prices  which declined as a result of lower crude oil prices 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales volumes as production levels increased  reflecting a full year s benefit from the upgrade project 
operating income lcr s operating income was million in  million in and million in the decrease in from primarily reflected reduced processing of extra heavy crude oil as a result of lower allocations and deliveries and a less favorable mix of extra heavy venezuelan crude oil received from pdvsa oil  partially offset by increased processing of spot crude 
margins on the crude oil purchased in the spot market were also lower compared to the operating results were also negatively affected by costs and lower operating rates related to outages of a coker unit and a fluid catalytic cracker unit during the second quarter the and periods included pretax charges of million and million  respectively  associated with lcr s renegotiated labor agreement 
the increase in versus reflected the benefits of the upgrade project  which resulted in higher average margins as higher volumes of extra heavy crude oil were processed in the coking mode 
the upgrade project was completed in the first quarter and  initially  higher costs were incurred due to normal operational start up activities  during which the refinery did not operate at peak rates 
cost savings resulting from improved operational efficiency in were partly offset by higher depreciation expense attributable to the upgrade project 
interest expense lcr s net interest expense was million in  million in  and million in interest expense on debt related to the upgrade project was capitalized through its completion  including the first quarter of fourth quarter versus third quarter lcr had pretax income of million in the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter the increase in earnings was due to a million insurance recovery partly offset by a million unusual charge related to the renegotiated labor agreement 
the insurance recovery related to the second quarter production unit outages 
improvement in lubes and aromatics margins was offset by lower processing rates of extra heavy crude oil under the crude supply agreement with pdvsa oil 
lcr s total crude oil processing rates averaged  barrels per day in the fourth quarter  compared to  barrels per day in the third quarter the increase in total rates was due to higher volumes of crude oil purchased in the spot market 
financial condition operating activities lyondell s cash provided by operating activities totaled million in compared to million in operating cash flow was negatively affected in both and by an increase in working capital 
the increase was primarily due to a million increase in receivables 
receivables increased due to an million decrease in the amount of receivables sold in versus under a receivables purchase agreement and a increase in fourth quarter sales over fourth quarter the fourth quarter sales increase reflected higher volumes as well as higher co product prices 
operating cash flow in benefited from customer advances and tax refunds received 
higher working capital in the period reflected the payment of accounts payable retained by lyondell after the december formation of equistar 
investing activities lyondell s capital expenditures were million in  while joint venture capital expenditures were million for equistar  million for lcr and million for lmc 
lyondell s pro rata share of the joint ventures capital expenditures was million for a total of million 
this compares to million in  which included only five months of the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business 
the capital budget is million  consisting of million for lyondell and million for lyondell s pro rata share of the joint ventures budgeted capital expenditures 
distributions from affiliates in excess of their earnings for were million  including million from equistar and million from lcr 
lyondell loaned million to lcr for capital  maintenance and environmental projects in and contributed million to lmc to fund first quarter turnaround expenditures and working capital requirements 
additionally  lyondell converted million of its note receivable from lcr to an equity investment in lcr effective december  financing activities in may  lyondell amended its billion credit facility  which was put in place in july primarily to fund the arco chemical acquisition 
the credit facility amendments provided the lenders with additional collateral  re priced the existing loans to reflect then market rates and revised certain financial covenants 
also in may  lyondell issued million shares of common stock  receiving net proceeds of million 
lyondell also issued million of senior subordinated notes due  billion of senior secured notes due  and million of senior secured notes due lyondell borrowed additional amounts under the amended credit facility through its new million  seven year term loan e and new million term loan f  maturing december  term loan e bears interest at libor plus  and term loan f bears interest at libor plus 
lyondell used the proceeds to retire the billion principal amount of term loan c  maturing june   and the billion principal amount of term loan d  maturing june   and to partially repay principal amounts outstanding under term loans a and b under the credit facility maturing june  and june   respectively 
unamortized debt issuance costs and amendment fees of million after tax were written off and reported as an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt in lyondell paid regular quarterly dividends of 
per share of common stock in for a total of million 
in february  equistar completed an offering of senior unsecured notes in the principal amount of million 
the proceeds were primarily used to refinance existing indebtedness of equistar 
liquidity and capital resources at december   lyondell had cash on hand of million and million available under its revolving credit facility that extends until july current maturities of long term debt were million 
lyondell expects that net proceeds of approximately billion from the sale of assets to bayer will be used to reduce lyondell s variable rate bank debt of billion outstanding at december  this reduction in debt will strengthen lyondell s balance sheet and reduce interest expense 
aggregate maturities of long term debt  without giving effect to the proposed asset sale and debt retirement  are million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in and billion thereafter 
the amended credit facility and the indentures under which the senior secured notes and the senior subordinated notes were issued contain covenants relating to liens  sale and leaseback transactions  debt incurrence  leverage and interest coverage ratios  dividends and investments  sales of assets and mergers and consolidations 
lyondell was in compliance with all such covenants as of december   however  given the poor current business environment in the petrochemicals industry  lyondell secured an amendment to certain financial covenants in february that will increase its financial and operating flexibility in the near term 
additionally  the amendment eliminated a cross default provision in the credit facility that could have been triggered by a default on lcr s million construction facility  which is discussed below 
lcr has million outstanding under a five year construction facility  which expires in may lyondell and citgo  as partners of lcr  have agreed to pursue a refinancing of the indebtedness  although the final terms have not been determined 
because a bank commitment has not yet been received  the independent accountants of lcr have stated in their audit report that the lack of such a commitment or new agreement raises substantial doubts concerning lcr s ability to continue as a going concern 
however  management expects that lcr will be able to refinance or repay the indebtedness 
in addition  as an interim measure  lcr may seek to extend the maturity date of the existing indebtedness 
equistar had outstanding debt of billion at december  lyondell remains liable on approximately million of equistar debt for which equistar assumed primary responsibility in connection with its formation 
at december   equistar  lcr and lmc had combined outstanding debt of billion and combined equity of approximately billion 
the ability of the joint ventures to distribute cash to lyondell is reduced by their respective debt service obligations 
furthermore  a default under equistar s debt instruments involving more than million of indebtedness would constitute a cross default under lyondell s credit facility 
lyondell believes that conditions will be such that cash balances  cash generated from operating activities and the bayer transaction discussed below  and funds from lines of credit will be adequate to meet anticipated future cash requirements for scheduled debt repayments  necessary capital expenditures and dividends 
recent developments in november  lyondell reached a definitive agreement to sell its worldwide polyols business to bayer for billion 
bayer will also receive an ownership interest in certain of lyondell s us po operations through formation of a joint venture to produce po 
the lyondell board of directors and the supervisory board of bayer have approved the agreement  and the companies have received regulatory clearance in europe and the united states 
lyondell expects that the transaction will close on or about april  in addition  as part of the transaction  lyondell and bayer agreed to pursue a joint venture for the construction of po  a previously announced worldscale propylene oxide styrene monomer plant in europe 
the following summary balance sheet and income statement present the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial position of lyondell as of december  and the pro forma consolidated operating results for the year then ended as if the bayer transaction had occurred on december  for balance sheet purposes and as of january  for income statement purposes 
the pro forma financial statements assume that net proceeds of billion were used to retire debt in accordance with the provisions of lyondell s credit facility and debt covenants 
pro forma millions of dollars balance sheet total current assets  property  plant and equipment  net  investments and long term receivables  goodwill  net  deferred charges and other assets total assets  current maturities of long term debt other current liabilities  long term debt  less current maturities  other liabilities and deferred credits deferred income taxes minority interest stockholders equity  total liabilities and stockholders equity  statement of income sales and other operating revenues  operating income income from equity investments interest expense  net net loss from continuing operations basic and diluted loss per share from continuing operations 
the unaudited pro forma data presented above are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations of lyondell that would have occurred had such transactions actually been consummated as of the indicated dates nor are they necessarily indicative of future results 
the pro forma financial statements also make certain assumptions regarding the final agreements related to the transaction  some of which have not been concluded to date 
the final agreements could yield data that differ from the financial information presented above 
however  such changes are not expected to be material 
current business outlook in the near term  lyondell expects continued stable volume growth for the intermediate chemicals and derivatives segment  as demand growth  aided by a strong recovery in asia  absorbs new industry po capacity 
however  the new capacity will continue to put pressure on prices and margins 
strong demand for products in the petrochemicals and polymers segments continues to benefit equistar s operations 
a resurgence of raw material cost increases early in has negatively affected product margins in all three business segments 
meanwhile  both lyondell and equistar are taking aggressive actions to further reduce costs and increase cash flow 
reduced allocations of extra heavy venezuelan crude oil to lcr are ongoing and are expected to continue to negatively impact lcr s operating results 
however  some relief is anticipated in the second quarter when opec is expected to increase production quotas 
over the longer term  lyondell expects continued consolidation in the chemical industry  creating fewer but stronger competitors 
industry forecasts project a continuing difficult business environment due to industry capacity additions  primarily in the petrochemicals and polymers segments 
this new capacity is expected to put pressure on product margins beginning in late until demand growth absorbs the new capacity 
lyondell has participated in the consolidation trend in the industry with the formation of equistar and the subsequent acquisition of arco chemical 
management s current priority is to pay down the acquisition related debt  and thus improve lyondell s financial flexibility 
to accomplish this  it will focus on actively managing its current portfolio of assets and maximizing earnings and cash flow 
while lyondell does not control raw material costs or general market conditions  management plans to maximize earnings and cash flow by focusing on the things that it can directly influence such as continuing to reduce working capital  achieving cost reductions and employing a disciplined capital program 
year lyondell did not experience any disruptions of its operations as a result of either internal or third party year problems 
year spending by lyondell  equistar and lcr for the replacement of both business and manufacturing systems is summarized as follows millions of dollars lyondell equistar lcr total spending lyondell share of spending spending for all three organizations totaled million  of which lyondell s share was million 
spending was funded by cash generated from operations 
approximately of the total spending by all three organizations qualified for capitalization 
european monetary union on january   the euro became the official currency for the eleven member countries of the european union austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal and spain that are participating in monetary union 
on that date  the national currencies of the participating countries ceased to exist as independent currencies and continued only as denominations of the euro 
the euro conversion rates for each of the former national currencies were irrevocably fixed on january  euro banknotes and coins will be introduced on january  and the former national currency banknotes and coins will be withdrawn by july  at the latest 
while lyondell converted its systems to invoice customers in euros beginning january   due to year and other priorities  the conversion of other business and financial systems did not begin until the first quarter of it is anticipated that the conversion of most of these other business and financial systems to the euro will be completed by january   the deadline for system conversion 
based upon the assessments completed to date  european monetary union has not had  and is not expected to have  a material impact on lyondell s consolidated financial statements 
lyondell s european based revenues are approximately billion on an annual basis 
environmental matters various environmental laws and regulations impose substantial requirements upon the operations of lyondell 
lyondell s policy is to be in compliance with such laws and regulations  which include  among others  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla as amended  rcra and the clean air act amendments 
lyondell does not specifically track all recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution in ongoing operations 
such costs are included in cost of sales 
lyondell  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures also make capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations 
such capital expenditures totaled  in the aggregate  approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
lyondell estimates that such capital expenditures will total approximately million in all such expenditures are funded by cash generated from operations 
the eight county houston galveston region has been designated a severe non attainment area for ozone by the epa 
this could result in increased capital investment and higher operating costs for equistar  lyondell  and lcr during the next several years 
additionally  the clean air act specified certain emissions standards for vehicles beginning in the model year and required the epa to study whether further emissions reduction standards for vehicles were necessary 
these new standards were finalized in and will require refiners to produce a low sulfur gasoline by with some allowances for a conditional phase in period that could extend final compliance until this rule could result in increased capital investment and higher operating costs for lcr 
equistar s olefins fuel business may also be impacted 
lyondell is also subject to certain assessment and remedial actions at its own plant sites under rcra and at cercla sites 
the liability under rcra and various state and foreign government regulations primarily relates to the lcr refinery  six current lyondell plant sites and two former plant sites 
under cercla  the liability primarily relates to three federal sites 
lyondell is also involved in administrative proceedings or lawsuits relating to a minimal number of other cercla sites 
lyondell estimates  based upon currently available information  that potential loss contingencies associated with the latter cercla sites  individually and in the aggregate  are not significant 
in addition  lyondell has negotiated an order with the tnrcc for assessment and remediation of groundwater and soil contamination at the lcr refinery 
as of december   lyondell s environmental liability for future assessment and remediation costs at the above mentioned sites totaled million 
the liabilities per site range from less than million to million and are expected to be incurred over the next two to seven years 
lyondell spent million  million and million in  and  respectively  relating to environmental remediation matters 
lyondell estimates that expenditures will total approximately million in in the opinion of management  there is currently no material range of loss in excess of the amount recorded for these sites 
however  it is possible that new information about the sites for which the accrual has been established  new technology or future developments such as involvement in other cercla  rcra  tnrcc or other comparable state or foreign law investigations  could require lyondell to reassess its potential exposure related to environmental matters 
accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
subsequently  the fasb delayed the effective date by one year 
the statement is effective for the company s calendar year with early adoption permitted 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending upon whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
the gains and losses on the derivative instrument that are reported in other comprehensive income will be reclassified as earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the hedged item 
the ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in current period earnings 
lyondell  equistar and lcr are currently evaluating the effect sfas no 
implementation will have on their financial statements 
forward looking statements certain of the statements contained in this report  including those set forth in item business and properties  this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as well as those set forth in item a 
disclosure of market risk  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
although lyondell believes the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  they do involve certain assumptions  risks and uncertainties  and lyondell can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
lyondell s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries  uncertainties associated with the united states and worldwide economies  current and potential governmental regulatory actions in the united states and in other countries  substantial chemical and refinery capacity additions resulting in oversupply and declining prices and margins  raw material costs or supply arrangements  lyondell s ability to implement cost reductions  and operating interruptions including leaks  explosions  fires  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  labor difficulties  transportation interruptions  spills and releases and other environmental risks 
many of such factors are beyond lyondell s or its joint ventures ability to control or predict 
management cautions against putting undue reliance on forward looking statements or projecting any future results based on such statements or present or prior earnings levels 
all forward looking statements in this form k are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this section and elsewhere in this report 
item a 
disclosure of market risk commodity price risk a substantial portion of lyondell s products and feedstocks  as well as those of equistar  lcr and lyondell methanol  are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply demand fundamentals change 
accordingly  product margins and the level of lyondell s profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle 
lyondell tries to protect against such instability through various business strategies 
these include increasing the olefins plants feedstock flexibility  entering into multi year processing and sales agreements  moving downstream into derivatives products whose pricing is more stable  and the use of the deemed margin contract at lcr 
lyondell has not used derivative instruments for commodity price hedging purposes 
during  equistar entered into over the counter derivatives and price collar agreements for crude oil to help manage its exposure to commodity price risk with respect to crude oil related raw material purchases 
as of december   the outstanding over the counter derivatives and collar agreements covered million and million barrels  respectively  matured in january  and covered approximately half of equistar s crude oil related raw material requirements for that period 
equistar does not engage in any derivatives trading activities 
assuming a hypothetical decrease in crude oil prices from those in effect at year end  the loss in earnings for the combined derivatives contracts would not be significant 
sensitivity analysis was used for this purpose 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account the effects of the underlying operating transactions 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange exposures result from cash flows between us and foreign operations and transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a foreign operating entity 
lyondell uses foreign currency swap and forward contracts to minimize the exposure related to net monetary exposures on the balance sheet and anticipatory cash flows 
although lyondell uses these types of contracts to reduce foreign exchange exposures with respect to revenues  capital commitments and other expenses denominated in foreign currencies  there can be no assurance that such hedging techniques will protect lyondell s reported results against exchange rate fluctuations or that lyondell will not incur material losses on such contracts 
at december   lyondell had foreign currency contracts outstanding in the notional amount of million  principally swap contracts hedging the netherlands guilder 
at december   lyondell had one forward contract outstanding in the notional amount of million  hedging the euro 
assuming a hypothetical unfavorable change in the euro exchange rate from that in effect at year end  the increase in foreign exchange loss on this contract was not material 
sensitivity analysis was used for this purpose 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account the effects of the underlying operating transactions 
interest rate risk lyondell is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to variable rate debt 
in may  lyondell issued million shares of common stock  receiving net proceeds of million 
lyondell also issued billion of fixed rate debt 
lyondell used the proceeds to reduce variable rate debt from billion outstanding at december  to billion outstanding at december   thereby reducing its exposure to interest rate risk 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates from those in effect at year end  the increase in annual interest expense on the variable rate debt would be approximately million 
sensitivity analysis was used for the purpose of this analysis 
lyondell expects to receive net proceeds of billion from the sale of assets to bayer in the first half of  which will be used to further reduce its variable rate bank debt 
at december   lyondell had treasury rate lock contracts outstanding in the notional amount of billion 
these were entered into during to mitigate interest rate exposure on lyondell s anticipated future public debt issuance 
as a result of the may refinancing  lyondell settled the treasury rate locks during the second quarter in the amount of million 
this amount is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt 
at december  equistar and lcr had variable rate debt of million and million  respectively  excluding the note payable by lcr to lyondell 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates from those in effect at year end  lyondell s share of the increase in annual interest expense on the variable rate debt would not be material 
regulatory risk certain federal and state governmental initiatives in the us have sought either to rescind the oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline or to restrict or ban the use of mtbe 
lyondell does not expect the recent proposals to have a significant impact on mtbe margins and volumes in the near term 
in europe  mtbe demand is benefiting from new legislation in the nation european union  which may offset any potential decline in the us should it become necessary to reduce mtbe production over the longer term  lyondell would need to make capital expenditures to convert its mtbe plants to production of alternate gasoline blending components 
the profit margins on such alternate gasoline blending components could differ from those historically realized on mtbe
