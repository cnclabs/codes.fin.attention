item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of proprietary platform technologies and therapeutic products based on gene regulation and signal transduction 
our core competencies in functional genomics  protein engineering and structure based drug design allow us to capitalize on the wealth of genetic information being generated by government  academic and commercial laboratories 
we apply this expertise to the development of proprietary technology platforms that allow manipulation of signal transduction  gene transcription  and protein secretion events using small molecule drugs 
we believe that our ability to control the activity of genes and proteins allows us to broadly apply discoveries in genomics to the development of innovative therapeutic products 
aventis relationship from november through december  substantially all of our research revenue and the majority of our research expenses were incurred in collaboration or in partnership with aventis pharmaceuticals inc  formerly known as hoechst marion roussel  inc  and its affiliates 
in november  we entered into an agreement with hoechst marion roussel  sa to collaborate on the discovery and development of drugs to treat osteoporosis and related bone diseases  one of our signal transduction inhibitor programs 
in march  we entered into an agreement  which established a joint venture  called the hoechst ariad genomics center  llc  or the genomics center  with aventis to pursue functional genomics with the goal of identifying genes that encode novel therapeutic proteins and small molecule drug targets 
we recognized aggregate revenue under these agreements of  in   in and  in on december   we completed the sale of our interest in the genomics center to aventis and received  in cash   shares our series b preferred stock  the forgiveness of  of long term debt we owed to aventis  drug candidates and related technologies resulting from the osteoporosis agreement and the right to use certain genomics and bioinformatics technologies developed by the genomics center 
we recorded a net gain on the sale of  as a result of this sale  the revenue generated in our relationship with aventis will not recur  and we expect to realize a reduction of revenue in fiscal of at least  which will be offset by an expected reduction in research and development expenses associated with the genomics center of approximately  general since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
we receive no revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products  and substantially all revenue to date has been received in connection with our relationship with aventis 
except for the gain on the sale of the genomics center in december  which resulted in net income for fiscal  we have not been profitable since inception 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to the expansion of our research and development programs and manufacturing and clinical development 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  after including a one time gain of  on the sale of our interest in the genomics center on december  results of operations years ended december   and revenue we recognized research revenue under our services agreements  collaborative research arrangements and government sponsored grants of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of  or in compared to was due to an increase of  in research revenue recognized under our services agreements with the genomics center and the achievement of the second milestone of  under the hmr osteoporosis agreement  partially offset by a reduction of  in the amortization of deferred revenue recognized in the prior year relating to the osteoporosis agreement and a decrease of  in government sponsored research grant revenue recognized in the prior year 
the increase of  or in compared to was due to an increase of  in research revenue recognized under our services agreements with the genomics center  partially offset by a  decrease in research revenue recognized under the hmr osteoporosis agreement and government sponsored research grants 
we expect research revenue to decrease over the next year resulting from the termination of our services agreement with the genomics center and the termination of the osteoporosis agreement as a result of the sale of our ownership interest in the genomics center 
as of january   we have no research arrangements or government sponsored grants that will generate revenue in interest income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income decreased by  in compared to as a result of a lower level of funds invested and a realized loss on the sale of marketable securities of  recorded in interest income decreased by  in compared to as a result of a lower level of invested funds 
operating expenses research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses decreased by  or due primarily to decreased manufacturing development and other preclinical development costs incurred in  partially offset by increased research services provided to the genomics center under our services agreements in research and development expenses increased by  or in compared to primarily due to increases in research services provided to the genomics center under our services agreements and increased product development costs for our regulated gene therapy product candidates  including manufacturing  process development and other preclinical development activities in preparation for clinical trials of ap that commenced in december ap is the small molecule drug used in our gvhd cell therapy product candidate 
we expect our research and development expenses to decrease over the next year as a result of the sale of our ownership interest in the genomics center 
general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or in compared to primarily due to increased professional and legal services incurred in connection with litigation  as well as a proposed private placement offering that was not undertaken 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or in compared to primarily due to nonrecurrence in of administrative expenses incurred in connection with the formation of the genomics center in we incurred interest expense of  in compared to  in and  in the increase of  in compared to was due to the amortization of financing costs relating to the issuance of series c preferred stock in  offset by a reduction in the level of debt outstanding 
the increase of  in compared to was due to the issuance of debt at the end of the second quarter in accounting change we adopted statement of position  or sop  reporting the cost of start up activities  effective january  and recorded a charge of  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
operating results we reported income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of  in and incurred losses of  in and  in after such cumulative effect  we reported net income of  for our results for include a gain on the sale of our interest in the genomics center of  we expect that substantial operating losses will be reported for several more years  but are expected to decrease over the next year as a result of the sale of our interest in the genomics center 
however  operating losses are expected to subsequently increase as our product development activities expand and will fluctuate as a result of differences in the timing and composition of revenue earned and expenses incurred 
on december  and january   we repurchased and retired all of our series c preferred stock and recorded a charge of  in representing the premium paid on the repurchase  which has been deducted from net income in determining net income attributable to common stockholders 
accretion costs attributable to the series c preferred stock of  and  were also recognized in and  respectively 
we reported net income attributable to common stockholders of  in or 
per share basic and 
per share diluted 
we reported net losses attributable to common stockholders of  in and  in or and 
per share basic  respectively 
at december   we had available for federal tax reporting purposes and net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  that expire commencing in we also had federal research and development tax credit carryovers of approximately  that expire commencing in the utilization of both the net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits is subject to certain limitations under federal tax laws 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and investments primarily through the private placement and public offering of our securities  including the sale of series c preferred stock to investors and the sale of series b preferred stock to aventis pharmaceuticals inc  supplemented by the issuance of long term debt  operating and capital lease transactions  interest income  government sponsored research grants  research revenue under the osteoporosis agreement  research revenue under the terms of our services agreements with the genomics center  and  in december  the sale to aventis of our interest in the genomics center 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  exclusive of  of cash  subsequently expended on january   to repurchase the remaining series c preferred stock  and working capital of  compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  and working capital of  at december the primary uses of cash during the year ended december  were  to finance our operations and working capital requirements   to purchase laboratory equipment   to repay long term debt   for the repurchase and retirement of series c preferred stock and  to acquire intellectual property 
the primary sources of funds during the year ended december  were  of research revenue from aventis under our services agreements   of research funding from the osteoporosis agreement  including  received upon the achievement of the second research milestone under this agreement   from the net return of investment in the genomics center   from the sale leaseback of laboratory equipment   of proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable securities   from the sale of series b preferred stock to aventis   of borrowings from aventis  and  from the sale of our ownership interest in the genomics center to aventis 
we have substantial fixed commitments under various research and licensing agreements  consulting and employment agreements  lease agreements and long term debt instruments 
these fixed commitments currently aggregate in excess of  per year and may increase 
we will require substantial additional funding for our research and development programs  including preclinical development and clinical trials  for operating expenses  for the pursuit of regulatory clearances and for establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
adequate funds for these purposes  whether obtained through financial markets or collaborative or other arrangements with collaborative partners  or from other sources  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
we have issued  publicly traded warrants  each of which entitles its holder to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants expire on december  as of march    warrants have been exercised for an aggregate exercise price of  and  warrants remain outstanding 
if all of the remaining outstanding warrants are exercised  we would receive proceeds of  on march   we issued a call notice for the redemption of the warrants 
if the market price of our common stock continues to trade at a per share price above the exercise price of the warrants  which is per share  the warrants are likely to be exercised  and we would receive the proceeds from the exercise 
we believe that our available funds will be adequate to satisfy our capital and operating requirements at least through however  there can be no assurance that changes in our research and development plans or other events affecting our revenues or operating expenses will not result in the earlier depletion of our funds 
impact of the year issue the year issue relates to numerous potential problems arising from the way that some computer software misinterprets dates after december   which could result in a computer system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
we believe that the year issue has been successfully addressed through our year compliance plan 
the total cost for upgrading our computer systems  hardware and software was less than  we did not experience any difficulties related to the year issue on january   and have not experienced any material difficulties to date 
we will continue to monitor our computer systems for potential difficulties through the remainder of the calendar year new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the new standard requires that all companies record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
our management is currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
 as amended  on our consolidated financial statements 
we will adopt this accounting standard on january   as required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
our marketable securities generally consist of corporate debt and us government securities primarily with maturities of one year or less  but generally less than six months 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive loss 
gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
interest income is recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
these investments are sensitive to interest rate risk 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonable possible near term changes in the interest rates on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material due to the short term nature of these investments 
at december   we have a bank term note at prime plus 
this note is sensitive to interest rate risk 
in the event of a hypothetical increase in the prime rate basis points  we would incur approximately  of additional interest expense per year
