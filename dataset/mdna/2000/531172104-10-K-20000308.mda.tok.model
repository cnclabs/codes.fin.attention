calculation of funds from operations management generally considers funds from operations as defined below a useful financial performance measure of the operating performance of an equity reit  because  together with net income and cash flows  funds from operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income or loss after preferred distributions computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and extraordinary items as defined by gaap  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and minority interest 
funds from operations does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap and does not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations also does not represent cash flows generated from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
funds from operations for the years ended december   and are as follows year ended december  in thousands income available to common shareholders    add back minority interest less preferred unit distributions    depreciation and amortization    extraordinary item loss on extinguishment on debt   gain loss on sale of property    funds from operations    impact of year in prior filings  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the expenses incurred during in connection with remediating the company s systems were not material 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its properties  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years  and as a result  has not had a significant impact on the company during this period 
the credit facility and certain other indebtedness bear interest at a variable rate  therefore  the amount of interest payable under the credit facility and such other indebtedness will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates  which tend to be sensitive to inflation 
to the extent an increase in inflation would result in increased operating costs  such as in insurance  real estate taxes or utilities  substantially all of the tenants leases require the tenants to absorb these costs as part of their rental obligations 
in addition  inflation also may have the effect of increasing market rental rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its credit facility and certain other indebtedness as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources and inflation 
the interest on the credit facility and such other indebtedness is subject to fluctuations in the market 
the company also uses long term and medium term debt as a source of capital 
these debt instruments are typically issued at fixed interest rates 
when these debt instruments mature  the company typically refinances such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
in addition  the company may attempt to reduce interest rate risk associated with a forecasted issuance of new debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with these transactions  the company occasionally enters into interest rate protection agreements 
if the interest rates for variable rate debt were basis points higher or lower during  the company s interest expense would have been increased or decreased by approximately million 
if the interest rates for fixed rate debt maturing and to be refinanced in are basis points higher or lower than its current weighted average rate of  the company s interest expense would be increased or decreased by approximately  due to the uncertainty of fluctuations in interest rates  the specific actions that might be taken by management to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
