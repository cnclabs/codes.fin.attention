item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction at the beginning of the company indicated that could be a difficult year for the company due to the possible impact of yk issues and the effects of the balanced budget act of and unfortunately that became true 
in both the first and second quarters of our earnings per share were below expectations 
total revenues declined from the first quarter to the second quarter and from the second quarter to the third quarter  caused by a decline in system sales and new bookings 
potential clients simply could not focus on their yk remediation efforts  deal with the decreased funding resulting from the balanced budget act of and invest in new information systems at the same time 
however  beginning in the fourth quarter of the company saw significant improvements 
revenue for the fourth quarter was the highest for the year and the second highest quarter ever recorded  bookings in the company s core business were the highest ever recorded  cash collections increased significantly and non billed receivables declined to approximately of total receivables  the lowest level since the increase in revenues and cash collections and the decline in unbilled revenues reflect our success in completing hna millennium projects  hna millennium market readiness and a declining yk impact in the company s markets 
however  did mark important accomplishments 
the company met all of its yk commitments to clients and the company s clients have had no yk related problems with the company s systems 
the company completed the successful implementation of hna millennium applications  more than double the number completed during and  and reduced the average time from project start to conversion from months at the end of to months at the end of during patient accounting and other business and management systems  where the company currently has no or limited market share  will become available 
the company believes hna millennium provides a significant competitive advantage because it utilizes the only fully integrated  large scale  enterprise wide architecture in the industry and can deliver a superior combination of functionality  efficiency  cost containment and quality control through interrelated clinical and management information systems 
although the company believes that there will be some tail to the yk impact into the year  it also believes that the impact of the balanced budget act of and the other pressures to decrease costs and provide improved care throughout the healthcare system will stimulate the market for healthcare information systems during the year results of operations year ended january   compared to year ended january  the company s revenues increased to  in from  in net earnings  before extraordinary item and non recurring charges was  in compared to  in non recurring charges in  as described below  included contract reserves and branch restructuring charges

the company switched to an hourly fee for service implementation model in delays in some of the older projects  primarily caused by delays in development of the company s hna millennium products  increased the time required to complete these installations 
while the company originally anticipated these fixed fee implementations would be completed in  in some instances the focus by clients on their internal yk projects created a further delay 
as a result of the significant implementation work completed in the last half of and the agreement between the company and these clients in the fourth quarter as to the scope of work remaining  the company estimates that the costs to complete certain fixed fee implementation contracts will exceed the remaining revenue by  the company recognized the impact of these excess costs in the fourth quarter income statement as a non recurring cost of revenues

factors that may affect future results of operations  financial condition or business statements made in this report  other reports and proxy statements filed with the securities and exchange commission  communications to stockholders  press releases and oral statements made by representatives of the company that are not historical in nature  or that state the company s or management s intentions  hopes  beliefs  expectations  or predictions of the future  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  and involve risks and uncertainties 
the words should  will be  intended  continue  believe  may  expect  hope  anticipate  goal  forecast and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that any such performance  and actual results  financial condition or business could differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in future operating results  financial condition or business over time 
quarterly operating results may vary the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods 
quarterly operating results may vary for a number of reasons including demand for the company s products and services  the company s long sales cycle  the long installation and implementation cycle for these larger  more complex and costlier systems and other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this report 
as a result of healthcare industry trends and the market for the company s hna millennium products  a large percentage of the company s revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger  more complex and costlier systems 
the sales process for these systems is lengthy and involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the customer 
the sale may be subject to delays due to customers internal budgets and procedures for approving large capital expenditures and by competing needs for other capital expenditures and deploying new technologies or personnel resources 
delays in the expected sale or installation of these large contracts may have a significant impact on the company s anticipated quarterly revenues and consequently its earnings  since a significant percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed 
these larger  more complex and costlier systems are installed and implemented over time periods ranging from approximately six months to three years and involve significant efforts both by the company and the client 
in addition  implementation of the company s hna millennium products is a new and evolving process 
the company recognizes revenue upon the completion of standard milestone conditions and the amount of revenue recognized in any quarter depends upon the company s and the client s ability to meet these project milestones 
delays in meeting these milestone conditions or modification of the contract relating to one or more of these systems could result in a shift of revenue recognition from one quarter to another and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for a particular quarter 
in addition  support payments by clients for the company s products do not commence until the product is in use 
the company s revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the first quarter of the year and greater in the fourth quarter of the year 
stock price may be volatile the trading price of the company s common stock may be volatile 
the market for the company s common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results  changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts  governmental regulatory action  healthcare reform measures  client relationship developments and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
furthermore  the stock market in general  and the market for software  healthcare and high technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the company s common stock  regardless of actual operating performance

on january  careinsite completed an acquisition of thinc 
as part of that agreement   of the  thinc warrants became immediately exercisable  with the remaining amount forfeited 
the thinc warrants expire in three years

to date  the company has not entered into any derivative financial instrument to manage foreign currency risk and is currently not evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments 
changes in the healthcare industry the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
for example  the balanced budget act of public law contains significant changes to medicare and medicaid and began to have its initial impact in due to limitations on reimbursement  resulting cost containment initiatives  and effects on pricing and demand for capital intensive systems 
these factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us healthcare system at both the federal and state level and to change healthcare financing and reimbursement systems 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions  including investments in the company s products and services 
many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
these providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for the company s products and services 
as the healthcare industry consolidates  the company s customer base could be eroded  competition for customers could become more intense and the importance of acquiring each customer becomes greater 
significant competition the market for healthcare information systems is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in this market include the breadth and quality of system and product offerings  the stability of the information systems provider  the features and capabilities of the information systems  the ongoing support for the system  and the potential for enhancements and future compatible products 
certain of the company s competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than the company and some of its competitors offer products that it does not offer 
the company s principal existing competitors include shared medical systems corporation  idx systems corporation  mckesson hboc  inc and eclipsys corporation  each of which offers a suite of products that compete with many of the company s products 
there are other competitors that offer a more limited number of competing products 
in addition  the company expects that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and system integrators  internet based start up companies and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services 
the pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions  product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements 
as a result  the company s success will depend upon its ability to keep pace with technological change and to introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new and enhanced products that satisfy changing customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
proprietary technology may be subjected to infringement claims or may be infringed upon the company relies upon a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  license agreements  confidentiality procedures  employee nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to maintain the trade secrecy of its proprietary information 
the company has not historically filed patent applications or copyrights covering its software technology 
as a result  the company may not be able to protect against misappropriation of its intellectual property 
in addition  the company could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of its products overlaps with competitive offerings 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive to defend 
if the company becomes liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights  it could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop noninfringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing intellectual property 
government regulation the united states food and drug administration the fda has declared that software products intended for the maintenance of data used in making decisions regarding the suitability of blood donors and the release of blood or blood components for transfusion are medical devices under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act act and amendments to the act 
as a consequence  the company is subject to extensive regulation by the fda with regard to its blood bank software 
if other of the company s products are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the fda  the company could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre and post marketing requirements including premarket notification clearance prior to marketing 
complying with these fda regulations would be time consuming and expensive 
it is possible that the fda may become more active in regulating computer software that is used in healthcare 
following an inspection by the fda in march of  the company received a form fda notice of inspectional observations alleging non compliance with certain aspects of fda s quality system regulation with respect to the company s pathnet hnac blood bank transfusion and donor products the blood bank products 
the company subsequently received a warning letter  dated april   as a result of the same inspection 
the company responded promptly to the fda and undertook a number of actions in response to the form and warning letter including an audit by a third party of the company s blood bank products and improvements to cerner s quality system 
a copy of the third party audit was submitted to the fda in october of and  at the request of the fda  additional information and clarification was submitted to the fda in january of there can be no assurance  however  that the company s actions taken in response to the form and warning letter will be deemed adequate by the fda or that additional actions on behalf of the company will not be required 
in addition  the company remains subject to periodic fda inspections and there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to undertake additional actions to comply with the act and any other applicable regulatory requirements 
any failure by the company to comply with the act and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its products 
fda has many enforcement tools including recalls  seizures  injunctions  civil fines and or criminal prosecutions 
any of the foregoing would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
product related liabilities many of the company s products provide data for use by healthcare providers in providing care to patients 
although no such claims have been brought against the company to date regarding injuries related to the use of its products  such claims may be made in the future 
although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage in an amount that it believes is sufficient for its business  there can be no assurance that such coverage will prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against the company which is uninsured or under insured could materially harm its business  results of operations or financial condition 
system errors and warranties the company s systems  particularly the hna millennium versions  are very complex 
as with complex systems offered by others  the company s systems may contain errors  especially when first introduced 
although the company conducts extensive testing  it has discovered software errors in its products after their introduction 
the company s systems are intended for use in collecting and displaying clinical information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients 
therefore  users of the company products have a greater sensitivity to system errors than the market for software products generally 
the company s agreements with its clients typically provide warranties against material errors and other matters 
failure of a client s system to meet these criteria could constitute a material breach under such contracts allowing the client to cancel the contract  or could require the company to incur additional expense in order to make the system meet these criteria 
the company s contracts with its clients generally limit the company s liability arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions 
anti takeover defenses the company s charter  bylaws  shareholders rights plan and certain provisions of delaware law contain certain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the company 
such provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with and obtain the approval of the board of directors in connection with any such transaction 
these provisions include i a board of directors that is staggered into three classes to serve staggered three year terms  ii blank check preferred stock  iii supermajority voting provisions  iv inability of stockholders to act by written consent or call a special meeting  v limitations on the ability of stockholders to nominate directors or make proposals at stockholder meetings  and vi triggering the exercisability of stock purchase rights on a discriminatory basis  which may invoke extensive economic and voting dilution of a potential acquirer if its beneficial ownership of the company s common stock exceeds a specified threshold 
certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of the company not approved by the board of directors in which shareholders might receive a premium value for their shares 
year as of the date of this annual report  the company has not seen any adverse impact as a result of the year transition on any of its systems or those of its clients or suppliers 
nonetheless  the company will continue to monitor the effect of the year transition  and there can be no absolute assurance that year issues will not materialize in the future and have a material adverse effect on the company  its products or its operations
