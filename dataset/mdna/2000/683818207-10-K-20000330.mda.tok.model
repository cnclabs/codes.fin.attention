item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition the company s key components of its financial condition are made up of accounts receivable  inventory  fixed assets  accounts payable and debt 
from to  there was a decrease in the company s net worth to  from  in and  in optelecom s current ratio has also decreased to in compared to in and in this decrease is attributed to the increase in debt and accounts payable and a decrease in cash offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
accounts receivable increased this year to  from  at december  this increase resulted from the long term nature of the receivable on the large shipment made to korea in october all funds for this shipment have subsequently been collected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased as a result of some receivables being written off by optelecom and its paragon unit 
also  because of the company s aggressive accounts collection program and careful screening process for any new accounts  the company has been able to significantly reduce problem accounts and the need for additional expenses in the allowance 
this aggressive approach will continue and all accounts receivable will be reviewed on an ongoing basis 
the make up of the inventory accounts changed slightly in with the company s decision to reduce its reliance on keeping items in work in process and make products for stock 
the following chart shows the composition of inventory for the past three years  with paragon inventory included in finished goods inventory composition production materials net of allowance    work in process    finished goods    total    the increase in finished goods reflects growth in cpd inventory and the addition of the paragon inventory 
although the company s objective is to reduce inventory levels as much as possible  the value of finished goods inventory increased in to provide products available from stock 
this action was taken to meet competitive pressures  as customers are demanding shorter product delivery times 
production material inventory remained at a similar level to however  this category s composition has changed to stock more items for products ordered routinely to continue to meet customers demand for product delivery time 
the company believes that its reserve for inventory obsolescence is adequate to properly value any excess quantities of this inventory 
in  fixed asset additions  including capital leases  were  compared to  in and  in  excluding the paragon acquisition 
results of operations versus revenue on a consolidated basis was lower by million or in compared to and is primarily attributed to the lower sales of the company s paragon unit  where sales fell million 
this decline in revenues is a result of a lack of significant sales from their major customer from due to the customers changing equipment needs as well as a resistance from potential customers to placing orders in the fourth quarter prior to the year also  revenue from the glint contract was curtailed during the year in anticipation of contract completion at december  optelecom s net loss of  or per share was lower than the million or per share loss recorded in the lower loss reflects the attention management paid to cost containment especially at paragon where non essential expenses established in conjunction with the original purchase were eliminated 
s loss included a million write off of intangibles related to employment commitments by the former paragon shareholders 
additionally  the company had lower selling and marketing costs as a result of personnel changes made during the year 
the company had a full complement of sales personnel at december   and believes it is structured properly for revenue growth in outside funding was not obtained for the high speed optical components project and management discontinued work on this project in the second quarter of with fewer funds being spent on the project in the company continues to expend funds on research and development of other new products 
general and administrative costs were also reduced significantly in  further evidence that the company s cost containment program was successful 
it is expected that the current level of expenditures in these categories will continue into to properly support the company s efforts 
these cost reduction activities were offset by the approximately  spent on legal expense and related costs associated with the settlement of a lawsuit with former principals of its paragon subsidiary see legal proceedings 
also  in connection with the closing and consolidation of its facilities during  the company recorded approximately  in charges against earnings 
optelecom believes it now has facilities appropriate for its current level of operations 
the glint contract ended january   but the company had performed all of its requirements under the contract by december  revenues and profits from this contract were materially lower in than in optelecom had an income tax benefit as a result of the losses from and being carried back to profits from prior years 
versus consolidated sales in were million  which represents an increase over sales of million or 
the increase in sales in is directly related to optelecom s acquisition of paragon whose sales contributed million in although the company achieved record revenues in  the operating results were significantly lower than expectations 
the company recorded a net loss of million or per share in compared to a profit of  or per share in these losses were attributed to various factors with the most significant factor the costs incurred related to the acquisition of paragon 
paragon had a loss of  during in total  the company recorded losses before income tax benefit aggregating million relating to the acquisition of paragon  which includes the write off of million in intangibles related to employment commitments by the former paragon shareholders 
in the beginning of  the company replaced the former owners with a new management team 
the company made a significant investment in its research and development efforts 
the most significant investment was the allocation of  to a new research effort related to the development of high speed optical components 
the company is committed to invest in this project until the middle of  by which time it intends to seek outside funding to continue with the product development efforts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in securing outside funding 
additional valuation reserves aggregating  were recorded in to write down inventory and accounts receivables 
they were recorded to account for obsolescence of some products and for failure to collect a portion of current accounts receivable 
another factor contributing to the downturn in profits from was lower sales from the glint program and lower sales in the cpd segment 
the glint contract is slowly winding down and  as such  revenues are expected to decline 
the company expects that revenues from the glint contract will terminate after cpd sales were down as a result of a lack of new large contract sales in compared to and the delay in the introduction of a new product  the series 
operating segments optelecom s products and services are categorized into three operating segments communications products  government products and paragon products 
the financial results for the three operating segments have been prepared on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which optelecom management internally evaluates financial information for the purpose of assisting in making internal operating decisions 
in this regard  certain common expenses have been allocated among segments differently than would be required for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
communication products division net sales    gross profit    total operating expense    operating loss income    sales for the cpd group were down from to million from million 
included in the sales for was a million shipment to korea during the fourth quarter 
sales volume was down also as a result of competitive pressures 
the gross profit for  million or of sales is down materially from the million or in and is also a result of competitive pressures as well as a lower than average gross margin on the korean order 
margins on products are expected to be more in line with historical figures such as operating expenses were million in  a reduction of over million from reflecting management s cost containment efforts 
selling and marketing costs were down from due to fewer sales personnel for most of the year and due to more focused marketing efforts 
engineering costs were down as work on the high speed optical components project was discontinued and research and development efforts were focused on digital video products as well as enhancements and improvements to paragon s line of products 
in  the cpd group underwent significant changes 
key members of management were replaced as the group regained its focus on its core competencies 
expansion efforts in severely impeded the organization  as revenue growth expectations did not materialize 
the company implemented cost reductions in and recorded approximately  related to legal costs associated with employee terminations 
sales in the cpd segment for were down almost million compared to the decline in sales was partly due to a delay in the introduction of the product series 
additionally  significant changes in the sales organization during had a negative impact on sales expectations 
two large contracts in resulted in a significant growth from the previous year 
however  these contracts did not repeat in gross profits declined by  due to the reduction in sales levels from the gross profit margin was in compared with in operating expenses increased by  or primarily due to increases in engineering and general and administrative costs 
engineering increased by  to reflect additional resources added to the engineering group 
general and administrative costs increased as a result of termination charges related to employee terminations 
government products division net sales    gross profit    total operating expense    operating income    the decline in revenues to  in from million in is primarily attributed to an approximately  drop in revenue from the glint contract 
the company completed all of its requirements under the contract by december  and the lower revenue reflects the winding down of the contract through the year 
the e o group had a decline of  in its revenue  a result of lower revenues to government sub contractors 
the gross profit margin decline is a reflection of the lower glint revenue 
the gross profit margin decline to from is indicative of the effect fixed costs had compared to the revenue levels 
e o had additional costs as the result of a facility move during the year 
e o remains the revenue base of this group and has retained capacity and efficiencies despite the move 
sales decreased by  in compared with the decline in sales was related to lower revenue on the glint contract  and a reduction in sales in the electro optics group related to darpa and honeywell systems 
the decline in revenue is expected to continue in as the glint contract requirements are completed 
gross profit declined by  in due to the decline in sales 
the gross profit margin remained unchanged at in and in operating expenses increased by  as a result of a  investment in new research and development efforts and was offset by declines in allocated administrative charges 
paragon audio visual limited paragon was acquired in december accordingly  was the first year of its operations within optelecom 
the components of paragon s losses for and are summarized as follows revenues   gross margins   operating expenses   operating loss   other paragon related expenses amortization of other intangibles   amortization of goodwill   acquisition interest   license fee   write down of intangible assets related to employment commitments  interest expense of working capital loan   loss before taxes   paragon s revenue of million was lower than the revenue recorded in of million  and can be traced to two factors first  the effect the termination of all of the prior directors of paragon and the resulting legal issues causing its customers to buy from competitors  and second  england and europe encountered tremendous reluctance from customers  particularly in the finance and banking sectors  to purchase new equipment due to the year issue 
this is reflected in the revenue level in the fourth quarter of of approximately  this concern may continue into but paragon expects their customers to have completed their analysis of the effects of the year issue early in the first quarter  and for the level of orders to begin to increase at that time 
the gross margin decreased slightly to from in and is due to increased costs of the new products introduced in paragon expects to see margins increase as the new products are placed into production and as optelecom s cpd unit engineers and manufactures more of these products 
the operating expenses were significantly lowered in to  from million in salary costs are down as a result of the termination of the prior directors of paragon  the elimination of the new york city office  and other reductions in staff  properly sizing paragon for its revenue levels 
also  they eliminated most of the company cars and other non essential expenses incurred from the acquisition 
paragon also reduced travel cost to the us and asia and eliminated all non essential entertainment costs 
paragon has taken steps to keep these and other administrative costs in line with revenues  and they expect to return to profitability during revenues for represented increased sales in paragon s products in its traditional market 
paragon sold minimal optelecom fiber products  as there were product certification and market issues that delayed the selling efforts 
the gross margin was 
this rate reflects the fact that paragon subcontracts its product design and manufacturing 
significant improvements in gross margins are expected to be realized once paragon products are developed and manufactured by the company 
operating expenses increased at a much higher rate than expected 
the number of employees doubled in from and facilities increased both by expanding the headquarters and opening a sales office in london and new york city 
significant reserves were recorded for accounts receivable and inventory 
paragon previously had not recorded provisions for bad debts or inventory obsolescence 
other operating expenses corporate income tax benefit expense was  in   in and  in the effective tax rate was in  in and in the effective tax rate was as a result of the net operating loss and stock transactions during the year 
the effective tax rate in is positively influenced by increased overseas sales  since certain tax advantages can be realized through our foreign sales corporation fsc 
interest expense was  in compared to  for and  in interest expense for decreased as a result of principal payments on the outstanding debt offset by the increased level of borrowing on the line of credit and higher interest rates during the year 
in the average borrowing under the line of credit was  compared to an average of  for the interest rate averaged in and in impact of inflation inflation has not had any significant effect on the operations of the company during  and we do not expect it to have any significant effect during liquidity and capital resources in  optelecom financed its operations through cash generated from financing activities  primarily borrowings on its bank line of credit 
the company borrowed  on its line of credit during to bring the balance to  the maximum borrowing available under its line of credit agreement 
the balance at december  was  cash used in operating activities in was  compared to cash provided by operating activities of  in showed an increase in accounts receivable of  reflecting the large receivable from the korean shipment outstanding at december   compared to a net decrease  or collections  in of  non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  remained basically constant at  compared to  in cash used in investing in was  compared to  in and reflects a decrease in capital expenditures to  in from  in one area where was materially lower than in was in cash from proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
in  there were no stock options exercised while in the company received  from the exercising of stock options 
the company has the ability  provided there are sufficient accounts receivable and inventory  to borrow up to  under its existing bank line of credit as of december  during  the company experienced negative cash flows from operations and at december   the company had borrowed the maximum amount available under its revolving line of credit agreement 
in september  the company obtained a six month deferral on principal payments due under a promissory note agreement in return for continued interest payments and increased principal payments over the remaining term of the note 
as described in note  the company was not in compliance with certain provision of its line of credit agreement for which the bank has provided a waiver 
these conditions resulted primarily from a high operating cost structure  particularly at the paragon subsidiary  expenses incurred in resolving ongoing litigation associated with the paragon acquisition  a decline in revenue at the paragon subsidiary related to a reluctance by european customers to make new equipment purchases due to year issues  and extended payment terms provided to certain customers making major purchases 
during  the company implemented significant cost cutting measures and it settled its paragon litigation see notes and 
subsequent to december   cash was collected from the customers who made the major purchases  the company received approximately  from the exercise of stock options  the company paid approximately  under the line of credit agreement  and the company commenced making principal payments under the promissory note agreement 
as of march   the company had no availability under its existing line of credit and the company currently expects that its bank will extend the line of credit agreement through may the company is continuing its cost containment measures and management currently believes that the company will have sufficient liquidity from its operations and line of credit agreement to meet its current obligations 
should the bank not extend the line of credit agreement or if the company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations  the company may be required to seek new sources of financing to meet its current obligations 
continued negative cash flows or the inability to obtain alternative financing could have a material adverse affect on the company s operations 
this bank line of credit expires may   however  management expects to renew the line of credit under substantially similar terms through may  optelecom is required to comply with certain financial ratios including maintaining a minimum current ratio  a minimum cash flow to fixed obligations as well as a maximum debt to worth ratio 
the company was in violation of its current ratio as well as its cash flow covenants at december  the bank  however  has provided a waiver of such covenants at december  paragon s future working capital needs are expected to be financed by its operating cash flows or inter company loans from the company 
paragon is operating as a stand alone entity 
should the need arise for increased cash due to increased business activity  additional funding needs will be addressed 
management anticipates that operating cash flows will generate the long term cash requirements of optelecom and paragon 
if the level of business should dictate  other infusions of capital may be needed 
paragon s business is transacted in british pounds 
the results of operations may be affected by foreign exchange gains losses 
currently neither optelecom nor paragon have hedging strategies in place 
contingencies none year optelecom engaged in a comprehensive program to upgrade its information  technology  manufacturing and financial software to properly recognize the year based on this program  the company purchased and installed hardware and software upgrades to its existing systems that are year compliant including new telephone hardware  new computer hardware as well as upgraded manufacturing and financial software 
also  optelecom analyzed all of its product offerings for any year issues 
none were discovered 
in addition  product development was reviewed and modifications  if needed  were made to make all future products year compliant 
optelecom also demanded and received assurance from all of its vendors and suppliers that any products purchased by optelecom were year compliant 
this included raw materials as well as services 
all products and services were tested and determined to be year compliant 
during  optelecom spent approximately  on hardware  software and labor costs to bring all of its systems and products in year compliance 
also included in these costs was training and external resources needed to implement any new software purchased 
optelecom determined that there was no material adverse effect of the year transition on any of its operations  including paragon 
the company has not experienced significant year issues subsequent to s fiscal year end 
the company believes that  while it continues to monitor and review its purchases  products and systems  there are no material risks or exposures to its operations in connection with the year issue 
new accounting standards in june the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 

the new standard will become effective for the company on january  the company does not currently use derivatives  and has not determined the impact  if any of these standards on its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
the company has not purchased any futures contracts nor purchased or held any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during the twelve months ended december  the primary market risk exposure is the risk that interest rates on our outstanding borrowings may increase 
optelecom currently has a bank line of credit and various term notes payable with aggregate maximum borrowings totaling approximately million 
an increase in the prime rate a benchmark pursuant to which interest rates applicable to borrowings under the credit facilities may be set equal to another basis points to the current prime rate  for example  would have increased our consolidated interest by approximately  for the twelve months ended december  optelecom has not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to the interest obligations under these lines of credit 
certain risks of foreign operations in december  optelecom purchased paragon which operates primarily in countries outside the united states and is subject to certain risks such as currency exchange rates 
there can be no assurances that these factors will not have an adverse impact on our future international sales or operating results 
we do not currently enter into foreign currency hedging transactions and therefore may be exposed to possible losses on international transactions
