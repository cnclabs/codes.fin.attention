acquisition of industrial computer corporation on april   genrad acquired all of the then outstanding common shares of industrial computer corporation icc  a software company providing real time manufacturing execution systems to electronics manufacturers 
icc was established in and is located in atlanta  georgia 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
in connection with the acquisition of icc   shares of genrad s common stock were issued for all of the then outstanding shares of icc in a tax free reorganization 
consideration for the acquisition of icc totaled approximately million 
direct costs of the acquisition totaled approximately million and consisted primarily of legal fees  accounting fees and broker fees 
consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets of icc as follows acquired in process research and development million  developed technology million  goodwill million  other intangible assets million and the net assets and liabilities of icc net liability of million 
the results of icc are included in the financial statements beginning from the date of purchase 
the valuation of acquired in process research and development was based on management s projections of the after tax net cash flows attributable to the acquired in process research and development 
specifically  the valuation considers the following i a fair market value premise  ii comprehensive due diligence concerning all potential intangible assets including trademarks and tradenames  patents  copyrights  non compete agreements  assembled workforce and customer relationships and sales channel relationships  iii the value contribution of core technology to the acquired in process technology  with a view toward ensuring the relative allocations to core technology and acquired in process research and development were consistent with the relative contributions of each to the final product  and iv the calculation used to determine the value allocated to acquired in process research and development considered only the efforts completed as of the transaction date and only the cash flow associated with the product development efforts in process at the acquisition date 
the charge for acquired in process research and development relates to one development project in process at the date of the acquisition that had not reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use  and for which ultimate successful development was uncertain 
the conclusion that the development efforts in process  or any material sub component  had no alternative future use was reached in consultation with engineering personnel from icc as well as the company s valuation advisors 
the in process project consists of the development of icc s existing unix based product using an object oriented design and standard programming language which will provide users of the product the ability to use icc s shop floor data manager tm sfdm product on varied operating platforms 
the primary project tasks open at the time of acquisition included completion of the design of certain modules  or objects  which will house the program code  completion of program code written in the new language and preliminary quality assurance and testing of the product 
at the time of acquisition  additional development remained on all tasks management estimated that the project was approximately complete and costs to complete were estimated to total approximately  at the time of the acquisition  management believed that the product being developed would become available for sale late in fiscal genrad will begin to benefit from the acquired in process research and development once completed product is sold 
failure to reach successful completion of this project may result in impairment of the associated capitalized intangible assets  ie goodwill and developed technology  and or may require the company to accelerate the time period over which the intangibles are being amortized  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
significant assumptions used to determine the value of the acquired in process research and development included several factors 
the first was a forecast of net cash flows that were expected to result from the in process development effort using projections prepared by icc management  portions of which and were provided to genrad s board of directors 
net cash flow projections included projected revenue growth and trends in profit margins and selling  general and administrative expense that were consistent with recent historical trends prior to the acquisition 
second  a percentage complete of for the project estimated by considering the costs invested to date relative to the expected total cost of the development effort  supported by the amount of technological progress completed as of the transaction date relative to the overall technological achievements required to achieve the intended functionality of the eventual product 
the technological issues were addressed primarily by engineering representatives from icc along with the company s independent valuation advisors 
third  a discount rate  which represents a rate equivalent to that which would be employed in a fair value analysis  ie  one that considers all cash flows associated with the project and resulting product  and therefore represents a blended rate of all the risks associated with the product 
lastly  a core technology charge reflected as one third of after tax net income related to the in process project was utilized 
this rate represents an amount that the company would be required to pay in royalties assuming it had licensed the products expected to be derived from the acquired in process development efforts 
as of january   the technological feasibility of the project had been reached with the development effort on going 
no significant departures from the assumptions included in the valuation have occurred 
as of january   the company believes that the product will be ready for sale during the summer of acquisition of manufacturing execution systems business on april   genrad acquired certain assets of the manufacturing execution systems mes business of valstar systems limited valstar located in aberdeen  scotland

stock repurchase program during the three months ended july   the company commenced a stock repurchase program whereby the company will purchase  in the open market  shares of its stock 
the company intends to buy back its stock at times when its market value presents opportunities to do so 
the company s stock repurchase plan is intended as a means to partially mitigate the dilutive impact of stock options and to provide an alternative investment for the company s excess cash 
the plan has been funded entirely through operating cash flow  however  the company may  if it considers it prudent  utilize its available credit facilities in connection with its stock repurchase program 
during the twelve months ended january  and january   the company utilized approximately million and million to repurchase  and  shares  respectively  of its common stock 
credit facility in march  the company re negotiated its existing million credit facility  increasing the total borrowings available to million the new line 
the new line is supported by a syndicated group of banks and provides for up to million to be utilized for acquisitions and million to be used for general working capital purposes 
the new line requires the company to maintain certain financial and operating covenants  as defined  and expires in march borrowings on the line to be utilized for acquisitions are payable quarterly  while borrowings on the line to be utilized for general working capital are payable on demand 
the line bears interest at the lesser of the banks prime rate plus or libor plus  as determined from time to time by the banks 
under the terms of the new line  the company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the line ranging from to of the total unused portion of the line dependent on the company s operating performance 
summary the company s primary source of liquidity has been internally generated funds 
in  the company anticipates it will fund its working capital and capital expenditure requirements  make principal and interest payments on its borrowings and meet its cash obligations from internally generated funds and from its available credit facility 
as the company continues to invest in new product developments and enhancements to existing products  it expects research and development expenditures to continue at approximately the same percentage of sales as prior fiscal years 
effects of inflation and foreign exchange although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on its operations  it does not believe inflation has had a material effect on its revenues or its results of operations 
the company attempts to mitigate inflationary cost increases by continuously improving manufacturing methods and technologies 
management does not expect inflation to have a significant impact on operations in the foreseeable future 
the company maintains development  sales and support facilities in several locations worldwide  including  england  france  germany  switzerland  singapore  and mexico  among others 
a significant amount of the company s business is conducted with companies located in these and other countries and certain transactions may be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  the company may experience transaction gains and losses as a result of currency fluctuations 
in order to minimize its exposure to loss from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the company mitigates its risk using foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the company s currency risk mitigation strategies are designed to reduce the company s vulnerability to certain foreign currency exchange exposures 
in executing its strategies  the company actively monitors foreign currency exchange rates and executes foreign currency forward exchange contracts  primarily with financial institutions 
these contracts serve to offset the impact of actual foreign currency changes  eg  if currency rates changed with respect to a certain transaction resulting in a loss to the company  the forward contract would be structured to result in a gain  thereby minimizing the actual loss incurred  if any 
the company may be subject to losses resulting from unanticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the market factors that expose the company in this regard include economic conditions in which the company conducts business as well as the company s ability to effectively and efficiently engage in foreign currency forward exchange contracts at competitive rates with financial institutions or others 
the company expects to continue these or similar practices in the future to the extent appropriate 
historically  actual results of the company s foreign currency risk management procedures have been in line with management s expectations and have not resulted in significant gains or losses  however  there can be no assurance that these results will continue in the future 
factors that may affect future results this annual report may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the company s actual results of operations and future financial conditions may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements as a result of many factors that may be beyond the company s control 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience fluctuations in its results of operations  particularly on a quarterly basis 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues 
if revenue levels in a particular period do not meet expectations  due to the timing of the receipt of orders from customers  customer cancellations or delays of shipments  then operating results could be adversely impacted 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological change  an increased demand for specific feature requests by customers  evolving industry standards  and frequent new product introductions 
the introduction of products embodying new technology or the emergence of new industry standards or practices could render the company s existing products obsolete or otherwise unmarketable 
future operating results are dependent upon the company s ability to develop  design  manufacture and market technologically innovative products that meet customer needs 
competition in the markets where the company operates is intense 
the company continues to invest in manufacturing productivity to try to minimize the impact of competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations within the company s product mix  potential inventory obsolescence exposure and start up manufacturing costs for new product introductions 
the company is dependent upon a number of suppliers for several key components of its products 
the loss of certain of the company s suppliers  supply shortages or increases in the costs of key raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the year issue many computer systems and other equipment with embedded chips or processors use only two digits to represent the year 
consequently  they may be unable to process certain dates before  during and after the year as a result  entities are at risk for possible miscalculations or system failures causing disruptions in their operations 
genrad has evaluated its operations to assess modifications needed for this issue 
a full time project manager position was established in to address the year issue 
in october  genrad completed a comprehensive worldwide program that identified and corrected potential material problems related to the year in its products  information systems  infrastructure and manufacturing facilities 
costs incurred to date for the year issue  primarily related to software corrections  are approximately million with estimated future costs of million 
the costs were and will continue to be funded through internally generated resources  without cannibalizing the company s information technology budget or resources  and expensed as incurred in accordance with eitf  accounting for the costs associated with modifying computer software for the year management believes that its internal year issues were addressed in a manner that prevented such issues from having a material adverse effect on genrad results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurances that management will be successful in addressing all its internal year issues or that all of the company s external interfaces will be successful in addressing their year issues 
if management or any significant external interface is not successful  the company s operating results and financial position could be materially and adversely impacted 
in the worst case  although not anticipated or considered likely by genrad management  the company may not be able to operate manufacturing facilities or other support functions which would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations for periods subsequent to management believes that its contingency plans  which include the use of alternative manufacturing facilities currently available to the company  and business systems  which the company currently utilizes  are adequate to mitigate the risk associated with the company s worst case scenario 
the introduction of the euro the company is aware of and has developed systems designed to handle the introduction of the euro as an effective currency in europe 
although the company believes the systems that have been implemented are sufficient for the company to be able to process euro denominated transactions  there can be no assurances that such systems will actually function as designed 
if they do not so function  genrad s financial results could be adversely affected 
to date  the company has not encountered any significant processing issues related to the introduction of the euro 
the introduction of the euro has not materially affected the manner in which the company conducts its operations  nor has it required the company to alter any significant contracts with suppliers and or financial institutions 
other factors other factors which could impact future results are past and future acquisitions  strategic alliances  patent or product liability claims in excess of available insurance coverage  changes in the company s effective tax rates  new regulatory requirements  political and economic changes  tariffs  trade restrictions  transportation delays  foreign currency fluctuations and inflation 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward looking statements that may be included in this report 
additionally  there can be no assurance that other factors  not included above  could impact future results
