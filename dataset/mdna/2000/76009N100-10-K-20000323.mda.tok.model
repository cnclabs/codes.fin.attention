the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under the caption selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
general we have pursued an aggressive growth strategy since we were acquired in by j 
ernest talley  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
we have sought to acquire underperforming stores to which we could apply our operating model 
as a result  the acquired stores have generally experienced more significant revenue growth during the initial periods following their acquisition than in subsequent periods 
because of significant growth since our formation  our historical results of operations and period to period comparisons of such results and certain financial data may not be meaningful or indicative of future results 
we expect to continue to grow through both the acquisition of existing stores and the opening of new stores 
if we open new stores or acquire under performing or unprofitable stores  start up costs associated with new stores and excess salaries  other overhead costs and operating results associated with acquired stores could negatively impact our earnings until these stores are fully integrated into our operations and become profitable 
components of income revenue 
we collect non refundable rental payments and fees in advance  generally on a weekly or monthly basis 
this revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement 
rental purchase agreements generally include a discounted early purchase option 
amounts received upon sales of merchandise pursuant to such options  and upon the sale of used merchandise  are recognized as revenue when the merchandise is sold 
franchise revenue 
revenue from the sale of rental equipment is recognized upon shipment of the equipment to the franchisee 
franchise fee revenue is recognized upon completion of substantially all services and satisfaction of all material conditions required under the terms of the franchise agreement 
depreciation of rental merchandise 
except for tax purposes  we depreciate our rental merchandise using the income forecasting method 
the income forecasting method of depreciation does not consider salvage value and does not allow the depreciation of rental merchandise during periods when it is not generating rental revenue 
for periods prior to  we used the income forecasting method to calculate depreciation of our rental merchandise for tax purposes 
however  in  we began using the macrs method of depreciation using a five year class life for our rental purchase merchandise 
in august  the internal revenue service issued a revenue ruling requiring rental purchase companies to use macrs  with a three year class life for all purchases after august  we began application of the ruling for all purchases effective august   and thereafter 
cost of merchandise sold 
cost of merchandise sold represents the book value net of accumulated depreciation of rental merchandise at time of sale 
salaries and other expenses 
salaries and other expenses include all salaries and wages paid to store level employees  together with market managers salaries  travel and occupancy  including any related benefits and taxes  as well as all store level general and administrative expenses and selling  advertising  occupancy  fixed asset depreciation and other operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate overhead expenses related to our headquarters such as salaries  taxes and benefits  occupancy  administrative and other operating expenses  as well as regional directors salaries  travel and office expenses 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles consists primarily of the amortization of the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of acquired assets and liabilities

depreciation of rental merchandise increased by million  or  to million for from million for depreciation of rental merchandise expressed as a percent of store rentals and fees revenue decreased from in to in this decrease is primarily attributable to central rents and thorn americas experiencing depreciation rates of and  respectively  upon their acquisition in these rates have decreased following the implementation of our pricing strategies and inventory management practices 
salaries and other expenses expressed as a percentage of total store revenue increased to for from for this increase is principally attributable to incentive programs given to store based employees in whereby they could achieve their year pay plans early if they achieved targeted gains in the number of items on rent and targeted reductions in the percentage of delinquent accounts 
although the costs associated with these programs were incurred ahead of the associated benefit  the satisfaction of these operational targets will benefit us during when we collect rentals and fees on a larger number of items on rent  with fewer accounts in delinquency 
occupancy costs also increased as a percentage of total store revenue due to the relocation of certain stores acquired in to locations that are larger in square footage 
generally  revenue from these stores increased gradually while the additional occupancy costs were incurred immediately 
general and administrative expenses expressed as a percent of total revenue decreased from in before the million non recurring expense detailed below  to in this decrease was the result of increased revenues from the stores acquired from central rents and thorn americas  allowing us to leverage our fixed and semi fixed costs over the larger revenue base 
operating profit increased by million  or  to million for from million for in the third quarter of  we incurred a pre tax non recurring expense of million to effect a name change of the renters choice stores to rent a center

stated before the effects of these expenses  operating profit increased by million  or 
operating profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to in from in  calculated before the effects of the non recurring expenses 
this increase is attributable to our efforts in improving the efficiency and profitability of the stores acquired from central rents and thorn americas 
net earnings increased by million  or  to million in from million in in addition to the million and million pre tax non recurring expenses discussed above  we also incurred pre tax non recurring financing costs of million associated with interim financing utilized in the acquisition of thorn americas until permanent financing was obtained 
the after tax effect of these items was million 
calculated before the effects of these non recurring expenses  net earnings increased by million  or 
comparison of the years ended december  and during we acquired  stores  of which were subsequently consolidated with existing locations and one of which was sold 
these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases  and accordingly  the operating results of the acquired operations have been included in the results of operations since the respective dates of acquisition 
primarily as a result of the effects of these acquisitions on our results of operations  comparisons of operating results for and may not be meaningful or indicative of future results 
total revenue increased by million  or to million for from million for the increase in total revenue was primarily attributable to the inclusion of  stores purchased in  net of store consolidations

occupancy costs also increased as a percentage of total store revenue due to the relocation of certain stores acquired in and to locations that are larger in square footage

operating profit increased by million  or  to million for from million for this improvement was primarily due to an increase in both the number of items on rent and in revenue earned per item on rent in the stores acquired before the revenue increase exceeded increases in direct store expenses and the million pre tax non recurring legal settlement expensed as a result of us settling certain class action litigation in new jersey 
net earnings decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily the result of us incurring non recurring financing costs of million associated with the interim financing utilized in the thorn americas acquisition  million in losses on disposed renters choice signage as a result of the name change to rent a center  and million relating to certain class action legal settlements  as well as increased interest expense relating to the financing required to complete the acquisitions completed in all of the above costs are stated gross of the effects of income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity requirements are for debt service under our senior credit facilities  the subordinated notes  other indebtedness outstanding  working capital and capital expenditures 
at december   we had in place an million senior credit facility 
the amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility  subordinated notes  and other indebtedness as of this date were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
we purchased million of rental merchandise during the year ended december  for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities decreased by million  from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of investment in new rental merchandise required by our product mix rationalization strategy for the acquired central rents and thorn americas stores and for the settlement of litigation  partially offset by increased profitability in these acquired stores 
cash used in investing activities decreased by million from million in to million in  primarily due to the purchase of central rents and thorn americas occurring in cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million in  which represented the source of funds for the purchase of central rents and thorn americas 
borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at varying rates equal to to over the designated prime rate  which was per annum at december   or to over libor  which was at december   at our option 
at december   the average rate on outstanding borrowings was 
during  we entered into certain interest rate protection agreements with two banks 
under the terms of the interest rate agreements  the libor rate used to calculate the interest rate charged on million of the outstanding senior term debt has been fixed at an average rate of 
these interest rate agreements have terms of three and five years 
borrowings were collateralized by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
a commitment fee equal to to of the unused portion of the term loan facility is payable quarterly 
the senior credit facility includes certain net worth and fixed charge coverage requirements  as well as covenants which restrict additional indebtedness and the disposition of assets not in the ordinary course of business 
principal and interest payments under the senior credit facilities  the subordinated notes  and other indebtedness represent significant liquidity requirements for us 
as of march   we owed approximately million under our various debt facilities and our subordinated notes 
under our various debt agreements  we will be required to make minimum principal payments totaling approximately million in  million in and  and million in and  plus applicable interest 
loans under the senior credit facilities not covered by interest rate swap agreements bear interest at floating rates based upon the interest rate option selected by us 
as discussed earlier  as of march  we have pre paid a further million of our senior debt during capital expenditures are made generally to maintain existing operations and for new capital assets in new and acquired stores 
we spent million on capital expenditures in the year ended december   and expect to spend a total of approximately million on capital expenditures in the year ended december  management is currently focusing its efforts on enhancing the operations and the depth of management in the acquired stores 
during  we have resumed our strategy of increasing our store base and annual revenues and profits through the opening of new stores  as well as through opportunistic acquisitions 
it is our intention to increase the number of stores in which we operate by an average of approximately per year over the next several years 
we plan to accomplish our future growth through selective and opportunistic acquisitions  with an increasing emphasis on new store development 
typically  a newly opened store is profitable on a monthly basis in the sixth to seventh month after its initial opening 
historically  a typical store has achieved break even profitability in to months after its initial opening 
total financing requirements of a typical new store approximates million  with roughly to of that amount relating to the purchase of rental merchandise inventory 
a newly opened store historically has achieved results consistent with other stores that have been operating within the system for greater than two years by the end of its third year of operation 
there can be no assurance that we will open any new stores in the future  or as to the number  location or profitability thereof 
we believe that the cashflow generated from operations  together with amounts available under our senior credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements  working capital needs  capital expenditures  litigation costs  and our store expansion intentions during at december   we had million available under our various debt agreements 
the revolving credit facility provides us with revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding million 
in addition  the million letter of credit multidraw facility that was being used to support litigation assumed in connection with the thorn americas acquisition via a letter of credit has been converted to a million multi draw facility following the termination of the letter of credit 
during  we funded the settlements of the robinson  boykin  gallagher and burney lawsuits 
please see the section entitled legal proceedings discussed earlier 
as a result  and based upon our extensive review and analysis of our current outstanding litigation and the potential exposure thereon  we believe that litigation expenses related to outstanding litigation will not be significant in in addition  to provide any additional funds necessary for the continued pursuit of our operating and growth strategies  we may incur from time to time additional short or long term bank indebtedness and may issue  in public or private transactions  equity and debt securities 
the availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number of factors  some of which will relate to our financial condition and performance  and some of which will be beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
inflation during the years ended december   and  the cost of rental merchandise  lease expense and salaries and wages has increased modestly 
the increases have not had a significant effect on our results of operations because we have been able to charge commensurately higher rental rates for our merchandise 
update on year computer issues during we undertook initiatives to ensure that our systems were year compliant as well as contacting major customers and vendors to assess their status 
as of the date of this filing  we have not experienced any disruption of our operations due to year issues 
the cost of year modifications have not been significant and no additional year costs are anticipated 
quarterly results the following table contains certain unaudited historical financial information for the quarters indicated

however  we did consolidate stores into existing locations 
during  six stores were purchased during the first quarter  stores were purchased during the second quarter   stores were purchased during the third quarter  and four stores were purchased during the fourth quarter 
of the  stores acquired  were subsequently consolidated with existing store locations 
in addition  one store was opened during the first quarter  and one store was sold during the third quarter 
during the third quarter of  we incurred pre tax non recurring financing costs of million associated with the interim financing utilized in the acquisition of thorn americas  and million associated with effecting a name change of the renters choice stores to rent a center 
during the fourth quarter of  we charged million pre tax to earnings classified as class action legal settlements  in conjunction with the settlement of class action litigation in new jersey 
effect of new accounting pronouncements during the second quarter of  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments imbedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we will adopt sfas no later than the first quarter of fiscal year sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the sec issued sab no 
 restructuring and impairment charges which provides guidance regarding the accounting for and disclosure of certain expenses commonly reported in connection with exit activities and business combinations 
in december  the sec issued sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements which provides the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
these sab s are not expected to have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity as of december  we had million in subordinated notes outstanding at a fixed interest rate of 
at this date  we also had million in term loans outstanding  million outstanding under revolving credit facilities  and million outstanding under a multi draw facility indexed to the libor rate 
the subordinated notes mature on august  and have a fixed interest rate of 
the fair value of the subordinated notes is estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality 
the fair value of the subordinated notes at december  was million  which is million in excess of their carrying value of million 
unlike the subordinated notes  the million in term loans  the million outstanding under revolving credit facilities  and the million outstanding under a multi draw facility have variable interest rates indexed to current libor rates 
because the variable rate structure exposes us to the risk of increased interest cost if interest rates rise  in we entered into million in interest rate swap agreements that lock in a libor rate of  thus hedging this risk 
these contracts have an average life of four years 
given the current capital structure  including our interest rate swap agreements  we have million  or of our total debt  in variable rate debt 
a hypothetical change in the libor rate would affect pre tax earnings by approximately million 
the swap agreements had an aggregate fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical change in the libor rate would affect the fair value of the swaps by approximately million 
market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by fluctuations in interest rates 
our primary market risk exposure is fluctuations in interest rates 
monitoring and managing this risk is a continual process carried out by the board of directors and senior management 
we manage our market risk based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
interest rate risk we hold long term debt with variable interest rates indexed to prime or libor that exposes us to the risk of increased interest costs if interest rates rise 
to reduce the risk related to unfavorable interest rate movements  we have entered into certain interest rate swap contracts on million of debt to pay a fixed rate of
