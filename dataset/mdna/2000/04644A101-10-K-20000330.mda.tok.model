item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  manufacture  market and sell a range of solar electric power products  including solar cells  modules and panels  for the global marketplace 
solar cells are semiconductor devices which convert sunlight into electricity and form the building block for all solar electric power products 
historically  our products have primarily been used to generate electricity for users not connected to the utility grid 
such applications include electrification of rural homes and villages  and power supply for equipment in the communications and transportation industries 
more recently our products are also being used by customers already connected to the utility grid as a clean  renewable source of alternative or supplemental electricity 
additionally  through our joint venture agreement with gpu international  we generate and sell wholesale solar electric power 
we currently generate product revenues from the sale of solar cells  modules  and panels 
although we are continuing a significant expension of our silicon film manufacturing capacity  the predominant source of our product revenues to date has been recycled wafer products 
we recognize product sales revenue upon shipment 
solar cell prices and manufacturing costs vary depending upon supply and demand in the market for solar cells and modules  order size  yields  the costs of raw materials  particularly reclaimed silicon wafers recycled from the semiconductor industry  and other factors 
product sales represented of total revenues for the year ended december  in addition  we also generate revenue from contracts with various federal government agencies to conduct research on advanced silicon film products and optoelectronic devices 
generally  these contracts last from six months to three years 
we recognize research contract revenue at the time costs benefiting the contracts are incurred  which approximates the percentage of completion method 
for the year ended december   of our product revenues were generated by sales to customers located outside of the united states 
we believe that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our product sales for the foreseeable future 
current sales are denominated in us dollars and foreign exchange rate fluctuations have not had an impact on our results of operations 
solar cells that we manufacture are sold to original equipment manufacturers that assemble the solar cells into modules 
we sell modules to distributors and value added resellers 
the sale of a module results in substantially more revenue to us than the sale of solar cells due to the value of the additional materials  labor and overhead added during the module assembly process 
accordingly  our product sales are affected not just by changes in total solar cells produced  but by changes in the mix between solar cells and modules sold 
the gross margin percentages for modules are generally less than those of solar cells and as a result  changes in the mix of solar cells and modules sold may affect total product gross margin 
substantially all of our revenues from government contracts are subject to audit under various federal statutes 
although we have received final written acceptance of our overhead rates through  the defense contract audit agency is now disputing certain elements of those submissions as well as the overhead rates for and the dispute is centered on the effect of our manufacturing operations on our government contract overhead rates during the years of transition from a contract research and development organization to commercial manufacturing 
the overhead rates for have been submitted  but have not yet been audited 
this dispute does not affect our overhead rates for  and  inasmuch as we revised our methodology for determining overhead rates 
we believe that adjustments to revenue  if any  will not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition  but may impact results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues product sales research contracts total revenues cost of revenues product sales research contracts total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses product development expenses general and administrative expenses selling expenses total operating expenses income from operations other income expense net income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income comparison of years ended december  and revenues our total revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or from million for the year ended december  product sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or from million for the year ended december  our increase in product sales was due to increased levels of production from both of our manufacturing facilities  as well as continued strong customer demand 
research contract revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  or from million for the year ended december  gross profit our gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or from million for the year ended december  gross profit on product sales was million  an increase of million or from million for the year ended december  gross profit margin on product sales for the year ended december  was  as compared with for the year ended december  the increase in product gross margin was due to increases in manufacturing volumes and productivity  which reduced product unit costs 
gross profit on research contracts for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or from the year ended december  gross profit margin on research contracts for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit and gross margin in is due to higher effective overhead rates 
product development expenses product development expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of  or from million for the year ended december  the increase in product development expenses was attributable to increased levels of engineering and manufacturing support dedicated to the development of our silicon film production process 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or from million in the increase was due to higher levels of bad debt expense  staffing  professional services  and insurance costs 
selling expenses our selling expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of  or from  for the year ended december  the increase was due to higher levels of staffing  travel and advertising expenses 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or from  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower levels of debt outstanding in as a result of the repayment of a convertible note in the fourth quarter of interest income interest income for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or from  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a lower level of cash balances during however  in the fourth quarter of  the company completed a follow on equity financing  raising net proceeds of million 
equity in joint ventures equity in the results of joint ventures was  for the year ended december  there was no comparable amount in one of the ventures was formed in  and the other venture did not have significant operations until income taxes income tax expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to a benefit of  for the year ended december  the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rates principally as a result of research and experimentation tax credits and the benefit of a foreign sales corporation 
the benefit represents the change in the valuation allowance pertaining to the company s net operating loss carryforward 
net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately million are available through to reduce federal and state taxable income as of december  comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
our total revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  product sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  our increase in product sales was due to increased levels of production from the addition of a second manufacturing facility in the first half of as well as improvements in manufacturing technology and manufacturing productivity  allowing us to satisfy a greater percentage of backlog orders 
research contract revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decline of  or  from million for the year ended december  the decline in research contract revenue  which was expected  was primarily attributable to continued reduction of our contract overhead rates as a result of the ongoing transformation from a government contractor to a manufacturing company 
gross profit 
our gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or from million for the year ended december  gross profit on product revenues for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from million for the year ended december  gross profit margin on product revenues for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the year ended december  the change in product gross margin was affected by our expansion into a second manufacturing facility 
during the first half of  we incurred start up costs such as the hiring and training of new employees and facility operating costs  but generated little revenue to offset such costs 
in the second half of  the quantities of product manufacturing increased and generated revenues  but the gross margins remained below those of our other manufacturing facility 
we expect further improvement in our product gross margins in as the production levels in the solar park facility continue to increase 
product gross margins in the fourth quarter were also affected by disruptions to the manufacturing process caused by the installation of new manufacturing equipment  the qualification of new vendors and the large numbers of new employees required to be hired and trained 
these issues are expected to continue to negatively affect our financial results for the first half of gross profit on research contract revenues for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or  from  for the year ended december  gross profit margin on research contracts revenue for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin was attributable to a reduction in our contract overhead rates as a result of our ongoing transition to a manufacturing company  which reduces the amount of overhead expenses that we previously allocated and billed to government contracts 
product development expenses 
our product development expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of  or  from million for the year ended december  the increase in product development expenses was attributable to increased levels of engineering and manufacturing support dedicated to the development of our silicon film production process 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of  or  from million in the increase was due to increased salary expense due to additional positions to support our growth and the costs of being a public company legal and accounting fees  liability insurance  printing  stockholders communications but were offset by a lower level of bonuses 
selling expenses 
our selling expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  from  for the year ended december  the increase in selling expenses was due to increased salary  advertising and travel expenses offset by the elimination of sales commissions paid to third parties 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or from  for the year ended december  the decline in interest expense was attributable to a reduction in our level of indebtedness  including the repayment of bank debt in march and the repayment of the million convertible promissory note in october interest income 
interest income principally net interest income for the year ended december  was  as compared with interest income of  for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to increased cash balances and related levels of interest income as a result of the proceeds of our initial public offering 
income taxes 
an income tax benefit of  was recorded for the year ended december  as compared with  of expense for the year ended december  the benefit represents the change in the valuation allowance pertaining to the company s net operating loss carry forwards 
the expense represents the company s alternative minimum tax liability 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash of million  as compared with million at december  and million at the end of cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  was principally due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances 
cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  was due principally to increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
cash used by investing activities of million for the year ended december  related to our capital equipment expenditures to increase our manufacturing capacity and to investments in joint ventures of  total capital equipment expenditures were approximately million 
in  cash used in investing activities was million and principally was due to capital expenditures relating to the fit up of our pencader plant 
net cash provided from financing activities of million for the year ended december  was due to a follow on public offering and to proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
for  net cash provided from financing activities was million  and was comprised of million in proceeds from our initial public offering and reduction in debt balances of million 
our sources of liquidity as of december  consist principally of cash of million  and available bank credit lines of million 
any borrowings under our bank facilities will be secured by accounts receivable  inventory and machinery and equipment 
we expect that our available cash balance  project cash generated from operations and available bank credit lines will be sufficient to fund our activities for the foreseeable future 
in the event we accelerate our manufacturing expansion plans we may need to seek additional funding 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and market our products in north america as well as in the europe and asia pacific and africa regions 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
because all of our revenues are currently denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is not a material risk exposure 
year we met our year project objectives and completed the project prior to year end 
we have not experienced any disruption in our operations as a result of non compliance of vendors  financial institutions  or other third parties or external systems 
at this time  the possibility of a third party risk arising  which could have a material risk on the company  is not reasonably likely to occur 
in we developed a year program to identify  evaluate  test  upgrade  or replace each of our computer based systems in connection with year readiness 
we completed the process of modifying  upgrading  remediating and replacing major computer related systems that were identified as potentially non compliant in june in we requested letters of compliance from critical external suppliers to determine the status of their efforts to become year compliant 
total costs associated with our year project were funded with operating cash flow and approximated  of which approximately  was incurred in and approximately  was incurred in
