item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview the company focuses on two major telecommunications markets 
the first is the monitoring of alarms from pbxs  voice mail systems and data networks 
this market is referred to as the intelligent systems management market for which the product is sold directly to service providers to enable them to be pro active in maintaining their systems 
a typical service provider are companies such as gte  williams communications  sprint  mciworldcom and bellsouth 
the company maintains a sales force nationwide to service these major customers 
the company has been successful in not only increasing the number of products sold to these customers  but also finding new service provider customers 
typically the sales cycle would be six months to eighteen months while the customer tests the product before installation 
a new customer would then purchase an irisngen  which is a centralized piece of software that monitors the alarms at the remote sites 
at the remote sites  the company provides one of its seb ii s or an intellim n  which is an alarms management  monitoring  pro active computerized device 
the company expects to continue to invest in r d to develop  not only later versions of the centralized windows nt software irisngen  but also the seb hardware with an anticipated seb iii which should be available in the fall of year  which would enable sophisticated monitoring  of not only voice networks  but data networks in one box 
the second telecommunications market is in the pbx arena which involves providing telephone switches to small and medium size businesses as well as advanced acd automatic call distribution 
the vision switching product has a sophisticated cti computer telephony interface and is an extremely robust digital switch 
this product is sold through distribution  not directly to the end user customers 
therefore  after the company signs up a new distribution channel  teleco for example  the distributor first established all of its structures and pricing to enable it to sell to their customers 
typically  this requires at least six months to a year before any positive results are realized from any new distribution channels that the company has established 
within the vision switching product line  is a version for emergency the company  up until recently  had an exclusive supply contract with motorola  under which motorola branded the product as a centralink and provided all sales channels 
during the company terminated the exclusivity of the contract with motorola and entered into an agreement with lucent public safety to market the switch into its markets 
in addition  motorola continues to promote the company s products 
again  this is not an overnight process 
lucent has validated the switch and are now prepared to market it to their customers 
lucent s customers are typically the rbocs regional bell operating companies  eg sbc 
however  before sbc will release this product to their customers  they need to fully validate the switch  run tests  establish beta sites  etc 
which could take six months to a year before any significant sales materialize from that channel 
the company also is investing in this product range 
the company has already brought it up to date with the necessary pri bri isdn interfaces  but continues to invest in the processor of the product to enable ip telephony in the future 
the company has been successful in manufacturing its own products  reducing costs and increasing gross margins 
to supplement our own business  the company also sells electronic manufacturing services to companies that require high quality but have low volume 
this enables the company to maximize the facility and reduce overhead costs 
interactive solutions  a majority owned subsidiary of the company  has invested heavily in developing a small  wearable mobile computer 
it has also invested in sophisticated software as an enabling technology for voice applications 
recently  the company discontinued internal development of the hardware  but continues to develop software and has applied for a patent  for a specific process 
the company is currently investigating the market potential for the new process 
it has also sourced a more powerful computer board to fit into the mentis plastics to allow for a minimum of a mhz pentium iii 
the company has continued to grow each year  the majority of which is through organic growth 
however  it is clear that the business has experienced seasonality to its growth due in part to purchasing tendencies of our customers during the fourth and first quarters of each year 
consequently  results for the fourth and first quarters of each year are not as strong as results during the other quarters but year to year growth has been maintained 
the company is endeavoring to spread its sales across more product lines to reduce the seasonal impact which should materialize as vision sales increase 
acquisitions on february   the company acquired certain assets and the technology of cascade technology corporation cascade 
the company acquired all of cascade s rights to and in certain technology for a discoverymate panel link display  open sales orders and certain other assets 
the display is sold to ford visteon  chrysler  general motors  kelsey hayes and other companies 
the company delivered an aggregate of  restricted shares including  shares in escrow for claims by the company of its voting common stock for selected assets of cascade

impact of year teltronics prepared for the impact of the arrival of the year on its business 
the year issue is a term used to describe the problems created by systems that are unable to accurately interpret dates after december  these problems are derived predominantly from the fact that many software programs categorize the year in a two digit format 
the year issue creates potential risks for teltronics  including potential problems in teltronics products as well as in the information technology it and non it systems that teltronics uses in its business operations 
teltronics may also be exposed to risks from third parties with whom teltronics interacts who fail or have failed to adequately address their own year issues 
teltronics pursued an organized program to assure teltronics products  production  equipment and information systems and related infrastructure were year compliant 
teltronics year program included four phases an audit and assessment phase designed to identify year issues  a modification and testing phase designed to correct year issues internally  a purchase phase designated to correct year issues externally  and an implementation and test phase to install and test the system for year compliance for external purchases 
teltronics completed the audit and assessment phases for all products 
the modification of all products and related testing was completed by december  selected older and discontinued products are not year compliant and customers were so advised 
the cost to update products for year compliance was not significant and was completed in conjunction with ongoing development efforts 
teltronics completed an assessment of production equipment and related infrastructure 
such equipment and infrastructure was year compliant 
teltronics also completed an assessment of the year issue for the computer system  which includes finance and production hardware and software 
teltronics leased a new computer system that is year compliant 
this system cost  and was capitalized in internal costs increased  per year due to the computer system installation 
the external installation and training costs were  and the installation was completed by april   which was prior to any significant impact of the year issue on teltronics operating systems 
training and installation costs of  related to the new computer system were expensed as of december  the  was paid from operating cash flow 
the system installation did not defer any additional systems projects 
teltronics has not encountered any year problems subsequent to december  related to product  equipment or information systems 
however  not all external vendors or systems have been used at this date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
all borrowings under the company s bank line of credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on the prime rate 
an increase in interest rates of basis points would not significantly impact the company s net income 
all of the company s business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations should not have a significant impact on the company
