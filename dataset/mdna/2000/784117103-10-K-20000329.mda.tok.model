item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in thousands  except per share data this discussion reviews and analyzes the consolidated financial condition at december  and  the consolidated results of operations for the past three years  and other factors that may affect future financial performance 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements and selected financial data 
we are organized around our four business lines technology services  asset management  mutual fund services  and investments in new business 
financial information on each of these segments is reflected in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included with item to this report 
results of operations compared with consolidated overview income statement data in thousands  except per common share data percent change revenues technology services   asset management   mutual fund services   investments in new business   total revenues   operating income loss technology services   asset management   mutual fund services   investments in new business   other   income from operations   other income  net   income from continuing operations before income taxes   income taxes   income from continuing operations   diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations revenues and earnings from continuing operations reached a new record level in  primarily from new business in technology services and asset management 
technology services operating results reflect increases in recurring processing fees generated from new clients and the delivery of new products to our existing clients 
asset management operating results were boosted by significant increases in assets under management from new and existing clients in our investment advisory and institutional asset management businesses 
comparative results reflect an unusually large one time revenue event in  that was triggered by the acquisition of one of our largest technology clients that resulted in the recognition of a substantial contractual buyout fee 
excluding this one time item  total revenues actually increased percent and earnings per share increased percent 
revenues and earnings are expected to increase assuming the sales momentum in asset management can be sustained and we can continue to generate new business and cross sell new and existing products in technology services 
however  continued consolidation in the banking industry or a prolonged unfavorable change in the financial securities markets could impede growth in revenues and earnings 
the effective tax rate from continuing operations was percent for and income taxes are accounted for according to statement of financial accounting standards no

assets under administration consist of total assets for which we provide management and administration services  including client proprietary fund balances for which we provide administration and or distribution services 
technology services the technology services segment provides trust technology outsourcing to banks and other financial institutions with our trust product line 
trust includes a myriad of integrated products and sub systems that provide a complete investment accounting and management information system for trust institutions 
trust operations outsourcing incorporates the trust product line within a package of services that includes investment management  custody and other back office capabilities 
through this business  we handle a trust department s back office administration function 
this allows trust institutions to concentrate on expanding and servicing their clients 
dollar percent change change revenues trust technology services    trust operations outsourcing    total revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing    total operating profits    profit margin trust technology services revenues are primarily generated from monthly processing and software application fees from our trust product line and project fees associated with the conversion of new clients onto our trust product line 
there was an unusually large one time revenue event in late that was triggered by the acquisition of one of our largest technology clients by a third party 
as a result  revenues in included million in one time contractual buyout fees associated with the loss of this one client 
excluding the effects of this one time fee  trust technology services revenues actually increased million or percent 
trust technology services revenues increased due to growth in recurring processing fees and project fees generated from new clients that had purchased our products and services in prior years  as well as from new products implemented for existing clients 
recurring processing fees increased million or percent and project fees increased million or percent 
we expect an increase in recurring processing fees through the delivery of new products and services to our existing clients and the contracting of new clients for processing services 
we are currently reviewing strategies to expand the delivery of our trust technology services into the non bank and offshore markets 
penetrating these new markets could provide many new opportunities 
however  consolidations within the banking industry continues to be a major strategic issue facing this segment 
our trust operations outsourcing business continued to generate new business in revenues are derived from processing and management fees 
revenues earned from processing services accounts for approximately percent of total trust operations outsourcing revenues in and percent in  while investment services comprise the remaining percent in and percent in this shift in revenues can be attributed to growth in assets from existing clients and an increase in sales for investment services in the community and regional bank markets 
we anticipate this trend will continue 
we are currently expanding our trust operations outsourcing efforts beyond the community and regional bank markets because we believe that our trust operations outsourcing service is an attractive alternative to any trust institution faced with the task of building the necessary infrastructure to support the delivery of trust services 
operating profits and profit margin for technology services increased substantially during operating profits and profit margin in were inflated by the inclusion of the significant one time buyout fee previously discussed 
this one time event contributed approximately million to operating profits in excluding the effect of this one time event  operating profits actually increased percent 
the increase in operating profits and profit margin reflect increased system sales in the large bank market over the last few years and back office sales in the community bank market 
in addition  our current infrastructure allows us to carefully manage expenses over a higher net incremental recurring revenue base 
as a percentage of sales  operating and development expenses decreased to percent from percent while sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly to percent from percent 
asset management the asset management segment provides investment solutions through various investment products and services distributed directly or through professional investment advisors  financial planners  and other financial intermediaries to institutional or high net worth markets 
the primary products offered include money market funds and diversified investment strategies and portfolios delivered to these markets through mutual funds and other pooled vehicles 
dollar percent change change revenues investment management fees    liquidity management fees    total revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing    total operating profits    profit margin investment management fees are earned through management fees that are based upon a fixed percentage  referred to as basis points  of the average daily net asset value of assets under management 
investment management fees increased percent due to strong asset growth in both our investment advisory and institutional asset management businesses 
additionally  the favorable trend experienced in the financial securities markets during partially contributed to the growth in assets under management 
average assets under management increased billion or percent to billion during  as compared to billion during in our investment advisory business  we continue to be successful at recruiting new registered investment advisors 
we established approximately  new registered investment advisor relationships during  bringing our total network to almost  advisors 
we have also been working closely with our existing advisors to assist them in expanding their existing client base through the introduction of new investment options and programs 
our institutional asset management business also experienced strong business growth during we established new institutional client relationships during  of which nine new relationships funded over million each 
these new relationships included defined benefit plans  defined contribution plans  endowments and foundations 
we anticipate continued growth in this segment through the generation of new business and the delivery of new investment products and services 
liquidity management fees consist of our money market  short term mutual funds and cash sweep technology that are marketed to corporations and investment firms 
the percent increase in liquidity management fees was mainly driven by an increase in average assets under management and increased sales of the cash sweep technology product 
average assets under management increased billion or percent to billion during  as compared to billion during we successfully recruited new cash sweep technology clients and new institutional clients during however  short term interest rate volatility slowed the use of money market funds during which dampened the growth in liquidity management fees 
operating profits and profit margin increased substantially during profit margin improvement resulted from two primary factors 
first  our ability to continually leverage on our existing infrastructure allowed us to increase revenues while controlling variable operating costs 
as a percentage of sales  operating and development expenses decreased to percent from percent and sales and marketing expenses decreased to percent from percent 
second  we introduced new investment programs and initiatives to our existing clients 
this provided opportunities to generate additional revenues from our existing client base 
the current trend in revenues  profits and profit margin improvement is projected to continue in we are optimistic about our asset management business as we can continue to leverage expenses over higher net incremental assets and introduce new investment products and services into new and existing markets 
however  any significant devaluation in the financial securities markets could negatively affect revenues and profits 
mutual fund services the mutual fund services segment provides administration and distribution services to proprietary mutual funds created for banks  insurance firms  and investment management companies 
these services include fund administration and accounting  legal services  shareholder recordkeeping  and marketing 
dollar percent change change revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing   total operating profits   profit margin mutual fund services revenues are earned through administrative and distribution fees that are based upon a fixed percentage  referred to as basis points  of the average daily net asset value of the proprietary funds 
the amount of basis points earned is specific to each proprietary fund complex and can vary among complexes 
the increase in revenues was fueled by growth in average proprietary fund balances  which increased billion or percent to billion during versus billion during average proprietary fund balances increased primarily due to growth in existing large bank complexes 
also  an increased presence in the non bank and offshore markets has yielded positive returns during a significant portion of the growth in average assets during can be attributed to non bank and offshore clients 
however  revenues were negatively affected by a decrease in average basis points earned because of fee concessions extended to existing clients in exchange for longer term contracts and a reduction in the range of certain services to large bank clients 
the outlook for mutual fund services revenues remains optimistic 
we will continue to aggressively focus our efforts in the non bank and offshore markets 
initially  each of these new clients will not generate as much revenue as a large bank complex  but we believe this is a growing market that has significant growth potential 
although revenues increased percent  operating profits and profit margin decreased in  primarily from reduced fees from large bank clients and from a significant increase in operating and development expenses 
as a percentage of sales  operating and development expenses increased to percent from percent 
this increase reflects our critical investments to support our initiatives in the non bank and offshore markets and to develop new technology that will differentiate our services in an increasingly commoditized product area 
we believe that the non bank and offshore markets hold the greatest growth potential in the upcoming years 
our ability to provide unique and specialized services should generate many additional opportunities to increase revenues and improve profit margin 
however  continued consolidations and possible further margin pressure in the large bank sector could have an adverse effect on future revenues and profits 
investments in new business investments in new business consist of our international asset management initiatives and canadian operations

operating and development expenses in increased mainly due to increased business activity  a stronger commitment to enhancing products  the write off of previously capitalized software development costs  and the direct correlation between bank related brokerage services revenues and direct expenses 
the contracting of new clients required additional personnel and other related operating costs in order to properly implement  service  and maintain these new relationships 
additionally  substantial investments were incurred to analyze and improve the implementation process for new clients 
these investments included process redesign and infrastructure reinvention 
operating and development expenses were significantly affected in due to several factors associated with software development costs 
first  each year  we evaluate strategies for new and existing software products  as well as performing a recoverability assessment of software development projects currently in production 
the recoverability assessment included an evaluation of expected future revenues and cash flows  acceptability of the software product in its target market  a cost benefit analysis as to the delivery and support of the software product  and any technological advancements that could enhance or render the product obsolete 
as a result  certain projects were considered either obsolete or incapable of achieving the expected results in their original design and approximately million of net software development costs previously capitalized were written off during the fourth quarter of second  in order to keep a competitive edge  substantial investments in research and development costs for the trust product line were incurred during finally  with the completion and subsequent release of several capitalized software development projects  amortization expense increased during asset management dollar percent change change revenues investment management fees    liquidity management fees    total revenues    expenses operating and development   sales and marketing    total operating profits    profit margin substantial increases in average assets under management generated the percent increase in revenues

additionally  many new institutional clients were contracted for services in liquidity management fees consist of our money market  short term mutual funds and cash sweep technology that are marketed to corporations and investment firms

two primary factors contributed to this increase

assessment of the transition into the year background we began work on the year issue in with management recognition that failure to acknowledge  analyze and remediate potential year processing issues could result in material consequences to our financial position and operating results 
through early  we focused our efforts on an assessment of our trust product line and by mid  we expanded our efforts to include a review of all proprietary systems  vendors  internally used systems and any other item that might have been affected by the year a corporate year committee was formed consisting of representatives from every area of our business and was managed by a full time senior project manager

our year program fully subscribed to the federal financial institutions examination council guidelines 
contingency plans contingency planning efforts were focused on the most critical business functions and varied significantly based on a system s functionality and how it operates 
these plans incorporated an analysis of activities and processes that occurred prior to  during and after the transition into the year for many business critical functions  we developed both a remediation contingency plan and a business resumption contingency plan 
the remediation contingency plan dealt with how to react and quickly fix the disruption 
the business resumption contingency plan involved developing alternative ways to continue critical operations in the event of a year disruption 
a rapid response team was available during peak processing times to execute our year contingency plans 
throughout the post event period  we continued to monitor most critical business functions to ensure the smooth operation of all systems 
costs to address year issues the cost of year remediation and testing of the trust product line was projected to be approximately million 
through december   approximately million has been spent  of which approximately million has been capitalized pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the spending dedicated to the trust product line represents the material costs incurred to achieve year compliance 
all year compliance costs for all other proprietary systems  including those used for internal business purposes  were expensed as incurred or capitalized if new software or hardware was purchased 
these costs were immaterial 
transition into the year throughout the event period  a variety of tests and activities were performed to validate our critical applications  software  hardware  systems and infrastructure were operating as expected 
specific post event milestones were identified and monitored closely  such as first month end processing in year  leap year processing  dividend postings  etc 
there were no critical year issues 
all critical infrastructure systems and hardware were operational 
no critical data integrity issues were reported and no client access or service problems were reported
