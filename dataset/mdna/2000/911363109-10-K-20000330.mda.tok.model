fluctuations in operating results the company expects that its revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors  including seasonal rental patterns of the company s customers  with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter  changes in general economic conditions in the company s markets  including changes in construction and industrial activities  the timing of acquisitions  new location openings  and related expenditures  the effect of the integration of acquired businesses and start up locations  if the company determines that a potential acquisition will not be consummated  the need to charge against earnings any expenditures relating to such transaction such as financing commitment fees  merger and acquisition advisory fees and professional fees previously capitalized  the timing of expenditures for new equipment and the disposition of used equipment  and changes in demand for the company s equipment or the prices therefor due to changes in economic conditions  competition or other factors 
the company is continually involved in the investigation and evaluation of potential acquisitions 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company capitalizes certain direct out of pocket expenditures such as legal and accounting fees relating to potential or pending acquisitions 
indirect acquisition costs  such as executive salaries  general corporate overhead  public affairs and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
the company s policy is to charge against earnings any capitalized expenditures relating to any potential or pending acquisition that the company determines will not be consummated 
there can be no assurance that the company in future periods will not be required to incur a charge against earnings in accordance with such policy  which charge  depending upon the magnitude thereof  could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company will be required to incur significant start up expenses in connection with establishing each start up location 
such expenses may include  among others  pre opening expenses related to setting up the facility  and expenses in connection with training employees  installing information systems and marketing 
the company expects that  in general  start up locations will initially operate at a loss or at less than normalized profit levels 
consequently  the opening of a start up location may negatively impact the company s margins until the location achieves normalized profitability 
there may be a lag between the time that the company purchases new equipment and begins to incur the related depreciation and interest expenses and the time that the equipment begins to generate revenues at normalized rates 
as a result  the purchase of new equipment  particularly equipment purchased in connection with expanding and diversifying the company s rental equipment  may periodically reduce margins 
year in prior years  the company discussed the nature of its plans to become year compliant 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its equipment  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year inflation although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on its operations  the company believes that inflation has not had  and is not likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material impact on its results of operations

factors that may influence future results and accuracy of forward looking statements sensitivity to changes in construction and industrial activities our equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities 
consequently  a downturn in construction or industrial activity may lead to a decrease in demand for our equipment  which could adversely affect our business 
we have identified below certain of the factors which may cause such a downturn  either temporarily or long term 
a general slow down of the economy  
an increase in interest rates  
adverse weather conditions which may temporarily affect a particular region  or 
government funding for highway and other construction projects does not reach expected levels 
fluctuations of operating results we expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors  including 
seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter  
the timing of expenditures for new equipment and the disposition of used equipment  
changes in demand for our equipment or the prices therefor due to changes in economic conditions  competition or other factors  and 
increases in the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt 
dependence on additional capital to finance growth we will require substantial capital in order to execute our growth strategy 
we will require capital for  among other purposes  establishing new rental locations  completing acquisitions  and acquiring rental equipment 
if the cash that we generate from our business  together with cash that we may borrow under our credit facility  is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements  we will require additional debt and or equity financing 
we cannot  however  be certain that any additional financing will be available or  if available  will be available on terms that are satisfactory to us 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future  our ability to implement our growth strategy could be limited 
certain risks relating to acquisitions we have grown  in part  through acquisitions and expect to make additional acquisitions 
the making of acquisitions entails certain risks  including 
acquired companies could have hidden liabilities that we fail to discover during our due diligence investigations  
we may have difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company with our existing operations  
we may lose key employees of the acquired company  and 
we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies 
dependence on management we are highly dependent upon our senior management team 
consequently  our business could be adversely affected in the event that we lose the services of any member of senior management 
furthermore  if we lose the services of certain members of senior management  it is an event of default under the agreements governing our credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness  unless we appoint replacement officers satisfactory to the lenders within days 
we do not maintain key man life insurance with respect to members of senior management 
competition the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive 
our competitors primarily include small  independent businesses with one or two rental locations  regional competitors which operate in one or more states  public companies or divisions of public companies  and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers 
we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new companies 
in addition  certain equipment manufacturers may commence or increase their existing efforts relating to renting and selling equipment directly to our customers 
liability and insurance we are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business 
these include claims relating to personal injury or death caused by equipment rented or sold by us  motor vehicle accidents involving our delivery and service personnel and employment related claims 
we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations 
however  such insurance may not fully protect us for a number of reasons  including 
our coverage is subject to a deductible of million and limited to a maximum of million per occurrence  
we do not maintain coverage for environmental liability  since we believe that the cost for such coverage is high relative to the benefit that it provides  and 
certain types of claims  such as claims for punitive damages or for damages arising from intentional misconduct  which are often alleged in third party lawsuits  might not be covered by our insurance 
we cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms  if at all 
environmental and safety regulations there are numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters 
these include laws and regulations that govern wastewater discharges  the use  treatment  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials  air quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances 
under these laws  an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for  among other things  the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances located on  in  or emanating from  the real estate  as well as related costs of investigation and property damage and substantial penalties  and environmental contamination at facilities where its waste is or has been disposed 
these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or lessee knew of the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances and whether or not the owner or lessee was responsible for these substances 
our activities that are or may be affected by these laws include our use of hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment and our disposal of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing 
we also dispense petroleum products from underground and above ground storage tanks located at certain rental locations  and at times we must remove or upgrade tanks to comply with applicable laws 
furthermore  we have acquired or lease certain locations which have or may have been contaminated by leakage from underground tanks or other sources and are in the process of assessing the nature of the required remediation 
based on the conditions currently known to us  we believe that any unreserved environmental remediation and compliance costs required with respect to those conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
however  we cannot be certain that we will not identify adverse environmental conditions that are not currently known to us  that all potential releases from underground storage tanks removed in the past have been identified  or that environmental and safety requirements will not become more stringent or be interpreted and applied more stringently in the future 
if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated by us  our business could be adversely affected depending on the magnitude of the cost 
risks related to international operations our operations outside the united states are subject to risks normally associated with international operations 
these include the need to convert currencies  which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates  and the need to comply with foreign laws 
dependence on information technology system our ability to monitor and control our operations depends to a large extent on the proper functioning of our information technology system 
any disruption in this system or the failure of this system to operate as expected could  depending on the magnitude and duration of the problem  adversely affect our business and our ability to implement our growth strategy 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk primarily consists of interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations 
interest rate risk 
the company periodically utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates 
at december   the company had interest rate protection in the form of swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the effect of these agreements is to limit the interest rate exposure to on the outstanding balance of term loan b and on million of term loan c 
all borrowings under our million credit facility bear interest at a variable rate of interest 
the outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility was million as of december  our other variable rate debt primarily consists of a million term loan b and a million term loan c 
the weighted average interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt as of december  were i for the credit facility  ii for the term loan b and iii for the term loan c 
based upon the amount of variable debt that we had outstanding as of december  approximately billion in the aggregate  our net income would decrease by approximately million for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 
the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility from time to time 
for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
currency exchange risk 
the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar 
as a result  our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars 
based upon the current level of our canadian operations  a change in this exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings 
in addition  the company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge its transaction exposures 
at december   the company had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes
