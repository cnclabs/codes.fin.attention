item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview increased sales of the company s transgenic cotton varieties containing the bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies  or both  to of total domestic unit sales coupled with increased sales in australia and greece are the major reasons that d pl reported record sales of million up from million in the company sold  in the us  sufficient quantities of seed containing the bollgard and or roundup ready gene technologies to plant approximately million acres in versus approximately million acres planted in domestic upland cotton acreage planted increased to million acres in from million acres in even though cotton prices were at recent record lows 
since the prices of crops that compete for the cotton acreage in d pl s primary territory corn and soybeans were relatively even lower  cotton acreage was favorably affected 
on december   monsanto withdrew its pre merger notification filed pursuant to the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of hsr act effectively terminating monsanto s efforts to gain government approval of the merger 
on december   the company filed suit the december suit in the first judicial district of bolivar county  mississippi  seeking among other things  the payment of the million termination fee due pursuant to the merger agreement  compensatory damages of billion and punitive damages in an amount to be proved at trial for monsanto s breach of contract 
on january   the company and monsanto reached an agreement whereby the company would withdraw the december suit  and monsanto would immediately pay the million 
on january   monsanto paid to the company a termination fee of million as required by the merger agreement 
on january   the company re filed a suit reinstating essentially all of the allegations contained in the december suit 
the million termination fee  net of related expenses  is separately presented as special charges and unusual income item  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
in july  the company announced the consolidation of the three divisional sales and marketing staffs and three divisional technical services staffs into one corporate wide sales and marketing team and one corporate wide technical services team that will serve the three brands deltapine  suregrow  and paymaster 
approximately forty salaried positions were eliminated which generated severance pay and relocation costs of approximately million which were recorded as special charges 
actual savings approximated million in fiscal the three divisional research programs were combined into a single company wide program  and two new research facilities were launched in the company s effort to invest its resources where it believes it has the best opportunity for developing new products for commercial introduction 
net sales and licensing fees in  d pl s consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million from sales of million 
the increase is primarily the result of a increased sales of upland picker cottonseed varieties that contain either or both of the bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies  b increased sales of roundup ready soybeans and c increased sales reported by the australian subsidiary  joint ventures in china and brazil and the successful sales efforts of a new distributor in greece 
in  domestic transgenic cottonseed sales comprised approximately of total domestic unit sales of cottonseed  compared to approximately in roundup ready soybean units comprised approximately of total units sold in compared to in international sales increased to million in from million in due to sales increases in australia and greece 
the effects of these increases were partially offset by a decline in export sales in certain smaller markets 
in  d pl s consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million from sales of million 
the increase is primarily the result of a increased sales cottonseed varieties that contain either or both of the bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies  b increased sales of roundup ready soybeans and c record sales reported by the australian subsidiary and the joint ventures in china 
in  transgenic cottonseed sales comprised approximately of total domestic unit sales of cottonseed  compared to approximately in roundup ready soybean units comprised approximately of total units sold in compared to in international sales increased to million in from million in due to sales increases in australia and china which resulted in both entities reporting profits in the effects of these increases were partially offset by a decline in export sales to mexico which was caused by a reduction in planted cotton acreage due to inclement weather and lower commodity prices 
gross profit d pl s consolidated gross profit increased to million in compared to million in this is primarily attributable to the increased penetration of transgenic cottonseed varieties in the us  increased sales in the company s international segment as discussed above and the absence of special charges in compared to special charges of million which were recorded in and are discussed below 
d pl s consolidated gross profit after special cotton and soybean seed inventory write offs of million was million in compared to million in special pre tax charges of million were recorded in that relate to the write off of excess cottonseed and soybean seed 
the cottonseed was purchased to ensure that d pl had ample supplies of both conventional and transgenic cottonseed varieties since management was uncertain of the ultimate sales mix for the season 
commodity prices of corn  cotton and soybeans  and their impact on farmer planting decisions  the increased flexibility of planting decisions by farmers afforded by the freedom to farm act  coupled with wide scale availability in of cottonseed of varieties that contained both the bollgard and roundup ready genes which were available only in limited quantities and varieties in as well as the introduction of new varieties  made forecasting with any degree of certainty difficult 
the company wanted to be prepared to meet farmer demand and purchased additional seed in to ensure it had adequate supplies of both conventional and transgenic varieties 
soybean seed sales were one third less than planned for  and the resultant excess inventory approximately million was written off at year end 
the product lines of both cotton and soybeans continue to realign to those varieties with transgenic traits 
gross margin expressed as a percentage of sales before special inventory charges was in compared to in the decline is attributable to increased sales of transgenic cottonseed varieties which carry a lower gross margin compared to conventional varieties since the company s gross margin on technology fees approximates 
operating expenses operating expenses before special charges decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due savings which resulted from the reorganization of the company s sales and marketing and technical service staffs which were partially offset by higher research and general and administrative costs 
recurring operating expenses are expected to increase somewhat in over levels 
in  special charges related to severance pay and benefits of million resulting from the elimination of the divisional sales and marketing and divisional technical services staffs  and costs associated with the ultimately terminated merger with monsanto which approximated million  were included as operating expenses 
these charges are in addition to the inventory write offs noted earlier which are recorded as cost of sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses did not change materially in from levels since savings achieved by the consolidation were offset by the cost of new research programs 
the company expects recurring research and development costs in to remain consistent with levels 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased transgenic seed development activities  additional variety trials and seed testing and increased cotton research activities in argentina  australia  brazil  china  greece  and spain 
selling expenses selling expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to the company s reorganization of the sales and marketing staff and the related synergies for the company s advertising and promotional efforts 
selling expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is related to higher fees paid the california department of food and agriculture on seed sales made in california  sales and marketing activities by the company s joint ventures in argentina and brazil  increased advertising  and the costs associated with an incentive program designed to promote the sale of transgenic seed 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase primarily consists of expenses related to expansion of the company s operations in argentina and brazil  an increase in insurance costs and higher legal fees associated with the litigation discussed in item and non us patents  trademark and variety registrations 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase relates to expenses related to operations in argentina and brazil and higher legal fees associated with non us patents  trademark and variety registrations 
special charges and unusual charges related to acquisitions in fiscal  the company reported  as an unusual income item  the million merger termination fee  net of related expenses  which was paid by monsanto to d pl pursuant to the terms of the may   merger agreement

such costs are primarily legal and professional fees and reserves established for losses on the planned disposition of certain assets 
the company also paid severance and related benefits of approximately million to approximately forty employees who were terminated in august  in connection with the reorganization of the sales and marketing and technical services departments 
in connection with the evaluation and pursuit of various strategic alternatives and ultimately the planned merger with monsanto  the company incurred  in  approximately million associated with legal  investment banker and other professional fees 
interest income expense the company reported net interest income of million in compared to net interest expense of million in due to lower average borrowings resulting from an increase of cash generated by operating activities and interest earned on the million merger termination fee collected from monsanto

liquidity and capital resources the seasonal nature of the company s business significantly impacts cash flow and working capital requirements 
the company maintains credit facilities  uses early payments by customers and uses cash from operations to fund working capital needs 
for more than years d pl has borrowed on a short term basis to meet seasonal working capital needs 
in the united states  d pl purchases seed from contract growers in its first and second fiscal quarters 
seed conditioning  treating and packaging commence late in the first fiscal quarter and continue through the third fiscal quarter 
seasonal borrowings normally commence in the first fiscal quarter and peak in the third fiscal quarter 
loan repayments normally begin in the middle of the third fiscal quarter and are typically completed by the first fiscal quarter of the following year 
d pl also offers customers financial incentives to make early payments 
to the extent d pl attracts early payments from customers  bank borrowings under the credit facility are reduced 
the company records receivables for licensing fees on bollgard and roundup ready seed sales as the seed is shipped  usually in the company s second and third quarters 
the company has contracted the billing and collection activities for bollgard and roundup ready licensing fees to monsanto 
in september  the technology fees are due at which time d pl receives payment from monsanto 
d pl then pays monsanto its royalty for the bollgard and roundup ready licensing fees 
in april  the company entered into a syndicated credit facility with its existing lender and two other financial institutions which provides for aggregate borrowings of million 
this agreement provides a base commitment of million and a seasonal commitment of million 
the base commitment is a long term loan that may be borrowed upon at any time and is due april  the seasonal commitment is a working capital loan that may be drawn upon from september through june of each fiscal year and expires april  each commitment offers variable and fixed interest rate options and requires the company to pay facility or commitment fees and to comply with certain financial covenants 
at august   the company had million available for borrowing under the base commitment 
the financial covenants under the loan agreements require the company to a maintain a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth at august  of less than or equal to to to at the company s other quarter ends b maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of each quarter greater than or equal to to and c maintain at all times tangible net worth of not less than the sum of i million plus ii of net income but not losses determined on the last day of each fiscal year  commencing with august  at august  the company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth exceeded the permitted ratio  at which time the financial institutions waived compliance with this covenant 
at august   the company was in compliance with those covenants 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item capital expenditures were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that domestic capital expenditures will approximate million in capital expenditures in for international ventures are expected to approximate million depending on the timing and outcome of such projects 
cash provided from operations  early payments from customers and borrowings under the loan agreement should be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs 
risks and uncertainties from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  existing products  technical developments  new products  research and development activities  and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of the company s business include those noted elsewhere in this item and filing and the following demand for d pl s seed will be affected by government programs and policies and  most importantly  by weather 
demand for seed is also influenced by commodity prices and the demand for a crop s end uses such as textiles  animal feed  food and raw materials for industrial use 
these factors  along with weather  influence the cost and availability of seed for subsequent seasons 
weather impacts crop yields  commodity prices and the planting decisions that farmers make regarding both original planting commitments and  when necessary  replanting levels 
the planting seed market is highly competitive  and d pl varieties face competition from a number of seed companies  diversified chemical companies  agricultural biotechnology companies  governmental agencies and academic and scientific institutions 
a number of chemical and biotechnology companies have seed production and or distribution capabilities to ensure market access for new seed products and new technologies that may compete with the bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies 
the company s seed products and technologies contained therein may encounter substantial competition from technological advances by others or products from new market entrants 
many of the company s competitors are  or are affiliated with  large diversified companies that have substantially greater resources than the company 
the production  distribution or sale of crop seed in or to foreign markets may be subject to special risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency  exchange rate controls  expropriation  nationalization and other agricultural  economic  tax and regulatory policies of foreign governments 
particular policies which may affect the domestic and international operations of d pl include the use of and the acceptance of products that were produced from plants that were genetically modified  the testing  quarantine and other restrictions relating to the import and export of plants and seed products and the availability or lack thereof of proprietary protection for plant products 
in addition  united states government policies  particularly those affecting foreign trade and investment  may impact the company s international operations 
the recent publicity related to genetically modified organisms gmos or products made from plants that contain gmos may have an effect on the company s sales in the future 
in  approximately of the company s cottonseed that was sold contained either the bollgard  roundup ready  or both gene technologies and of the company s soybean seed sales contained the roundup ready gene technology 
although many farmers have rapidly adopted these technologies  the alleged concern over finished products that contain gmos could impact demand for crops and ultimately seed raised from seed containing such traits 
due to the varying levels of agricultural and social development of the international markets in which the company operates and because of factors within the particular international markets targeted by the company  international profitability and growth may be less stable and predictable than domestic profitability and growth 
overall profitability will depend on the factors noted above as well as weather conditions  government policies in all countries where the company sells products and operates  worldwide commodity prices  the company s ability to successfully open new international markets  the company s ability to successfully continue the development of the high plains market  the technology partners ability to obtain timely government approval and maintain such approval for existing and for additional biotechnology products on which they and the company are working and the company s ability to produce sufficient commercial quantities of high quality planting seed of these products 
any delay in or inability to successfully complete these projects may affect future profitability
