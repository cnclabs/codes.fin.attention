item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general extended stay america  inc was organized on january  as a delaware corporation to develop  own  and operate extended stay lodging facilities 
studio plus hotels  inc was formed in december and acquired all of the assets of the sph predecessor entities  which owned and operated studioplus tm extended stay facilities since the acquisition of the interests of the sph predecessor entities was accounted for as if it were a pooling of interests 
on april   we completed a merger with sph 
the  shares of sph common stock that were outstanding on the closing date were converted into  shares of our common stock and options to purchase  shares of sph common stock were converted into options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
as a result of the merger  sph became one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
our accompanying consolidated financial statements give effect to the merger  which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we own and operate three brands in the extended stay lodging market studioplus tm deluxe studios  extended stayamerica efficiency studios  and crossland economy studios sm 
each brand is designed to appeal to different price points below per week 
all three brands offer the same core components a living sleeping area  a fully equipped kitchen or kitchenette  and a bathroom 
extended stay rooms are designed to compete in the economy category 
crossland rooms are typically smaller than extended stay rooms and are targeted for the budget category  and studioplus facilities serve the mid price category and generally feature larger guest rooms  an exercise room  and a swimming pool 
during  we repositioned studioplus properties as extended stay properties 
all operating statistics reflect the repositioning of these properties as extended stay properties for the entire periods presented 
the table below provides a summary of our selected development and operational results for   and year ended december  total facilities open at period end 
total facilities developed average occupancy rate average weekly room rate average occupancy rates are determined by dividing the rooms occupied on a daily basis by the total number of rooms 
due to our rapid expansion  our overall average occupancy rate has been negatively impacted by the lower occupancy typically experienced during the pre stabilization period for newly opened facilities 
we expect the negative impact on overall average occupancy to decline as the ratio of newly opened properties to total properties in operation declines 
average weekly room rates are determined by dividing room revenue by the number of rooms occupied on a daily basis for the applicable period and multiplying by seven 
the average weekly room rates are generally greater than standard room rates because of stays of less than one week  which are charged at a higher nightly rate  higher weekly rates for rooms that are larger than the standard rooms  and additional charges for more than one person per room 
we expect that our future occupancy and room rates will be impacted by a number of factors  including the number and geographic location of new facilities as well as the season in which we open those facilities 
we also cannot assure you that we can maintain our occupancy and room rates 
the following is a summary of our development status as of december   by brand 
we expect to complete the construction of the facilities currently under construction generally within the next twelve months  however  we cannot assure you that we will complete construction within the time periods we have historically experienced 
our ability to complete construction may be materially impacted by various factors including final permitting and obtaining certificates of occupancy  as well as weather induced construction delays

studioplus total because newly opened properties typically experience lower occupancies during their pre stabilization period  average occupancy rates are impacted by the ratio of newly opened properties to total properties 
the average occupancy rate in for the properties we owned and operated as of january  was 
similarly  the average occupancy rate in for the properties we owned and operated as of january  was 
the decline in the average occupancy rate for properties open for at least one year at the beginning of each year is primarily attributable to an increase during those periods in the supply of available rooms in the lodging industry generally and specifically in certain of the markets in which we operate 
we expect that this increase in supply  particularly in certain markets in texas and north carolina  will continue to impact our occupancies until incremental demand is sufficient to compensate for the additional supply of available rooms 
the impact of the additional supply of available rooms was offset by the impact of a decline in the ratio of newly opened properties to total properties for each of our brands  resulting in overall average occupancy rates of for compared to for the increase in overall average weekly room rates for as compared to reflects the geographic dispersion of properties opened during and the higher standard weekly room rates in certain of those markets 
the increase also is due in part to increases in rates charged at previously opened properties 
the average weekly room rate for the properties that we owned and operated throughout both periods increased by in the increase in our overall average weekly room rates for as compared to is diluted by an increase in the percentage of total occupied rooms attributable to the lower priced crossland brand 
occupied rooms attributable to the crossland brand were of total occupied room nights for compared to for the decrease in the average weekly room rate for the studioplus brand is primarily the result of lower rates experienced in certain markets in texas and north carolina in response to an increase in the supply of available rooms in those markets 
we recognized total revenue of million in and million in this is an increase of million  or 
approximately million of the increased revenue was attributable to properties that we opened during and  and approximately million was attributable to an increase in revenue for the properties that we owned and operated throughout both periods 
property operating expenses  consisting of all expenses directly allocable to the operation of the facilities but excluding any allocation of corporate operating and property management expenses  depreciation  or interest were million of total revenue for compared to million of total revenue for we expect the ratio of property operating expenses to total revenue to generally fluctuate inversely relative to occupancy rate increases or decreases because the majority of these expenses do not vary based on occupancy 
our overall occupancy rates were for and for and our property operating margins were for both years 
the provisions for depreciation and amortization for the lodging facilities were million for and million for these provisions were computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
these provisions reflect a pro rata allocation of the annual depreciation and amortization charge for the periods for which the facilities were in operation 
depreciation and amortization for increased compared to because we operated additional facilities in and because we operated for a full year the properties that were opened in corporate operations corporate operating and property management expenses include all expenses not directly related to the development or operation of lodging facilities 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel and certain marketing costs  as well as development costs that are not directly related to a site that we will develop 
we incurred corporate operating and property management expenses of million of total revenue in and million of total revenue in the increase in the amount of these expenses for as compared to reflects the impact of additional personnel and related expenses in connection with the increased number of facilities we operated 
we expect these expenses will continue to increase in the future 
depreciation and amortization was million for and million for these provisions were computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for assets not directly related to the operation of our facilities 
these assets were primarily office furniture and equipment 
we realized  of interest income during and million of interest income during this interest income was primarily attributable to the temporary investment of funds drawn under our credit facilities 
we incurred interest charges of million during and million during of these amounts  million during and million during was capitalized and included in the cost of buildings and improvements 
we recognized income tax expense of million of income before taxes for and million of income before taxes for our income tax expense differs from the federal income tax rate of primarily due to state and local income taxes 
we expect that our annualized effective income tax rate for will be approximately 
other charges income in  unfavorable capital market conditions resulted in a reduction in our development plans for and as a result  we established a valuation allowance of million for the write off of costs related to sites that would not be developed 
the operating results for reflect the reversal of million of this valuation allowance resulting from the renegotiation of the terms of a number of the optioned sites 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting pursuant to the statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities issued by the accounting standards executive committee  effective january   we changed our method of accounting for compensation and other training related costs incurred prior to the opening of a property to expense them as they are incurred 
accordingly  we recorded an expense of  net of income tax benefit of  as the cumulative effect of this change in accounting

the decline in the average occupancy rate for properties open for at least one year at the beginning of each year is primarily attributable to an increase during those periods in the supply of available rooms in the lodging industry and specifically in certain of the markets in which we operate 
the impact of the additional supply of rooms was offset by the impact of a decline in the ratio of newly opened properties to total properties 
for the extended stay brand  occupancy rates increased for as compared to primarily due to a decrease in the ratio of newly opened properties to total properties for that brand 
occupancy rates decreased for the crossland brand primarily due to an increase in the number of newly opened properties for that brand 
occupancy rates for the studioplus brand were also diluted by an increase in the number of newly opened properties for that brand 
in addition  the studioplus properties opened before experienced average declines in occupancy rates of approximately five percentage points 
we believe that this decline was due to a number of factors  including primarily a change in the pricing policies for the studioplus brand during to eliminate certain rate discounts  changes in personnel as a result of management restructuring following the merger with sph  and additional competition from new properties that we and our competitors have opened in the markets served by these properties 
the increase in overall average weekly room rates for compared to reflects the geographic dispersion of properties opened during and the higher standard weekly room rates in certain of those markets 
the increase also is due in part to increases in rates charged in previously opened properties

property operating expenses were million of total revenue for compared to million of total revenue for the decrease in property operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for as compared to was primarily a result of a decrease in the ratio of newly opened properties to total properties 
as a result  our property operating margins were for and for the provisions for depreciation and amortization for the lodging facilities were million for and million for depreciation and amortization for increased compared to because we operated additional facilities in and because we operated for a full year the properties that were opened in corporate operations we incurred corporate operating and property management expenses of million of total revenue in and million of total revenue in the increase in the amount of these expenses for as compared to reflects the impact of additional personnel and related expenses in connection with the increased number of facilities we operated and sites we developed 
depreciation and amortization for assets not directly related to operation of our facilities was million for and million for we realized million of interest income during and million during this interest income was primarily attributable to the temporary investment of funds drawn under our credit facilities and funds received from an offering of common stock in the decrease in interest income for as compared to was due to the decrease in our average cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of our continued investments in property and equipment during we incurred interest charges of million during and million during of these amounts  million during and million during was capitalized and included in the cost of buildings and improvements 
we recognized income tax expense of million of income before taxes for and million of income before taxes for our income tax expense differs from the federal income tax rate of primarily due to state and local income taxes and  for  due to permanent tax differences relating to merger expenses and tax exempt interest income 
other charges income our normal operating procedures call for us to invest varying amounts in our sites under option in terms of earnest money which would be applied to the purchase of a site  but that in certain circumstances may not be refundable  legal  environmental  engineering  and architectural outlays needed to determine the feasibility of acquiring a site and constructing a hotel on that site  and salaries  wages  and travel costs of our personnel related to the sites 
we capitalize these expenses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in the quarter ended september   we announced a reduction in our development plans for and as a result of unfavorable capital market conditions 
this meant that certain sites we had under option would not be developed 
as a result  we established a valuation allowance of million for the write off of expenses related to these sites 
this resulted in a corresponding expense during the quarter ended september  at december   a total of million of those costs  including  in termination payments to employees  had been charged against the allowance and million was included in other current liabilities 
we believe that these charges are non recurring in nature and will not affect the future results of operations 
during  we recorded merger  financing  and other charges totaling million 
these pre tax charges consisted of i million of merger expenses and costs associated with the integration of sph s operations following the merger  ii the write off of million of deferred costs associated with two mortgage loan facilities  which were terminated upon execution of a revolving credit facility  and iii a charge of  in connection with moving the listing of our common stock to the nyse from the national market tier of the nasdaq stock market 
we believe that these charges are non recurring in nature and will not affect the future results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we had net cash and cash equivalents of million at december  and million as of december  at december  we had approximately  invested and at december  we had approximately million invested in short term demand notes having credit ratings of a pl or equivalent using domestic commercial banks and other financial institutions 
we also deposited excess funds during these periods in an overnight sweep account with a commercial bank which in turn invested those funds in short term  interest bearing reverse repurchase agreements 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we did not take possession of the securities  which were instead held by the financial institutions 
the market value of the securities held pursuant to these arrangements approximates the carrying amount 
deposits in excess of  are not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
our operating activities generated cash of million in  million in  and million in we used million to acquire land and develop and furnish sites opened or under construction in  million for sites in  and million for sites in our cost to develop a property varies significantly by brand and by geographic location due to differences in land and labor costs 
similarly  the average weekly rate charged and the resultant cash flow from these properties will vary significantly but generally are expected to be in proportion to the development costs 
for the properties we opened from january  through december   the average development cost was approximately million with an average of rooms 
in  we opened a number of properties in the northeast and west where average development costs are higher  resulting in average development costs for of million per property 
we expect our average development cost per property for to continue to increase to approximately million per property as we continue to expand in the northeast and west 
we received net proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase common stock totaling million in  million in  and million in additionally  in  we sold million shares of common stock in a private placement transaction resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
we made open market repurchases of  shares of common stock for approximately million in and  shares of common stock for approximately million in in september  we executed an agreement with various banks establishing a credit facility that provided for up to million of revolving loans on a senior collateralized basis that had a maturity of december  to be used for general corporate purposes  including the construction and acquisition of extended stay properties 
upon entering into the revolving credit facility  we terminated two mortgage loan facilities  which had provided for an aggregate of million in mortgage loans 
we recorded a pre tax charge of million at that time  which represented the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the mortgage loan facilities 
in march  we amended the revolving credit facility and  as amended  it became the credit facility 
the credit facility was again amended in september and december the credit facility provides for a million revolving loan facility the revolving facility  a million term loan facility the tranche a facility  a million term loan facility the tranche b facility  and a million term loan facility the tranche c facility 
as of december   we had outstanding loans of million under the revolving facility and million  net of scheduled principal repayments of million in  under the term loans  leaving million available and committed under the credit facility 
availability of the revolving facility is dependent  however  upon us satisfying certain financial ratios of debt and interest compared to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  with these amounts being calculated pursuant to definitions contained in the credit facility 
loans under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at either a prime based rate base rate or a libor based rate eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is an annual rate that fluctuates based on our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility 
the applicable margin for the various loan facilities in the credit facility are shown in the table below base rate eurodollar rate revolving facility tranche a facility tranche b facility tranche c facility the loans under the revolving facility and the tranche a facility mature on december  the loans under the tranche b facility and the tranche c facility mature on december  and  respectively  but are subject to principal payments of of the initial loan amounts in each of the years through for the tranche b facility and through for the tranche c facility 
the remaining balances must be repaid in four equal quarterly installments in the years of maturity 
our obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries 
they are also collateralized by a first priority lien on all stock of our subsidiaries and all other current and future assets owned by us and our subsidiaries other than mortgages on our real property 
the credit facility contains a number of negative covenants  including  among others  covenants that limit our ability to incur debt  make investments  pay dividends  prepay other indebtedness  engage in transactions with affiliates  enter into sale leaseback transactions  create liens  make capital expenditures  acquire or dispose of assets  or engage in mergers or acquisitions 
in addition  the credit facility contains affirmative covenants  including  among others  covenants that require us to maintain our corporate existence  comply with laws  maintain our properties and insurance  and deliver financial and other information to the lenders 
the credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial tests and to maintain certain financial ratios on a consolidated basis 
our primary market risk exposures result from the variable nature of the interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility 
we entered into the credit facility for purposes other than trading 
we do not own derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
based on the levels of borrowings under the credit facility at december   if interest rates changed by  our annual cash flow and net income would change by million 
we manage our market risk exposures by periodic evaluation of such exposures relative to the costs of reducing the exposures by entering into interest rate swaps or by refinancing the underlying obligations with longer term fixed rate debt obligations 
on march   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes the notes 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of  payable semiannually on march and september of each year and mature on march  we may redeem the notes beginning on march  the initial redemption price is of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
the redemption price declines each year after and is of their principal amount  plus accrued interest  after in addition  before march   we may redeem up to million of the notes  using the proceeds from certain sales of our stock  at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
the notes are uncollateralized and are subordinated to all of our senior indebtedness including the credit facility  and contain certain covenants for the benefit of the holders of the notes 
these covenants  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends and make investments and other restricted payments  enter into transactions with stockholders or affiliates  create liens  and sell assets 
in connection with the credit facility and the notes  we incurred additions to deferred loan costs of  during  million during  and million during we had commitments not reflected in our financial statements at december  totaling approximately million to complete construction of extended stay properties 
we expect we will have sufficient funds to open properties with total costs exceeding million in due to uncertainties regarding the availability of additional capital for projects opening in  however  we plan to limit the development of properties opening in to approximately properties with total costs of approximately million 
we believe that this strategy will permit us to develop properties in markets with higher barriers to entry that generally have longer development cycles  while prudently managing our capital structure 
in the event we obtain additional capital  we will seek to increase property openings in future years 
we believe that the remaining availability under the credit facility  together with cash on hand and cash flows from operations  will provide sufficient funds to continue our expansion as presently planned and to fund our operating expenses through we may need additional capital depending on a number of factors  including the number of properties we construct or acquire  the timing of that development  and the cash flow generated by our properties 
also  if capital markets provide favorable opportunities  our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  our existing sources of funds prove to be insufficient to fund our growth and operations  or if we consummate acquisitions  we may seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
sources of capital may include public or private debt or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
our failure to raise additional capital could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of our development and expansion plans  and could have a material adverse effect on us 
seasonality and inflation based upon the operating history of our facilities  we believe that extended stay lodging facilities are not as seasonal in nature as the overall lodging industry 
we do expect  however  that our occupancy rates and revenues will be lower than average during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year 
because many of our expenses do not fluctuate with changes in occupancy rates  declines in occupancy rates may cause fluctuations or decreases in our quarterly earnings 
the rate of inflation as measured by changes in the average consumer price index has not had a material effect on our revenue or operating results during any of the periods presented 
we cannot assure you  however  that inflation will not affect our future operating or construction costs
