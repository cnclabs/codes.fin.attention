overview we are a leading provider of broadband digital access equipment solutions to communications service providers  including competitive local exchange carriers  incumbent local exchange carriers  independent operating companies  internet service providers  interexchange carriers and wireless mobility service providers 
carrier access products are used for the provisioning of enhanced voice and high speed data and internet services by service providers to businesses  government and enterprise end users 
carrier access corporation s access bank  wide bank  access navigator and cactus family products are connected to t  high bit rate digital subscriber line  digital radio  t and optical access and transport networks 
our digital equipment provides a last mile solution for the distribution and management of high bandwidth services from carriers throughout the united states 
reaching large numbers of consumers using voice and high speed internet access requires connectivity from service providers to end users 
installation of our central office communications and customer located voice and data communications equipment enables this connectivity 
our products allow service providers to cost effectively connect end users to their network products  decrease ongoing transmission equipment and maintenance expenses  while enabling new service delivery  such as integrated voice and high speed internet access 
our products enable high bandwidth digital deployments targeted at end users requiring between four and telephone and data line equivalents of bandwidth 
we believe that over service providers and other end users have purchased our products directly or through our distributors 
we were incorporated in september as a successor company to koenig communications  an equipment systems integration and consulting company which had been in operation since in the summer of  we ceased our systems integration and consulting business and commenced our main product sales with the introduction of the access bank product family 
in the fourth quarter of  we began commercial deployment of our wide bank product family and in january of  we began commercial deployment of our access navigator product family 
in december we began deployment of the cactus family of products 
accordingly  we have only a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
our net revenue is derived from the sales of broadband digital access equipment and accessories 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of product from our factory to our distributors warehouses and direct customers 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  our access bank product family and the wide bank product family accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net revenue 
in  our access bank product family  wide bank product family and access navigator product family accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our net revenue 
most of the sales of our products have historically been through distributors 
our distributors are responsible for warehousing product and fulfilling product orders as well as identifying potential service provider customers and  in some cases  customizing and integrating our products at end users sites 
as a result  our success depends on maintaining good relations with our distributors 
sales of our products historically have been made to a limited number of distributors 
in  walker  adc and phillips accounted for  and of net revenue  respectively 
in  walker  phillips and telsource accounted for  and of net revenue  respectively 
in  walker and adc accounted for and of net revenue  respectively 
we expect that sales of our products will continue to be made to a small number of key page of distributors 
accordingly  the loss of  or reduction in sales to  any of our key distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  significant portions of the sales of our products are currently being made through direct sales 
as a result  our continued success depends on building and maintaining good relations with our direct customers 
we have limited knowledge of the financial condition of certain of our customers 
however  we are aware that some of our customers have limited financial and other resources which could impair their ability to pay us  although the financial instability of these customers has not limited any customer s ability to pay us for our products to date 
while we believe we have adequately provided for uncollectable accounts  we cannot assure you that any bad debts that we incur will not exceed our reserves or that the financial instability of one or more of our customers will not harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
any reduction in planned purchases by our customers in the future could harm our business 
in addition  we grant certain of our customers most favored customer terms  pursuant to which we have agreed to not knowingly provide another customer with similar terms and conditions or a better price than those provided to the existing customer  without offering the more favorable prices to the existing customer 
it is possible that these price protection and most favored customer clauses could cause a material decrease in the average selling prices and gross margins of our products  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
currently  our customers do not have any obligation to purchase additional products 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that present or future direct customers will not terminate their purchasing arrangements with us  or that they will not significantly reduce or delay the amount of our products that they order 
any such termination  change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition to being dependent on a small number of distributors and direct customers for a majority of our net revenue  we believe our products are distributed to a limited number of competitive service provider customers who are primarily competitive local exchange carriers 
we believe that in  thirty five service provider customers  indirectly  accounted for of our net revenue and that in  approximately seventy five service provider customers  indirectly  accounted for of our net revenue 
in particular  we believe that two of these service provider customers each accounted for more than of our net revenue in none of these customers has any obligation to purchase additional products or services 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their purchasing arrangements with us or our distributors or significantly reduce or delay the amount of our products that they order 
any such termination  change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we generally provide our distributors with limited stock rotation and price protection rights  and we have granted certain of our distributors most favored customer terms 
there can be no assurance that these stock rotation rights  price protection rights or most favored customer provisions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we believe that average selling prices and gross margins for our products will decline as such products mature  as volume price discounts in distributor contracts take effect and as competition intensifies  among other factors 
in  we reduced the price of our access bank products  and we expect to make further price reductions in with respect to certain access bank and wide bank products 
in addition  discounts to distributors and direct customers vary among product lines and are based on volume shipments  both of which affect gross margins 
we believe our gross margins are likely to fluctuate based on product and channel mix 
margins will also likely be reduced from time to time by new product introductions 
results of operations year ended december  in thousands  except percentages and per share amounts net revenue    gross margin as a percentage of revenue net income available to common stockholders   income per share diluted for  our net revenue increased to million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
for  our net income available to common stockholders increased to million from million and  for the years ended december  and respectively 
these increases in net revenue and net income available to common stockholders were due to a significant increase in the sale of all products  including the access navigator product family  enhancements to existing products and increased acceptance of the wide bank product family 
our gross margin was   and for the years ended december    and respectively 
contributing to higher net income for was a substantial increase in revenue  gross margin and other income primarily interest income  partially offset by increased operating expenses 
page of net revenue and cost of goods sold year ended december  dollars in thousands net revenue    cost of goods sold    net revenue for was million 
this represented an increase of million or from the million of net revenue in the increase was due to the introduction of new products  primarily the access navigator in january  along with increases in the sale of existing products to distributors and other direct customers 
net revenue increased to in from million in  representing an increase of million or 
these increases were attributable to the increased sales of existing products and enhancements in the access bank and wide bank product families 
we anticipate that sales for the wide bank and access navigator product families will increase at a greater rate than the access bank product family 
the cactus product family was introduced in december and we believe trial and evaluations of this product will convert into customer sales in the timing and quantities of orders for our products may vary from quarter to quarter in the future 
this is due to factors such as demand for the products and ordering patterns of distributors and other direct customers 
we believe that this trend will continue in the future  especially if the percentage of direct sales to end users increases 
the timing of customer orders and our ability to fulfill them can cause material fluctuations in our operating results  we anticipate that such fluctuations will occur 
during  the majority of sales of our products were made through distributors 
our success depends in part on the continued sales and customer support efforts of our network of distributors and increasing our sales to our direct customers 
in  walker and adc accounted for and respectively  of net revenue 
we expect that the sale of our products will continue to be made to a small number of distributors and other direct customers 
accordingly  the loss of  or a reduction in sales to  any of our key distributors or key direct customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to being dependent on a small number of distributors for a majority of our net revenue  we believe that our products are distributed to a limited number of service provider customers who are primarily competitive local exchange carriers 
in  we believe  based on information provided to us by our distributors  that two of these end user customers purchases were in excess of of our revenue 
costs of goods sold increased to million for compared to million for and million in in each year  the increase was primarily attributable to increased product shipments  partially offset by cost reductions in existing product platforms 
year ended december  dollars in thousands gross profit    gross margin our gross profit for was million 
this represents an increase of million or from the gross profit of million 
gross margin increased to in from in the increase in gross profit was driven primarily by increased product shipments and cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies 
the increase in gross margin percentage were principally due to material cost reductions for the existing product lines in addition to increases in manufacturing efficiencies generated by greater production volumes 
gross profit was approximately million in  an increase from million in this increase was caused by the increased shipments of our products partially offset by cost reductions 
gross margins for and were and  respectively 
we believe that gross margins will decline if pricing declines occur in our product families at a greater rate than anticipated cost reductions 
new product introductions could also harm gross margins until production volumes increase 
we believe that average selling prices and gross margins for our products will decline as such products mature  as volume price discounts in distributor contracts and direct sales relationships take effect and as competition intensifies  among other factors 
in addition  discounts to distributors vary among product lines and are based on volume shipments  both of which affect gross margins 
our gross margins vary between product families 
as a result  we believe that our gross margins are likely to fluctuate in the future based on product mix and channel mix 
margins will likely be reduced from time to time by new product introductions by us and our competitors 
page of research and development expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands research and development expenses    as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses increased to million for from million for this increase of million or was primarily due to an increase in the number of personnel engaged in the development of new products  specifically the inloop rt and the cactus programs  the addition of a research and development facility in tulsa  oklahoma and personnel added for enhancing our existing products 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million for this increase of million or was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of personnel engaged in the development of new products  primarily the access navigator as well as enhancements developed for the existing product families 
expenditures for prototyping and regulatory compliance also contributed to the increase  although to a much lesser extent 
we expect the amount of research and development will increase in  especially the first half of  to fund the development of new products and enhancements for existing product platforms and the possible additional new research and development facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands sales and marketing expenses    general and administrative expenses    total selling  general and administrative expenses    as a percentage of net revenue selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in for we had selling  general and administrative expenses totaling million 
this represented an increase of million or 
marketing expense increases reflected increased hiring and marketing activity with respect to the introduction of the access navigator  inloop rt and cactus product families  customer support  advertising and trade shows 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was the result of our expanded sales and marketing activities and an increase in the size of the sales force and a corresponding increase in sales salaries  bonuses and commissions 
we have hired and intend to continue to hire additional sales and marketing personnel and to continue to aggressively pursue sales and marketing campaigns 
we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future 
we also expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the expansion of our business and incur increased costs in connection with the administration of multiple facilities 
stock based compensation as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we account for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
since inception  we have generally granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock  as determined by our board of directors and based on our other equity transactions 
during and the six months ended june   we granted options to employees with exercise prices less than the fair value per share based upon our previous preferred stock offerings and the estimated price per share in the initial public offering 
accordingly  we have recorded deferred compensation expense totaling approximately million 
such compensation expense will be recognized pro rata over the month vesting period of the options 
this deferred compensation expense totaled approximately   and  for  and related compensation expense will total approximately  for each of the years ended december  and it is our intention to generally grant future stock options with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and account for such grants in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
interest and other income interest and other income increased to million in from million in this increase of million was due to interest income earned on higher cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest and other income increased to million in from  in the increase was primarily due interest earned on the proceeds of the initial public offering and cash reserves generated by operations 
page of income taxes for  our effective combined federal and state income tax rate was  compared to for in both and we realized a benefit from research and development tax credits and non taxable interest income 
we had a combined income tax rate in of 
we expect our effective tax rate to remain in the to range in the future if tax laws and rates do not materially change 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations to date primarily through cash generated from operations  sales of common and preferred stock and periodic borrowings under our credit facilities 
as of december  in thousands working capital   cash  cash equivalents and securities   total assets   years ended december  in thousands net cash provided used by operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    cash flows net cash provided by operating activities for totaled approximately million  while operating activities in generated approximately million of net cash 
cash provided by operating activities in was mainly due to net income  the tax benefit relating to the exercise of stock options and an increase in accounts payable  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventory and prepaid expenses 
we anticipate that increased sales to direct customers could increase days sales outstanding and therefore accounts receivable balances could increase in the future 
cash provided by operating activities in was mainly due to net income and increases in accrued liabilities  and was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable 
cash used by operating activities in was primarily due to increases in inventory and accounts receivable  partially offset by net income and increases in accounts payable 
our inventory levels increased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  the increase was due primarily to a decision to maintain higher inventory balances for finished goods in order to fulfill potential customer requirements 
cash used by investing activities was approximately million for year ended december  and approximately million for cash used by investing activities in both years was primarily the result of purchasing us government agency and corporate bonds with maturities greater than three months 
our capital expenditures for were million for additions to facilities and equipment to support our research  development and manufacturing activities  compared to million for we anticipate that we will need to expand our facilities in our current and other locations to accommodate hiring additional personnel throughout the year to support ongoing operations 
cash used by investing activities was approximately million for  related primarily to purchases of us government agency and corporate bonds with maturities greater than three months and capital expenditures for additions to facilities and equipment to support our research  development and manufacturing activities 
we intend to continue to significantly increase our capital expenditures in and thereafter for additions to facilities and equipment to support our research  development and manufacturing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for and million for cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to the exercise of stock options 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering 
net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock resulted in the cash provided from financing activities in liquidity at december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and marketable securities available for sale of approximately million and an unsecured bank credit facility of million  which bears interest either the prime rate or at the libor rate plus basis points 
this working capital line of credit is limited to a borrowing base determined by the balance of our eligible receivables and inventory 
at december   there was million outstanding under the working capital line 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
page of at december   our working capital was approximately million and had increased to million at december  we have no significant capital spending or purchase commitments other than normal inventory purchase commitments under facilities leases 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our existing cash  investment balances  and our line of credit are adequate to fund our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent we experience growth in the future  we anticipate that our investing activities may use cash 
should the need arise  we believe we would be able to borrow additional funds or otherwise raise additional capital  however  there can be no assurance that additional funds or capital will be available in adequate amounts and on terms reasonably acceptable to us 
we may consider using our capital to make strategic investments or to acquire or license technology or products 
we may also enter into strategic alliances with third parties that could provide access to additional capital 
any such activities could require us to obtain additional financing
