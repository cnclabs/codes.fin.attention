liquidity and capital resources inventories consist mainly of finished hyaluronan powder and oral restorative products and related raw materials 
the portion of finished hyaluronan inventory that is not expected to be consumed within the next twelve months is classified as long term 
the finished hyaluronan inventory is maintained in a frozen state and has a shelf life in excess of five years 
total inventory decreased slightly in fiscal as the company shut down production of hyaluronan powder and intergel solution after the january fda advisory panel meeting 
inventory increased  or in fiscal from fiscal principally due to building of hyaluronan inventory levels in anticipation of the demand for intergel solution 
while the company had positive cash flow from operations in fiscal  the company had significant operating cash flow deficits in fiscal years and as the hyaluronan division s production levels increase  its related production efficiencies will increase 
however  charges for unused capacity associated with the company s hyaluronan production have negatively impacted operating results in the fiscal these charges are a result of an unanticipated delay in receiving intergel solution marketing approval in the us from the fda 
the company expects that its hyaluronan division gross margins will continue to be negatively impacted until marketing approval for intergel solution is achieved 
also  marketing and sales expenses for the oral restorative products are expected to continue at a high level  and personnel costs have increased 
the ongoing research  development and pma process costs for intergel solution will continue for the foreseeable future

during fiscal and  the company expanded its manufacturing and distribution capabilities at its chaska  minnesota location 
the expansion included building and equipment expenditures for warehouse and distribution capabilities and to scale up aseptic packaging facilities for finished products 
the expansion totaled approximately million and was completed in june the expansion was funded from the proceeds of investment maturities 
this expansion provides future capacity  but increases the level of fixed charges to be absorbed by operations 
the company s ability to generate positive cash flow from operations and achieve ongoing profitability is dependent upon the continued expansion of revenue from its hyaluronan and oral restorative businesses 
growth in the hyaluronan division is unpredictable due to the complex governmental regulatory environment for new medical products and the early stage of certain of these markets 
similarly  expansion of the company s oral restorative division sales is also dependent upon increased revenue from new and existing customers  as well as successfully competing in a more mature market 
with the completion of the facility expansion  the company expects its cash generated from anticipated operations and the availability of the line of credit to satisfy cash flow needs in the near term 
no assurance can be given that the company will attain and maintain positive cash flow before its capital resources are exhausted 
while the company s capital resources appear adequate today  the company may seek additional financing in the future
