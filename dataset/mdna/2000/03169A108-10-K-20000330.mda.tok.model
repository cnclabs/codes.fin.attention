statements which use the words expects  will  may  anticipates  goal  intends  seeks  strategy and derivatives of such words are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements  including statements regarding changes in the company s future income  mortgage asset portfolio  financings  plans to create origination capability  ways the company may seek to grow income  management expectations regarding future provisions for loan losses  and the company s belief in the adequacy of loan losses  are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statement 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the factors set forth under item under the heading business risks 
in particular  the company s future income could be affected by interest rate increases  high levels of prepayments  mortgage loan defaults  reductions in the value of retained interest in securitizations  and inability to acquire or finance new mortgage assets 
overview the company s revenue primarily consists of interest income generated from its mortgage assets and its cash and investment balances collectively  earning assets  income generated by equity in income of american residential holdings  inc  management fees  and prepayment penalty income 
the company funds its acquisitions of earning assets with both its equity capital and with borrowings 
for that portion of the company s earning assets funded with equity capital equity funded lending  net interest income is derived from the average yield on earning assets 
due to the adjustable rate nature of the majority of its earning assets  the company expects that income from this source will tend to increase as interest rates rise and will tend to decrease as interest rates fall  but only after the expiration of any initial fixed teaser periods and then only periodically once or twice each year 
for that portion of the company s earning assets funded with borrowings spread lending  the resulting net interest income is a function of the volume of spread lending and the difference between the company s average yield on earning assets and the cost of borrowed funds 
income from spread lending will generally decrease following an increase in short term interest rates due to increases in borrowing costs but a lag in adjustments to the earning asset yields 
yields on adjustable rate loans generally adjust based on a short term interest rate index  but the majority of the company s earning assets are adjustable rate loans which are subject to an initial fixed teaser period of years  and then adjust periodically every six months 
income from spread lending will generally increase following a fall in short term interest rates as borrowing costs decline and downward adjustments to earning asset yields lag behind 
the company purchases interest rate cap agreements to partially offset the impacts of significant increases in short term interest rates and the loss of spread income which occurs when borrowing rates which generally adjust monthly increase more than earning asset yields which generally adjust only after the expiration of any fixed teaser periods and then only periodically  once or twice a year 
the company s primary expenses  beside its borrowing costs  are amortization of loan purchase premiums  provision for loan losses  management and administrative expenses and hedging costs 
premiums are amortized in relation to actual portfolio repayments on each segment of the portfolio  so the level of premium amortization expense is linked to the amount of capitalized loan purchase premiums for each portfolio and the level of repayments in each portfolio group 
management fees and administrative costs are generally based on the size of the earning asset portfolio  and to a lesser degree  the level of loan purchase activity 
hedging costs are based on size of the portfolio subject to gap risk and the market prices for interest rate cap agreements 
during the fourth quarter of the company recorded approximately million write down of its bond collateral  mortgage loans 
the write down was related to a particular segment of the portfolio that had been purchased at a significant premium and subsequently experienced high prepayments 
this write down generated a net loss for of approximately million but served to reduce the un amortized premiums on the portfolio from at december  to at december  the company may seek to generate growth in net income in a variety of ways  including through i improving productivity by increasing the size of the earning assets  ii changing the mix of mortgage asset types among the earning assets and lowering premiums paid in an effort to improve returns and reduce the company s sensitivity to prepayments  issuing new common stock and increasing the size of the earning assets  and iii increasing the efficiency with which the company uses its equity capital over time by maintaining the company s use of debt when prudent and by issuing subordinated debt  preferred stock or other forms of debt and equity 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s efforts will be successful or that the company will increase or maintain its income level 
results of operations for the year ended december  the company generated a net loss of approximately million and net loss per share of common stock diluted of compared to the year ended december  when the company generated a net loss of approximately million and net loss per share of common stock diluted of 
for the period february  commencement of operations through december  the company generated net income of approximately million and diluted net income per share of 
the net loss in was directly attributable to the write down of premium on bond collateral  mortgage loans in the amount of approximately million 
these loans were purchased in when non conforming loans were selling significantly above par 
the net loss in was directly attributable to the loss on sale of mortgage securities available for sale and the provision for loan losses 
due to market conditions in  ie high prepayments  fueled by declining interest rates and the need to lower leverage  the majority of the company s mortgage securities available for sale were sold during the fourth quarter of this sale resulted in a loss of approximately million 
the growth in mortgage asset interest income of million and net interest spread of million between the years ended december  and was primarily due to an increase in the company s mortgage assets held during the year  higher asset yields due to a change in the composition of mortgage assets  and  relative to net interest spread  offset by higher interest expense associated with an increase in borrowings and an increase in borrowing rates during the second half of the growth in mortgage asset interest income of million and net interest spread of million between the year ended december  and the period february  commencement of operations through december   was also due to an increase in the company s mortgage assets held during the period and higher asset yields due to a change in the composition of mortgage assets 
net interest income decreased million between the years ended december  and due to higher premium amortization and premium write downs  offset by the increase in net interest spread 
net interest income increased million between the year ended december  and the period february  commencement of operations through december  this increase was due to an increase in the company s mortgage assets held during the year 
premium amortization expense represents the amortization of purchase premiums paid for mortgage loans acquired in excess of the par value of the loans 
actual repayment rates the amount of principal repayments during a period compared to the beginning principal balance are applied to the remaining unamortized premium to calculate amortization expense 
premium amortization expense was approximately million for the year ended december   approximately million for the year ended december   and approximately million for the period from february  commencement of operations through december  higher premium amortization expense is due to growth in bond collateral and associated amortization of related purchase premiums and higher levels of repayments in the cmo fasit segment of the bond collateral portfolio  the oldest and most expensive portion of mortgage loans 
additionally  increased levels of prepayments in the fourth quarter of on the cmo fasit segment of bond collateral  mortgage loans lead to a premium write down of million in the fourth quarter of the following chart represents constant repayment rates cprs cpr rates december  lifetime six months three months bond collateral cmo fasit cmo cmo cmo remic a cpr rates december  lifetime six months three months bond collateral cmo fasit at december   unamortized premiums as a percentage of the remaining principal amount of bond collateral  mortgage loans were  as compared to at december   primarily due to the writedown of premium on the cmo fasit portfolio 
the chart below provides a breakdown of prepayment coverage and the weighted average months remaining until the next interest rate adjustment for each segment of the mortgage loan portfolio as of december  weighted weighted percentage of average months average loans with remaining on months until principal prepayment prepayment initial interest balance penalties coverage rate adjustment dollars in thousands mortgage loans held for investment  bond collateral  mortgage loans cmo fasit  cmo  cmo  cmo remic a  prepayment coverage is the number of months remaining before the prepayment clause in the mortgage loan contracts expire and borrowers may prepay the loan without prepayment penalty charges 
most of the intermediate adjustable rate mortgages in the cmo fasit segment of the bond collateral portfolio have reached their first contractual interest rate adjustment increase and prepayment penalties on these loans have expired  resulting in a higher probability of refinancing and principal prepayments 
the company anticipates that prepayment rates on the newer mortgage loans will increase as these predominately adjustable rate loans reach their initial adjustments or when prepayment penalty clauses expire 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or maintain lower prepayment rates or that prepayment rates will not increase 
the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if prepayments continue at high levels 
net interest income  after premium amortization  premium write down and provision for loan losses  decreased from approximately million in income for the year ended december  to a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  due primarily to higher premium amortization and the premium write down of approximately million  offset by higher net interest spread discussed above 
net interest income  after premium amortization and provision for loan losses  increased from million for the period february  commencement of operations through december   to million for the year ended december   offset by higher premium amortization and provision for loan loss  due to increases in net interest spread 
during  other operating income increased approximately million over the year ended december  primarily due to an increase of approximately million in prepayment penalty income  and an increase in the size of the mortgage loan portfolio and the proportion of loans with prepayment penalties 
this increase was offset by a decrease in equity in income of american residential holdings  inc of approximately  this decrease is due to the fact that no loan sales occurred in compared to a sale and remic securitization in by american residential holdings  inc during  the company generated prepayment penalty income of approximately  and management fee income of approximately  there was no income from prepayment penalty or management fees for the period february  commencement of operations through december  for the year ended december   other expenses increased approximately million excluding the loss on sale of mortgage securities available for sale of approximately million in over the year ended december  during there was a loss on the sale of real estate owned of  and management fees increased approximately million as a result of the company s increase in mortgage loans
