liquidity and capital resources our cash needs are primarily for working capital to support our inventory requirements and capital expenditures  pre opening expenses and beginning inventory for new stores and for remodeling or relocating older stores 
additionally  we pursue an active acquisition strategy  and capital needs are created as acquisition opportunities are pursued 
historically  our primary sources of financing have been net cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  and proceeds from the sale of equity or subordinated notes 
at september  and september   our working capital was million and million  respectively 
the increase was mainly due to the february offering 
cash provided by operations was million for the year ended september  this was a result of million in net income  depreciation and amortization of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and an increase in customer deposits of million 
this was offset by increases in inventory of million and accounts receivable of million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  as well as minor changes in other operating accounts 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was approximately million 
approximately million was used to fund acquisitions  and million was used to open ten new stores and relocate one store 
in addition  million was used for new stores to be opened or relocated after fiscal the balance of million was used for other miscellaneous capital expenditures for equipment  fixtures and leasehold improvements 
during fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and was used to fund acquisitions  open five new stores  relocate three stores and other capital expenditures for 
table of contents equipment  fixtures and leasehold improvements 
there are no other material commitments for capital expenditures other than new store openings and remodeling or relocating existing stores in the next months 
at september   we had no outstanding balance under our credit facility 
the credit facility currently has a maximum availability of million and a maturity date of july   and is secured by our inventory and certain other of our assets 
we are currently negotiating a new credit facility and expect this new facility to be in place before the expiration of the current facility  under substantially the same terms 
on february   we completed an offering of  shares of common stock 
we sold  shares and  shares were sold by our existing shareholders 
we received net proceeds of approximately million and used these net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under our revolving credit facility of million  and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
we believe that cash expected to be generated from operations  and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  exclusive of acquisitions  for at least the next months 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  we cannot predict accurately the effect of inflation on future operating results 
seasonality our business is subject to seasonal variations 
historically  we have realized a significant portion of our total revenue and net income for the year during the first and fourth fiscal quarters  with a majority of net income for such quarters realized in the first fiscal quarter 
due to the importance of the holiday shopping season  any factors negatively impacting the holiday selling season could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including the timing of new store openings and acquisitions and unexpected changes in volume related rebates or changes in cooperative advertising policies from manufacturers 
in addition  operating results may be negatively affected by increases in merchandise costs  price changes in response to competitive factors and unfavorable local  regional or national economic developments that result in reduced consumer spending
