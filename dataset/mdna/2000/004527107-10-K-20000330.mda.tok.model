stock offering 
during the third quarter of  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock pursuant to an underwritten public offering 
as with many media companies  our acquisitions and dispositions have resulted in significant non cash and non recurring charges to income 
for this reason  in addition to net income  our management believes that operating cash flow defined as net revenue less operating expenses before amortization  depreciation  interest  litigation  and stock compensation expenses and net gain on dispositions of assets is an appropriate measure of our financial performance 
similarly  we believe that segment operating cash flow defined as operating cash flow before corporate overhead is an appropriate measure of our segments financial performance 
these measures exclude certain expenses that management does not consider to be costs of ongoing operations 
we use operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on our long term debt as well as to finance capital expenditures 
operating cash flow and segment operating cash flow  however  are not to be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity

on august   we received proceeds of million upon the termination of an interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal amount of million

this forward looking statement is  however  subject to the qualification set forth under forward looking statements above 
for the periods presented  we financed our working capital needs primarily from cash provided by operating activities and bank borrowings

year the year or yk problem is a result of the inability of computer software programs to recognize the year  as most programs and systems were designed to store calendar years in the s by assuming the and storing only the last two digits of the year 
as we have reported in the past  we have spent considerable effort in preparing for yk in the period leading up to january  we have not experienced any significant yk problems and have not been informed of any material yk problems by our customers or vendors 
however  although january  is past  it is possible that some problems have gone undetected  or that other dates in the future may further affect computer software and systems  or equipment with embedded chip technology 
we will continue to monitor the yk compliance of our own computer systems and equipment with embedded technology  as well as any yk related problems that may be reported to us by third parties with whom we do business 
as discussed in our form q for the fiscal quarter ended september   the estimated costs of remediation associated with the yk issue were  we believe  based on our review of such costs to march   that total remediation costs will not be materially higher than the amount previously estimated 
however  as noted above  it is possible that additional costs will be incurred in connection with yk problems that may still occur in the future 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in libor and us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our debt 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  we generally maintain a portion of our debt as fixed rate in nature either by borrowing on a long term basis or entering into interest rate swap transactions 
the table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  which consist of interest rate swaps and debt obligations for the years ended december  and for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts
