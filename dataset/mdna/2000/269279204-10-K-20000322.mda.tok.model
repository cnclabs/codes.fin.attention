our other income in was  as compared to  in this income primarily includes interest income  salt water disposal income  and well supervision fees 
other income increased due primarily to a  increase in interest income which we received from cash equivalent investments and an additional  in income we received from our two salt water disposal wells 
we have reclassified amounts in the prior years statements of operations to reflect a change in the way we classify fees from overhead charges billed to working interest owners  including ourselves 
we previously recorded these overhead charges as management fee revenue  and we now record them as a reduction in general and administrative expenses 
costs and expenses 
our costs and expenses increased million  or  to million in as compared to costs and expenses of  in our costs and expenses primarily increased due to a  increase in general and administrative costs 
this increase reflects expenses associated with our increased staffing and our new focus on reserve acquisitions 
our costs and expenses also increased due to a  increase in oil and natural gas production expenses and a  increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  both increases due to our acquisitions 
we also had an increase of  in interest expense as a result of periodic borrowings against our credit facility 
in  we changed our method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties from successful efforts to the full cost method of accounting 
we have restated prior years to reflect this change in accounting method as though we had been using the full cost method for all periods we are comparing in this annual report 
effective december   we effected a quasi reorganization by applying approximately million of our additional paid in capital account to eliminate our accumulated deficit 
net loss 
we had a net loss in of  or 
per share  compared to a loss of  or 
per share in we have based our earnings per share figures on restated weighted average shares outstanding after the retroactive effect of the one for two reverse stock split approved at our shareholders meeting held on march  quasi reorganization effective december   we effected a quasi reorganization by applying approximately million of our additional paid in capital account to eliminate our accumulated deficit 
our board of directors decided to effect this quasi reorganization given the change in management in december  the infusion of new equity capital during december and an expected increase in acquisition  exploitation and development activities 
based on these factors and the establishment of a strategic growth plan  our board of directors and management believed reflecting prior losses on our balance sheet would not be meaningful in presenting our financial position 
our accumulated deficit was primarily related to past operations and properties that had been disposed of  the accumulated deficit was not  in management s view  reflective of our financial condition at that time 
we did not adjust the historical carrying values of our assets and liabilities in connection with the quasi reorganization 
we changed our method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations in the fourth quarter of  we changed from the successful efforts method to the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas operations 
we have restated all of the prior financial statements which we present in this annual report to reflect the change 
during the ten years ending in december  we incurred minimal exploration and acquisition costs  liquidated substantially all our properties and completed out of court debt restructurings 
the out of court debt restructurings were completed during and during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a change in ownership control and we appointed new management 
our management views us as a new company and believes our past operations are insignificant and not relevant to our future plans 
our new management changed the accounting method for oil and natural gas properties because management believes the full cost method more appropriately reflects our change in focus for future operations 
further  our new management does not believe that using the successful efforts method of accounting is appropriate for a small to medium size acquisition  development and exploitation company 
our liquidity and capital resources general on december  we had working capital of million compared to million on december  our working capital at december  includes a receivable of approximately million due from an escrow agent as a result of the sale by us of certain oil and natural gas properties located in jackson parish  louisiana 
this receivable was subsequently paid on january  the payment consisted of approximately million cash 
our working capital on december  was million compared to  on december  the sale of common stock through a rights offering in august for net proceeds of million contributed to this million increase in our working capital 
our budget for capital expenditures is approximately million 
deferred income taxes under applicable federal and state tax laws  we are able to carry forward  subject to limitations  net operating losses nols incurred by exco and rio grande  inc in prior years 
we are able to apply a portion of these nols to reduce the amount of income taxes accrued by us in subsequent years 
we account for these nols by establishing an off balance sheet deferred tax asset 
we believe that some of our nols may expire unused and  accordingly  we must reduce the value of the deferred tax asset 
we have established a valuation allowance of million to reflect this reduction 
additional discussion can be found in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note income taxes 
long term debt on december   we had no long term debt 
sale of equity on july   we commenced a rights offering to our existing shareholders 
each shareholder received ten rights for each share of our common stock held 
each right entitled the shareholder to purchase one share of our common stock for per share 
the rights offering expired on august  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
the exercise of the rights by some existing shareholders or their assignees has resulted in the dilution of the shares of common stock held by those shareholders who did not exercise their rights 
to date  we have used million to repay our indebtedness  million for the acquisition of rio grande  inc   for our share of capital contributions to exco energy investors  llc  million for our share of capital contributions to exus energy  llc  a loan of million to venus exploration  inc to fund their capital contribution to exus energy  llc  and  for general corporate purposes 
we intend to use the remaining proceeds of the rights offering for acquisitions  development drilling and recompletions  the repayment of bank indebtedness  working capital and general corporate purposes 
credit facility on february   we entered into a credit facility with nationsbank of texas  na the credit facility provided for borrowings up to million  subject to borrowing base limitations 
on september   we entered into the first amendment to the credit facility with nationsbank  na successor by merger to nationsbank of texas  na the first amendment provides for borrowings up to million  subject to borrowing base limitations  as determined by the lenders from time to time 
on february   we entered into the second amendment to the credit facility with bank of america  na successor by merger to nationsbank  na the second amendment provides for a new termination date  an increase in our borrowing base  subject to certain conditions  and an increase in certain thresholds customary for a growing company 
the bank has sole discretion to determine our borrowing base based on its valuation of our reserves valued semi annually 
the credit facility consists of a regular revolver which on december   had a borrowing base of approximately million 
on february  our borrowing base was increased to million 
on february   our borrowing base was increased to million  of which million has been drawn and million was available for borrowing 
the additional million of borrowing will become available upon resolving outstanding title description issues 
a portion of the borrowing base is available for the issuance of letters of credit 
all borrowings under the credit facility are secured by tangible and intangible assets representing at least of the assessed present value of our oil and natural gas properties 
the credit facility provides that if our aggregate outstanding indebtedness is less than million  advances will bear interest at over the appropriate libor rate 
if our aggregate outstanding indebtedness is greater than million  then our advances will bear interest at over libor if the borrowing base usage is less than  over libor if the borrowing base usage is between  over libor if the borrowing base usage is between  and over libor if the borrowing base usage exceeds 
at march   the month libor rate was  resulting in an interest rate of approximately on our outstanding indebtedness 
the credit facility also permits us to repay and reborrow amounts under the credit facility without any penalty  thereby allowing us the flexibility to utilize any available cash to reduce our outstanding indebtedness and thus  our costs of borrowed funds 
under the terms of the credit facility  we must not permit our current ratio of consolidated current assets to our consolidated current liabilities to be less than to at any time 
in addition  we must maintain a tangible net worth of at least  plus i subsequent to december   of our consolidated cumulative net income and ii an amount equal to of the net proceeds we receive from the issuance of any equity securities after december  at december  we were required to maintain a tangible net worth of at least million 
on december   and february   we were in compliance with both the consolidated tangible net worth covenant and the current ratio covenant 
no principal amortization will be required during the term of the credit facility as long as the aggregate principal balance does not exceed the borrowing base then in effect 
however  if a borrowing base deficiency were to exist after giving effect to a redetermination  then we would have to do one of the following o eliminate the borrowing base deficiency by making a single mandatory prepayment of principal on the revolving loan in an amount equal to the entire amount of the borrowing base deficiency on the first monthly date following the date on which the borrowing base deficiency is determined to exist  o eliminate the deficiency by making six consecutive mandatory prepayments of principal on the revolving loan each of which shall be in the amount of one sixth th of the amount of the borrowing base deficiency commencing on the first monthly date following the date on which the borrowing base deficiency is determined to exist and continuing on each monthly date thereafter  or o eliminate the borrowing base deficiency by submitting additional mineral interests to the banks on the first monthly date following the date on which the borrowing base deficiency is determined to exist for evaluation as borrowing base properties which the banks  in their sole discretion  determine have a value sufficient to increase the borrowing base by at least the amount of the borrowing base deficiency 
the credit facility matures on february  our next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for no later than april   and semi annually thereafter 
we may seek additional borrowing capacity at that time for our development drilling program 
however  we cannot assure you that our current development program will result in increased collateral values or that these values will enable us to borrow the funds we need to continue the program 
the credit facility contains a number of covenants affecting our liquidity and capital resources  including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness at any time in an amount exceeding  or to pledge assets outside of the credit facility 
need to raise additional capital the growth of our business will require substantial capital on a continuing basis 
we cannot assure you that additional funds we may require will be available on satisfactory terms and conditions  if at all 
we may pursue  from time to time  opportunities to acquire oil and natural gas properties and businesses that may utilize the capital we currently expect to be available for our present operations 
the amount and timing of our future capital requirements  if any  will depend upon a number of factors  including drilling costs  transportation costs  equipment costs  marketing expenses  staffing levels  competitive conditions  and any purchases or dispositions of assets 
we do not control many of these factors 
if we fail to obtain any required additional financing  then our growth  cash flow and earnings may be adversely affected 
in addition  we may incur additional debt or engage in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities in our pursuit of additional capital 
effect of inflation and changing prices on our business it is difficult for us to assess the impact of inflation on our business 
in and through the first quarter of  we experienced a weakness in the prices we received for our oil and natural gas production 
in the latter half of we experienced increases in the prices we received for our oil and natural gas 
we cannot anticipate whether inflation will remain at its present level 
however  a sudden increase in inflation and or an increase in our operating costs or drilling costs coupled with a reduction in oil or natural gas prices could have an adverse effect on our operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement 
companies must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   however  beginning june   companies may implement the statement as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter 
sfas cannot be applied retroactively and must be applied to a derivative instruments and b certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued  acquired  or substantively modified after december  and  at our election  before january  we have not yet quantified the impact of adopting sfas on the financial statements and have not determined the timing of or method of adoption of sfas our year compliance as of the date of this report  we have not experienced any significant disruptions to financial or operating activities as a result of the year issues 
we experienced no internal system disruptions and we are not aware of any failures affecting third parties that conduct operations affecting our business 
we will continue to monitor the situation for any internal or third party disruptions  but we do not expect any disruptions 
as of february   we have incurred approximately  in consulting costs for year project planning 
all software packages requiring an upgrade which had been identified were upgraded 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk some of the information below contains forward looking statements 
see item investment considerations and risk factors forward looking statements for additional factors relating to these statements 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices 
the disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides an indicator of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
our market risk sensitive instrument was entered into for hedging purposes  not for trading purposes 
commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices for natural gas 
pricing for oil and natural gas production is volatile 
in an effort to reduce the effects of the volatility of the price of oil and natural gas on our operations  management has adopted a policy of hedging oil and natural gas prices whenever such prices are in excess of the prices anticipated in our operating budget and profit plan through the use of commodity futures  options  and swap agreements 
hedging transactions require the approval of the board of directors 
we had no outstanding hedging agreements at december  and on september   we entered into an oil commodity swap  accounted for as a derivative commodity instrument  with a counterparty to sell notional volumes of  bbls per month at a fixed price of per bbl based on nymex pricing 
the transaction was effective october   and terminates september  realized gains or losses from the settlement of the swap are recorded separately in the financial statements as an increase or decrease in total revenues 
for a given month when the settlement price exceeds  then a reduction in total revenues is recorded for the difference between the settlement price and multiplied times the notional volume of  bbls 
conversely  if the settlement price is less than  then an increase in total revenues is recorded for the difference between the settlement price and multiplied times the notional volume of  bbls 
for example  for a given month  if the settlement price is  then total revenues will decrease by  conversely  if the settlement price for a given month is  total revenues will increase by  the fair value at december  of the commodity swap was a liability of approximately  and has been estimated from a quote provided by the counterparty 
this liability represents the estimated amount that we would expect to pay to terminate the agreement on december  we report average oil prices per bbl including the effects of oil quality  gathering and transportation costs but excluding the net effect of the oil hedge 
the following table sets forth our oil prices  both realized before hedge results and realized including hedge results  and the net effects of settlements of oil price hedges to revenue year ended december  average price per bbl realized before hedge results average price per bbl realized including hedge results reduction to revenue
