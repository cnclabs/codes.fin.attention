fiscal results include inventory impairment charges of  in the aerospace distribution segment  costs relating to acquisitions of  and restructuring charges of  in the aerospace fasteners segment  in the aerospace distribution segment  and at corporate 
the following unaudited pro forma table illustrates sales and operating income of our operations by segment  on a pro forma basis  as if we had operated in a consistent manner for the past three years 
the pro forma results represent the impact of our acquisition of kaynar technologies completed in april  our merger with banner aerospace completed in april  our acquisition of special t effective january  and our dispositions of dallas aerospace december  solair december  the hardware group of banner aerospace completed january  and the investment in nacanco paketleme july and shared technologies fairchild completed in march  as if these transactions had occurred at the beginning of each period presented 
the pro forma information is based on the historical financial statements of these companies  giving effect to the aforementioned transactions 
the pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would actually have occurred if the transactions had been in effect since the beginning of each period  nor are they necessarily indicative of our future results

fiscal results include costs relating to acquisitions of  and restructuring charges of  in the aerospace fasteners segment  in the aerospace distribution segment  and at corporate 
net sales of million in increased by million  or  compared to sales of million in the improvement is attributable primarily to the additional revenues provided by the acquisition of kaynar technologies  offset partially by the dispositions of solair and dallas aerospace 
net sales of million in decreased by million  or  compared to sales of million in the decrease is attributable primarily to the loss of revenues resulting from the disposition of our aerospace distribution segment s hardware group and solair 
on a pro forma basis  net sales decreased and in and  respectively  as compared to the previous fiscal periods 
gross margin as a percentage of sales was   and in   and  respectively 
included in cost of goods sold for was a charge of million recognized in our aerospace distribution segment from the dispositions of solair and dallas aerospace 
of this charge  million was attributable to solair s bulk sale of inventory at prices below the carrying amount 
excluding these charges  gross margin as a percentage of sales was in fiscal the change in margins in and periods are attributable to a change in product mix as a result of the acquisitions and dispositions 
partially offsetting the overall lower margins in was an improvement in margins within our aerospace fasteners segment  resulting from acquisitions  efficiencies associated with production being integrated  and improved skills of the work force 
selling  general administrative expense as a percentage of sales was   and  in   and  respectively 
included in selling  general administrative expense in fiscal were million of one time costs associated primarily with the acquisition of kaynar technologies 
excluding these costs  selling  general administrative expense as a percentage of sales would have been in other income increased million in as compared to  due primarily to million of gains recognized on the disposition of real estate and million in increased rental income received from new tenants occupying a shopping center we own and are developing in farmingdale  new york 
other income decreased million in as compared to  due primarily to the fiscal condemnation of air rights over a portion of the property we own in farmingdale  new york 
in fiscal  we recorded million of restructuring charges 
of this amount  million was recorded at our corporate office for severance benefits and million was recorded at our aerospace distribution segment for the write off of building improvements from premises vacated 
the remainder  million was recorded as a result of the costs incurred from the initial integration of kaynar technologies into our aerospace fasteners segment  ie for severance benefits million  for product integration costs incurred as of june  million  and for the write down of fixed assets million 
in fiscal  we recorded million of restructuring charges as a result of the continued integration of kaynar technologies into our aerospace fasteners segment 
all of the charges recorded were a direct result of product and plant integration costs incurred as of june  these costs were classified as restructuring and were the direct result of formal plans to move equipment  close plants and to terminate employees 
such costs are nonrecurring in nature 
other than a reduction in our existing cost structure  none of the restructuring charges resulted in future increases in earnings or represented an accrual of future costs 
as of june   significantly all of our integration plans have been executed and our integration process is substantially complete 
operating income of million in fiscal increased million  or  compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal we reported an operating loss of million in fiscal  which was a decrease from operating income of million reported in fiscal fiscal was affected by million of expenses recognized for inventory impairment  restructuring costs and other costs related to acquisitions 
fiscal results also improved because of million of gains recognized on the sale of real estate  and million in increased rental income received from new tenants occupying a shopping center we own and are developing in farmingdale  new york 
net interest expense increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal  as a result of the additional debt we incurred to finance the acquisition of kaynar technologies 
net interest expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the improvement in fiscal was due to a series of transactions occurring in fiscal that significantly reduced our total debt 
investment income loss  net  was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
investment income in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  was due primarily to recognizing realized gains on investments liquidated 
we recognized a large gain in from the liquidation of our position in alliedsignal to raise funds to acquire kaynar technologies 
nonrecurring income of million in fiscal resulted from a million  million  and million gains recognized on the disposition of our equity investment in nacanco paketleme  our camloc gas springs division and a smaller equity investment  respectively 
nonrecurring income of million in resulted from the disposition of banner aerospace s hardware group 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal on earnings from continuing operations of million 
a tax benefit was recorded due primarily to a change in the estimate of required tax accruals 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal representing a effective tax rate on pre tax losses from continuing operations 
the tax benefit approximates the statutory rate 
the income tax provision of million reported in fiscal represents a effective tax rate on pre tax earnings from continuing operations of million 
the tax provision was slightly higher than the statutory rate because of goodwill associated with the disposition of banner aerospace s hardware group  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
equity in earnings of affiliates decreased million in  compared to  and million in  compared to in july  we divested our interest in nacanco and this reduced our equity earnings in fiscal the decrease in was attributable primarily to losses recorded by small start up ventures 
included in earnings loss from discontinued operations are the results of fairchild technologies through january  and our equity in earnings of shared technologies fairchild prior to the merger of shared technologies fairchild 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in  we recorded a million gain  net of tax  on disposal of discontinued operations  from the proceeds received from the merger of shared technologies fairchild 
this gain was partially offset in connection with the adoption of a formal plan to enhance the opportunities for disposition of fairchild technologies 
in connection with the adoption of such plan  we recorded an after tax charge of million  million and million in discontinued operations in fiscal  and  respectively 
included in the fiscal charge  was million  net of an income tax benefit of million  for the net losses of fairchild technologies through june   and million  net of an income tax benefit of million  for the estimated remaining operating losses of fairchild technologies 
the fiscal after tax operating loss from fairchild technologies exceeded the june estimate recorded for expected losses by million  net of an income tax benefit of million  through june an additional after tax charge of million  net of an income tax benefit of million  was recorded in fiscal  for estimated remaining losses in connection with the disposition of fairchild technologies 
the fiscal after tax loss in connection with the disposition of the remaining operations of fairchild technologies exceeded anticipated losses by million  net of an income tax benefit of million 
in fiscal  we recognized an extraordinary loss of million  net of tax  to write off the remaining deferred loan fees associated with the early extinguishment of our indebtedness pursuant to our acquisition of kaynar technologies see note 
in fiscal  we recognized an extraordinary loss of million  net of tax  to write off the remaining deferred loan fees and original issue discounts associated with early extinguishment of our indebtedness pursuant the repayment of all our public debt and refinancing of credit facilities 
comprehensive income loss includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized holding changes in the fair market value of available for sale investment securities 
the fair market value of unrealized holding securities declined by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the changes reflect primarily gains realized from the liquidation of investments  including alliedsignal common stock divested in fiscal foreign currency translation adjustments decreased by million and million in fiscal and  respectively  due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the french franc and german mark 
segment results aerospace fasteners segment sales by our aerospace fasteners segment increased by million to million  up in fiscal  compared to fiscal these improvements reflected growth from acquisitions  offset partially by weakened demand for our products in the commercial aerospace industry 
on june   our backlog was million compared to million at june  on a pro forma basis  sales decreased by in fiscal  as compared to fiscal our operations in the united states were negatively impacted by reduced bookings caused by inventory reduction efforts at boeing and its ripple effect on prices 
sales in the aerospace fasteners segment increased by million to million  up in fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflecting growth due primarily to the acquisition of kaynar technologies 
backlog increased by million in fiscal to million at june   reflecting the acquisition of kaynar technologies 
excluding million of backlog contributed by kaynar technologies  our backlog decreased million in fiscal on a pro forma basis reflecting acquisitions in comparable periods  sales decreased in fiscal  compared to fiscal operating income in our aerospace fasteners segment decreased by million in fiscal  compared to fiscal included in our fiscal and results are restructuring charges incurred of million and million  respectively  due to the integration of kaynar technologies into our aerospace fasteners business 
excluding restructuring charges  operating income decreased by million in fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflecting reduced margins due to pricing pressures offset partially by cost improvement initiatives and acquisitions made during fiscal operating expenses at all operations are being strictly controlled as management attempts to reduce operating costs to improve operating results in the short term  without adversely affecting our future performance 
operating income increased by million  or  in fiscal  compared to fiscal included in our results are restructuring charges of million for integration costs and severance from the integration of our business with the kaynar technologies business 
excluding restructuring charges  operating income increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal on a pro forma basis and excluding restructuring charges  operating income decreased by million in fiscal  compared to fiscal  and million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to lower sales levels associated with a weakened commercial aerospace industry and its negative effects on operating effectiveness 
we believe the overall demand for aerospace fasteners in fiscal will improve as the results of boeing s inventory reduction program diminishes and the announced increase in aircraft build rates favorably affect demand 
we believe that the integration savings from the kaynar merger and production efficiency improvements will partially offset the weakened demand for our products 
aerospace distribution segment sales in our aerospace distribution segment decreased by million  or  in fiscal  compared to the fiscal period 
the decrease was due to the loss of revenues as a result of the disposition of solair and dallas aerospace 
sales decreased by million  or  in fiscal  compared to the fiscal period  due primarily to the loss of revenues as a result of the disposition of the hardware group and solair 
on a pro forma basis  sales increased million  or  in compared to  and million  or  in compared to operating income in our aerospace distribution segment increased by million in fiscal  compared to fiscal included in the fiscal period  was a charge of million due to the sale of solair and a million charge relating to the potential sale of dallas aerospace 
operating income decreased by million  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal a charge of million is included in the results  in connection with the disposition of solair and the potential disposition of dallas aerospace 
excluding these charges  operating income would have decreased million in fiscal  compared to fiscal  due primarily to the disposition of solair and the hardware group 
on a pro forma basis  operating income increased by million in fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflecting increases in margins and a reduction in corporate overhead 
corporate and other the corporate and other segment includes the gas springs division prior to its disposition and corporate activities 
the group reported an improvement of million  or  reducing operating losses from million in fiscal to million in fiscal an operating loss of million in fiscal was million higher than the operating loss of million reported in fiscal results from fiscal included million of gains recognized on the disposition of real estate and million in increased rental income received from new tenants occupying a shopping center we own and are developing in farmingdale  new york 
results from fiscal included million of one time costs associated primarily with the acquisition of kaynar technologies  restructuring charges  and increased environmental  legal and travel expenses 
results from fiscal included other income of million  including million realized as a result of the condemnation of air rights over a portion of the property we own and are developing in farmingdale  new york 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources total capitalization as of june  and amounted to million and million  respectively 
the changes in capitalization included a decrease of million in debt and a decrease of million in equity 
the decrease in debt reflected a million decrease in term loan borrowing with our primary lenders  as a result of the proceeds received from the divestiture of assets  offset partially by million of cash borrowed from a new term loan facility used to support our operations and finance construction costs to complete a shopping center being developed in farmingdale  new york 
the decrease in equity was due primarily to a million decrease in cumulative other comprehensive income  offset partially by reported net income of million 
we maintain a portfolio of investments classified primarily as available for sale securities  which had a fair market value of million at june  the market value of the investment portfolio decreased by million in as a result of realized gains from the divestiture of securities 
while there is risk associated with market fluctuations inherent in stock investments  and because our portfolio is not diversified  large swings in its value should be expected 
we have an acre site in farmingdale  new york  which we are developing and operating as a shopping center 
we have invested cash and capitalized interest approximately million  million  and million into this project in  and  respectively 
we estimate additional funding of approximately million is needed to complete the current phases of this project

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and supersedes and amends a number of existing accounting standards 
it requires that all derivatives be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value 
the corresponding derivative gains or losses are reported based on the hedge relationship that exists  if any 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges or that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria in sfas  are required to be reported in earnings 
most of the general qualifying criteria for hedge accounting under sfas were derived from  and are similar to  the existing qualifying criteria in sfas accounting for futures contracts 
sfas describes three primary types of hedge relationships fair value hedge  cash flow hedge  and foreign currency hedge 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
to defer the required effective date of implementing sfas from fiscal years beginning after june  to fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted sfas on july  and recognize a cumulative pre tax loss of approximately million
