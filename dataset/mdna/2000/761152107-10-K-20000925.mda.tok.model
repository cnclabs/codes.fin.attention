new accounting pronouncements sfas no  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  and sfas no  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no an amendment of fasb statement no were issued by the financial accounting standards board in june and june  respectively and are effective for the company s quarter ending september  sfas standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under the standard  entities are required to carry all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
if certain conditions are met  entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values  cash flows  or foreign currencies 
if the hedged exposure is a fair value exposure  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
accounting for foreign currency hedges is similar to the accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges 
if the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change 
the company believes that  due to the restrictive definition of hedge effectiveness contained in statement  the company s hedging contracts will not have hedge effectiveness and will therefore be marked to market with resulting gains or losses being recognized in earnings in the period of change 
this is consistent with the company s current accounting policy and therefore the company does not expect adoption of statement will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operation 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company will be required to adopt sab in the first quarter of fiscal sab requires  among other things  that license and other up front fees be recognized over the term of the agreement  unless the fees are in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
the company does not expect this to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operation

the risks and uncertainties that may affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations include the following the market for products designed to treat sleep disordered breathing related respiratory conditions is characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology 
the development of new or innovative products by others or the discovery of alternative treatments for such conditions could result in the company s products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market for the company s products is also highly competitive 
the failure of the company to meet the prices offered by its competitors  or offer products which either contain features similar to or more desirable than those products offered by its competitors or which are perceived as unreliable by consumers could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
most of the company s competitors have greater financial  research  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  some of the company s competitors sell additional lines of products  and therefore can bundle products to offer higher discounts  or offer rebates or other incentive programs to gain a competitive advantage 
the company s competitors may also employ litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
the company s inability to compete effectively against existing or future competitors would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s operating results have  from time to time  fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations may result from the absence of a backlog of orders for the company s products  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  the geographic mix of product sales  the success of the company s marketing efforts in new regions  changes in third party reimbursement  timing of regulatory action  timing of orders by distributors  expenditures incurred for research and development  competitive pricing in different regions  seasonality  the cost and effect of promotional and marketing programs and the effect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses  among other factors  in addition  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws in the various countries in which the company conducts its operations 
the company s success is dependent upon the ability of the company s customers to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors for purchasing the company s products 
third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the prescribed device has not received appropriate united states food and drug administration fda or other governmental regulatory clearances  is not used in accordance with cost effective treatment methods as determined by the payor  or is experimental  unnecessary or inappropriate 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
the cost containment measures that health care providers are instituting could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to sell its products and may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in some markets  such as spain  france and germany  government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of the company s products  subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations 
in australia and some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleep disordered breathing related respiratory conditions 
a substantial portion of the company s net revenue is generated from sales outside north america 
the company expects that such sales will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s net revenues in the future 
the company s sales outside of north america are subject to certain inherent risks of global operations  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs  import licenses  trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies and foreign medical device manufacturing regulations 
the company has had foreign currency transaction gains and losses in recent periods 
a significant fall in the value of the united states dollar against certain international currencies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
other factors which could potentially have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial conditions include the costs and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings  settlements and investigations  claims and changes in those items  and developments or assertions by or against the company relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses
