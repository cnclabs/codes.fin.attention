operating pattern the company experiences an irregular pattern of quarterly operating results  caused primarily by fluctuations in both the number and size of software license contracts received and delivered from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operating activities provided cash of approximately million in the year ended april   compared to approximately million in the same period of the prior year

cash used in investing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended april  and  respectively 
the majority of the cash was used for computer software development costs  purchases of held to maturities investments  purchases of property and equipment  purchase of common stock by subsidiary  purchase of majority investment in subsidiaries and minority investment and additional funding in business

in fiscal year  cash was used for the purchase of common stock of the company in the amount of million and for the payment of capital lease obligations in the amount of million 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were days as of april  and april  the company s current ratio was to and cash and investments totaled of total assets at april  compared to a current ratio of to and cash and investments totaling of total assets at april  the company expects existing cash and investments  combined with cash generated from operations  to be sufficient to meet its operational needs in fiscal the company may seek additional sources of capital to meet its growth objectives in the future 
to the extent that such amounts are insufficient to finance the company s capital requirements  the company will be required to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing 
the company does not currently have a bank line of credit 
no assurance can be given that bank lines of credit or other financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
if available  such financing may result in further dilution to the company s shareholders and higher interest expense 
on december   the company s board of directors approved a resolution authorizing the company to repurchase up to million shares of the company s class a common stock 
on march   the company s board of directors approved a resolution authorizing the company to repurchase an additional  shares for a total of up to million shares of the company s class a common stock 
this repurchase will be through open market purchases at prevailing market prices 
the timing of any repurchases will depend on market conditions  the market price of the company s common stock and management s assessment of the company s liquidity and cash flow needs 
since the adoption of these resolutions  the company has repurchased approximately million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately million as of april  year readiness disclosure products the company believes that its compliance and remediation efforts leading up to the year were effective in preventing any material year related problems 
this belief is based on the fact that the company has not received to date any report of year related erroneous results or system failures in the software products it markets or in the software and hardware it utilizes internally 
there may however  be residual problems related to the year issue that could result in a decrease in the sales of software and services the company provides  or an increase in litigation costs relating to losses suffered by the company or its clients due to such problems 
in the future  the company may be subject to claims based on year problems in its own products  as well as in others products  and issues arising from the integration of multiple products within an overall system 
although the company has not been a party to any litigation involving its products or services related to year compliance issues  there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future be required to defend its products or services in such proceedings  or otherwise address claims based on year issues 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  and any liability of the company for year related damages  including consequential damages  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company believes that year issues have affected and may continue to affect the purchasing decisions of customers and potential customers of the company s products 
many businesses expended significant resources on projects to make their current hardware and software systems year ready 
such expenditures may result in reduced funding for projects to purchase software products such as those offered by the company 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
internal systems the company has completed of its system evaluation and of its remediation 
while it appears that all internal systems are year compliant  there is still a possibility of residual internal system problems related to the year issue 
the cost of correcting any residual problems on internal systems would probably not be material because we could use internal resources to correct potential problems 
the company utilizes third party vendor equipment  telecommunication products and software products  all of which appear to be year compliant 
there may be residual problems related to the year issue 
the failure of any third party products may have a material adverse effect on business operations and could possibly cause the company to expend resources to correct any problems 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
foreign currency 
in the fiscal year ended april   the company generated of its revenues outside the united states 
international sales usually are made by the company s foreign subsidiaries and are denominated typically in us dollars or british pounds sterling 
however  the expense incurred by foreign subsidiaries is denominated in the local currencies 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company in fiscal was not material 
interest rates and other market risks 
the company manages its interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio of available for sale instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
these instruments include  but are not limited to  money market instruments  bank time deposits  and taxable and tax advantaged variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities  and national  state  and local government agencies  in accordance with an investment policy approved by the company s board of directors 
these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
the fair value of securities at april  was approximately million 
interest income on the company s investments is carried in other income expense 
the company also holds cash balances in accounts with commercial banks in the united states and foreign countries 
these cash balances represent operating balances only and are invested in short term time deposits of the local bank 
such operating cash balances held at banks outside the united states are denominated in the local currency 
many of the company s investments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
when interest rates fall  the company s income from investments in variable rate securities declines 
when interest rates rise  the fair market value of the company s investments in fixed rate securities decreases 
in addition  the company s equity investments are subject to stock market volatility 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to mitigate risk by holding fixed rate securities to maturity  but should its liquidity needs force it to sell fixed rate securities prior to maturity  the company may experience a loss of principal 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement was amended in june by statement no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
statement no 
will be effective for the company beginning may  the new statement requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes accounting treatment for three types of hedges hedges of changes in the fair value of assets  liabilities  or firm commitments  hedges of the variable cash flows of forecasted transactions  and hedges of foreign currency exposures of net investments in foreign operations 
the company has not invested in derivative instruments nor participated in hedging activities and  therefore  does not anticipate there will be a material impact on the results of operations or financial position from statement no 
or no 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab and amended it in march and june we are required to adopt the provisions of sab in our fourth quarter of fiscal we are currently reviewing the provisions of sab and have not fully assessed the impact of its adoption 
while sab does not supercede the software industry specific revenue recognition guidance  which we believe we comply with  the sec staff has recently informally indicated its views related to sab that may change current interpretations of software revenue recognition requirements 
such sec interpretations could result in many software companies  including us  recording a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles retroactive to may  forward looking statements the foregoing discussion contains forward looking statements  which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
there are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by statements made herein 
the timing of releases of the company s software products can be affected by client needs  marketplace demands and technological advances 
development plans frequently change  and it is difficult to predict with accuracy the release dates for products in development 
in addition  other factors  including changes in general economic conditions  the growth rate of the market for the company s products and services  the timely availability and market acceptance of these products and services  the effect of competitive products and pricing  and the irregular pattern of revenues  as well as a number of other risk factors  could affect the future performance of the company
