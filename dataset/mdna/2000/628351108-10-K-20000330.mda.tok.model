item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and consolidated net income decreased by to million in from million in which was in turn a increase over the million earned in the decline in earnings in is due to slower growth in the program business segment and a decline in corporate risk management offset  in part  by growth in specialty brokerage and financial services 
earnings were also adversely affected by the third quarter provisions related to net losses incurred on terminated programs of million  net of tax 
the increase in earnings was primarily attributable to the growth experienced in the program business and financial services segments 
all prior period results have been restated to reflect a pooling of interests following the acquisition of captive resources  inc set forth in table i is an analysis of the components of the company s revenues for each of the last three years 
table i revenues in thousands year ended december  growth growth fee income    premiums earned    net investment income    realized capital losses    other income total    the growth of fee income and premiums earned over the past three years has been primarily due to the strong growth in program business  which has compensated for the decline in corporate risk management business 
overall  pre tax profit margins on fee income fell in to compared to in and in segment analysis the components of fee income by business segment are illustrated in table ii 
table ii fee income by business segment in thousands year ended december  growth growth program business fees    corporate risk management fees    specialty brokerage fees    financial services fees    total    program business program business involves replacing traditional insurers and acting as the conduit between producers of specialty books of business and reinsurers wishing to write that business 
program business accounted for of total fees for compared to in and in this growth has resulted from the continued expansion of this business as a result of reinsurers increased appetite for premium volume in the current soft market 
fees earned on individual program accounts are more likely to grow compared to corporate accounts because new policy holders are constantly being added in each program 
program business also has historically had a higher retention rate than corporate risk management 
pre tax margins in this segment were for compared to in and in the second half of saw a decline in the growth rate and margins in this segment as a result of a decline in premium rates  especially at the company s underwriting management subsidiary  small business underwriters 
corporate risk management corporate risk management  the company s original business segment  involves providing services to businesses and associations seeking to insure a portion of their risk in a loss sensitive alternative market structure 
this segment  which accounted for of total fee income for compared to in and in  has been the most affected by the extremely soft insurance market cycle for commercial risks 
corporate risk management fees decreased in both and due to these soft market conditions 
the number of corporate risk management accounts decreased in to from in which was in turn down from in profit margins fell in to compared to in and in the profit margin was negatively impacted by the decrease in fees on program business because certain operating expenses are not separately identified by segment  but rather are apportioned by fee income 
historically  workers compensation has been the major line of business written by the company in both its corporate risk and program business segments 
generally  competition for workers compensation business has increased in recent years and the resulting under pricing of workers compensation risks by traditional insurers has reduced the incentive for insureds to enter alternative market vehicles such as those offered by the company in its corporate risk management segment 
however  the company is beginning to see price increases in a number of lines  particularly in california workers compensation and in accident and health across the us  resulting in increased submission activity 
despite these competitive forces  the company was successful in increasing its business as a result of the attractiveness of program business in this soft reinsurance market 
the company continued to diversify its business to reduce its reliance on the workers compensation market and was successful in doing so 
as a percentage of total fee income  workers compensation accounts decreased from over at december  to at december  as a result of the company writing accounts comprising other lines of coverage such as accident and health  commercial  auto liability  auto physical damage and other liability coverages as well as the expansion of the company s financial services segment 
specialty brokerage the company s specialty brokerage business segment provides access to alternative risk transfer insurers and reinsurers in bermuda and europe 
fees in this segment grew by in the year as a result of increased business placed in bermuda and london 
profit margins improved to from in and in primarily as a result of the increased revenues 
financial services financial services  the company s newest business segment  provides administrative services to offshore mutual funds and other companies 
this segment also includes the company s family of proprietary mutual funds as well as asset accumulation life insurance products for the high net worth market 
financial services accounted for of total fee income for  up from for and in fees from financial services increased primarily as a result of an increase in the number of mutual funds under management from in and in  to in profit margins decreased from in to in  and improved to in margins in the financial services segment were adversely affected in both and by the previously announced revised executive incentive plan implemented in the effect of this revised executive incentive plan will continue through excluding the effect of the revised executive incentive plan  the profit margins in this segment would have been and for the years ended december  and respectively 
underwriting the company generally requires each corporate risk management client to indemnify it against an underwriting loss and the client normally provides collateral for at least the difference between the funds available in that client s account and the level of expected losses as actuarially determined by the company  although in certain circumstances the collateral level is below the level of expected losses 
this is also the case for program business clients who participate in the ipc programs 
for program business clients that do not participate in the ipc programs  reinsurance protection is purchased by the company to minimize its underwriting risk 
the company faces a credit exposure in the event that losses exceed their expected level and the client is unable or unwilling to honor its indemnity to the company 
the company also faces credit exposure on both program and corporate risk business if its clients or brokers fail to pay the premium due  through failure of the program manager or broker to properly administer the program and through failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations 
lastly  the company is exposed to underwriting risk if losses incurred under programs exceed their reinsurance limits or where there is a gap in purchased reinsurance cover 
the company has established provisions for losses as a result of these exposures for certain clients 
these provisions  which totaled million at december   million in and million in  reduced the level of fee income in each year by million  
million and million respectively 
these provisions also adversely impacted the underwriting results in each year by million  
million and in   and due to programs where losses exceeded reinsurance limits and uncollected premiums 
the increase in provisions from to relates primarily to provisions established in the third quarter on a number of terminated programs 
the provisions are net of a reinsurance recovery of million under a contingency excess of loss policy 
the increase in the number of accounts and their inherent growth in premium volume  the increase in the clients aggregate retentions since  the amounts recoverable from reinsurers  which amounted to billion at december  and billion at december   in addition to competitive factors which have limited the amount of collateral that clients are willing to provide  have significantly increased the company s exposure to such losses 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its clients  brokers and reinsurers to minimize its exposure to losses from insolvencies 
during  the company initiated binding arbitration proceedings for the payment of reinsurance recoverables from a number of reinsurers who have withheld payment due to the company 
the amounts due to the company relate primarily to reinsurance on workers compensation coverage 
the company believes it will ultimately prevail in such arbitrations and any related actions that may arise 
premiums earned increased by in  in and in these increases are attributable to the shift in business from the corporate risk management segment to the program business segment and the strong growth within this segment 
program business usually involves higher premiums than business derived from the corporate risk management segment due to new policies constantly being added by agents 
premiums earned represent the net premiums retained by the company on which it bears underwriting risk 
the company believes that both the volatility of underwriting profit or loss and the probability of experiencing a severe underwriting loss are less than would ordinarily be expected for a traditional property casualty insurer  due to the nature of the business written by the company and the structure of its reinsurance 
in the past  the level of premiums earned has been closely matched by the level of total insurance costs  resulting in small amounts of underwriting loss as a percentage of premiums earned 
however  in  losses incurred under certain programs exceeded their reinsurance limits and caused underwriting losses to be higher than historical levels 
the fact that premiums earned have historically matched total insurance costs means that even a significant fluctuation in premiums earned should have a relatively insignificant impact on the company s net income 
included in premiums earned are assigned risk premiums of million in as compared to million in and million in the underwriting losses associated with these assigned risk premiums  together with other charges imposed by certain states on voluntary insurers such as legion to support involuntary market losses residual market loads  are passed on by legion to clients accounts 
other than the risks described above  the company s principal exposure to underwriting loss exists in relation to the premium associated with the company s retention of a portion of the specific and aggregate excess risk on each client s account 
on this retained excess risk the company may experience volatility in underwriting results 
the portion of the company s premiums earned which relate to this risk was million in as compared to million in and million in  representing   and of premiums earned in  and respectively 
the company incurred an underwriting loss of million in  million in and million in the large loss in was principally due to the provisions on terminated programs described above 
these underwriting losses were also a result of retained risk on the company s treaties and underwriting expenses 
the company takes of the risk within the first million layer of the aggregate excess exposure on its main treaty up to a deductible amount equal to of the company s gross premiums as defined and of the risk over a loss ratio of  in the event that the loss ratio for the first layer exceeds 
the company takes no share of the risk in the layer million excess of million per account 
the maximum retention for specific excess losses is of 
million excess of 
million per occurrence 
investment income gross investment income increased by 
million in to from million in and million in as a result of increases in gross invested assets 
net investment income  after adjusting for investment income which is payable to others  increased by to million in from million in and million in the increase in net investment income for is due  in part  to the inclusion of investment income from one of the company s programs  accounted for as claims deposit liabilities  which added million for the year 
net invested assets increased million or to million in from million in and million in the yield on these assets remained steady at in and  which was up slightly from in the company s investment income is produced through the investment of its capital funds  long term debt  other funds held representing amounts due others and reserves held by the company for unearned premiums and unpaid losses 
the breakdown of expenses for each of  and is set forth in table iii 
table iii expenses in thousands year ended december  growth growth losses incurred    acquisition costs    total insurance costs    operating expenses    interest expense    other expenses    total    the increases in total insurance costs are typically the direct result of the increases in premiums earned during the relevant period 
however  total insurance costs during exceeded the increase in premiums earned 
during the year  the company established a provision related to net losses incurred on a number of terminated programs of million net of tax 
this resulted in a million increase in losses and loss expenses incurred offset by a million reduction in income taxes 
losses incurred also increased as a direct result of the decreased use of large deductible policies and the increase in program business 
the decrease in acquisition costs from to is due to the reduction in the number of deductible programs  which have high expense levels  the loss of one large account that was fully retained  and reduction in expenses charged by the assigned risk pools 
the primary factors responsible for the increases in operating expenses were a the increased cost of administering the company s highly regulated policy issuing subsidiaries  as the volume of policies issued increased  b increased personnel costs in all areas  caused by an increase in the number of full time employees from in to in to  in  resulting from the growth of the company s businesses as well as the impact of the company s growth in revenues and profits on employee bonus plans  and c the acquisitions of sbu  hugo trust  avreco  capital management and the hemisphere expansions to boston and ireland 
the charges for income taxes represent effective tax rates of  and 
in through respectively 
the reduced tax rate in and is due to increased earnings outside of the united states 
the tax rate in was reduced further by the provisions on terminated programs 
these factors  plus interest earned on tax fee municipal securities and the tax benefit derived from the exercise of employee stock options  are the major causes of the difference between the expected federal income tax rate in the united states of plus state income taxes and the company s effective rates in the year 
the legion companies  as insurance companies in the united states  are subject to income tax on an accelerated basis and  as a result  a deferred tax benefit was carried on the consolidated balance sheets of million in and 
million in liquidity and capital resources investments at december  the market value of the company s total marketable investments was million  as compared to million at december  in accordance with sfas  investments available for sale are reported at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate component of shareholders equity 
these investments generally consist of investment grade fixed income securities that the company believes are readily marketable and could be liquidated to meet cash requirements  if necessary 
cash flow cash flow from operations has historically provided the company its principal source of liquidity 
the company has continued to produce a positive cash flow with million of cash provided from operations during  as compared to million in and million in cash flow in was adversely affected by delays in recovering reinsurance payments in the company s program business segment but improved in the second half of from the first and second quarters 
the company recently established a million bridge loan facility  million of which was outstanding at december  the company made an additional contribution to the policyholders surplus of its us insurance companies in the amount of million from this facility 
as of december   the company had repurchased million face amount of its convertible exchangeable subordinated debentures due at a cost of million  also from this facility 
the company expects to refinance this bridge loan facility with permanent financing during  and recently filed an s shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission for the future issuance of million of debt and preferred securities 
the company believes that funds generated from operations and available credit will be sufficient to finance its current operations and to fund the repurchase of the remaining convertible exchangeable subordinated debentures as well as the million remaining common shares of the company s million share repurchase authorization 
insurance operations at the end of and  and of the company s total marketable investments were held by the company s policy issuing subsidiaries in the united states 
these companies are restricted by regulation in the amount of dividends they can pay without prior regulatory approval to million in based on results and will continue to face these restrictions in the future 
during they paid a dividend of million 
they are also required to maintain certain deposits with or supply letters of credit to regulatory authorities which totaled million at december  million of deposits and million of letters of credit as compared to million at december  million of deposits and million of letters of credit 
a widely accepted factor used by regulators and rating agencies in evaluating insurance companies is the ratio of net premiums written to policyholders surplus which is an indication of the degree to which an insurer is leveraged 
because of the low level of net premiums written  they have produced a relatively low ratio on this basis of approximately in  in and in and should continue to produce relatively low ratios in the future 
due to the nature of the company s operations  a more appropriate indication of leverage is the ratio of gross premiums written to policyholders surplus  which amounted to in  in and in the national association of insurance commissioners naic has established that an unusual value for this ratio would be or higher 
the company has adopted a policy that this ratio should not exceed the naic has adopted a risk based capital rbc formula to be applied to all property casualty insurance companies 
the formula measures capital and surplus needs based on an insurance company s products and investment portfolio and is to be used as a tool to identify weakly capitalized companies 
an insurance company that does not meet the threshold rbc measurement standards could be required to reduce the scope of its operations and ultimately could become subject to statutory receivership proceedings 
at december  the company s policy issuing subsidiaries met the rbc requirements with a combined required risk based capital of million and an actual adjusted capital of million 
shareholders equity shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase was attributable to net income in  less dividends paid  plus the value of shares issued on the exercise of employee stock options  and the conversion of debentures 
during the total number of common shares outstanding decreased to  from the level of  mainly as a result of the company repurchase of million shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of per share 
this decrease in common shares outstanding for the year was partly offset by the conversion of debentures and the exercise of employee stock options 
total assets total assets increased to billion at december   a increase from billion at december  million  or of total assets in and million  or  in related to assets held in separate accounts 
as detailed in note a to the consolidated financial statements  such assets are principally managed assets attributable to participants in the company s ipc programs 
total assets also increased due to the increase in reinsurance receivables from  million in to  million in this increase  which is largely offset by corresponding increases in the reserve for losses and loss expenses and accounts payable  is due to the greater amount of reinsurance utilized in connection with the company s program business segment 
inflation the company does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation 
the potential adverse impacts of inflation include a a decline in the market value of the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio  b an increase in the ultimate cost of settling claims which remain unresolved for a significant period of time  and c an increase in the company s operating expenses 
however  the company generally holds its fixed maturity investments to maturity and currently believes that an acceptable amount is included in the yield to compensate the company for the risk of inflation 
in addition  any increase from inflation in the ultimate cost of settling unpaid claims will be borne by the company s clients and offset by investment income earned for the benefit of the client during the period that the claim is outstanding 
finally  the increase in operating expenses resulting from inflation should generally be matched by similar inflationary increases in the client s premium and the company s fee income  which includes a fee based upon a percentage of the client s premium 
market sensitive instruments market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from potential change in the value of a financial instrument due to a variety of market conditions 
the company s exposure to market risk is generally limited to potential losses arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates on market values of investment holdings and on a bridging loan 
the company s exposure to movements in exchange rates and equity prices is limited 
the company does not hold or issue significant derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
a interest rate risk interest rate risk results from the company holdings in interest rate sensitive instruments 
the company is exposed to potential losses arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates on fixed rate instruments held 
the company is also exposed to credit spread risk resulting from possible changes in the issuer s credit rating 
to manage its exposure to interest rate risk the company attempts to select investments with characteristics that match the characteristics of the related insurance and contract holder liabilities 
additionally  the company generally only invests in higher grade interest bearing instruments 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk on the million bridging loan  which bears interest at libor plus 
million of this facility was contributed to the us insurance companies and has been invested in a variable rate debt instrument with matching terms and maturity to cover the interest cost of the bridge loan financing 
b foreign exchange risk when the company invests in non us dollar denominated financial instruments it is subject to exposure from exchange rate movements 
this risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign exchange rates will impact adversely upon the value of financial instruments 
due to the company s limited holdings of non us dollar denominated investments  management does not believe the company is exposed to a material risk from exchange rate movements 
c equity price risk equity price risk arises from fluctuations in the value of securities held 
changes in the level or volatility of equity prices affect the value of equity securities held by the company 
management does not believe the company is exposed to a material risk from changes in equity prices due to its limited investment in equity securities 
the tables below provide information about the company s available for sale investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates at december  and respectively 
the tables present expected cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
separate account assets and liabilities are not included in this analysis as gains and losses related to these accounts generally accrue to the program holders 
there were no material quantitative changes in market risk exposure between the current and preceding fiscal year with respect to available for sale investments 
year ended december  expected maturity date total thereafter value fair dollars in millions  except average interest rates assets investments available for sale average interest rate year ended december  expected maturity date total thereafter value fair dollars in millions  except average interest rates assets investments available for sale average interest rate impact of year the company has not experienced any significant year issues to date 
all systems identified for replacement before the year were replaced 
since the company regularly updates its hardware and software  the pure additional cost of year compliance was not material 
the company has taken steps that it believes are reasonably designed to obtain assurances that its critical customers  reinsurance intermediaries  managing general agents  suppliers and others have addressed their year compliance efforts 
although the change in date to year has occurred  it is not possible to conclude that all aspects of the year issue that may affect the company relating to other third party providers have been fully resolved 
the inability of the company s third party providers to properly address the year issue could have an adverse material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
management will continue to monitor the status of and its exposure to this issue  however  the company has not experienced any significant year issues to date 
contingency plans are still in place should critical customers  reinsurance intermediaries  managing general agents  suppliers and others fail to resolve their own year issues 
to date  the company has not been notified of any year related claims
