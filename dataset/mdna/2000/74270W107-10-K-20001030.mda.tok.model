item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
procom develops  manufacturers and markets nas appliances and other storage devices for a wide range of computer networks and operating systems 
our nas appliances  which consist of our dataforce and netforce product lines  provide end users with faster access to data at lower overall cost than other storage alternatives 
we refer to these products collectively as our nas appliances 
in addition  we sell disk drive storage upgrade systems  cd dvd rom servers and arrays and tape backup products  which we refer to collectively as our non nas products 
in the last two years  we have significantly increased our focus on the development and sale of nas appliances 
we continue to develop more advanced nas appliances and expect this business to be our principal business in the future 
we are currently analyzing the market demands and opportunities for all of our non nas products  and hope to transition users of these products to our growing line of more complex  generally higher margin nas solutions 
in december  we executed an agreement with hewlett packard  under which we supply a customized version of our mid range nas appliance hardware and software for hewlett packard for resale 
under the agreement  which has a five year term  and which has no minimum quantity commitments  we expect that hewlett packard will market and support the nas appliances through their distribution channels 
we commenced shipments under the agreement in limited quantities in april changing business mix 
in recent periods  we have experienced significantly reduced demand  revenues and gross margins for our non nas products and we have discontinued some non nas products 
the demand for our cd servers and arrays has declined and we have experienced increased pricing pressures on our disk drive storage upgrade systems  resulting in lower overall revenues and gross margins 
our gross margins vary significantly by product line  and  therefore  our overall gross margin varies with the mix of products we sell 
for example  our sales of cd servers and arrays have historically generated higher gross margins than those of our tape back up and disk drive products 
because recently we have sold  and expect to continue to sell  fewer cd server and arrays  we expect our overall gross margins to be negatively affected 
in future periods  as sales of our higher margin nas appliances increase as a percentage of total sales  we expect our overall gross margins to be positively affected 
our revenues and gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of factors including o new product introductions and enhancements  o competition  o direct versus indirect sales  o the mix and average selling prices of products  and o the cost of labor and components 
revenue and revenue recognition 
we generally record sales upon product shipment 
in the case of sales to most of our distributors  we record sales when the distributor receives the products 
we recognize our product service and support revenues over the terms of their respective contractual periods 
our agreements with many of our vars  system integrators and distributors allow limited product returns  including stock balancing  and price protection privileges 
we maintain reserves  which are adjusted at each financial reporting date  to state fairly the anticipated returns  including stock balancing  and price protection claims relating to each reporting period 
generally  the reserves will increase as sales and corresponding returns increase 
in addition  under a product evaluation program established by us  our indirect channel partners and end users generally are able to purchase appliances on a trial basis and return the appliances within a specified period if they are not satisfied 
we do not record evaluation units as sales until the customer has accepted and paid for these units 
costs and expenses 
our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of components produced by our suppliers  such as disk drives  cabinets  power supplies  controllers and cpus  our direct and indirect labor expenses and related overhead costs such as rent  utilities and manufacturing supplies and other expenses 
in addition  cost of sales includes third party license fees  warranty expenses and reserves for obsolete inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs directly associated with the selling process such as salaries and commissions of sales personnel  marketing  direct and cooperative advertising and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses include our general corporate expenses  such as salaries and benefits  rent  utilities  bad debt expense  legal and other professional fees and expenses  depreciation  and amortization of goodwill 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
our research and development expenses consist of the costs associated with software and hardware development 
specifically  these costs include employee salaries and benefits  consulting fees for contract programmers  test supplies  employee training and other related expenses 
the cost of developing new appliances and substantial enhancements to existing appliances are expensed as incurred 
the following table sets forth consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales for each of the periods indicated year ended july  statement of operations net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development acquired research and development impairment and restructuring charge total operating expenses operating income loss interest income and expense  net income loss  before income taxes provision benefit  for income taxes net income loss fiscal year ended july   compared to fiscal year ended july  net sales 
net sales decreased by to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  this decrease resulted from a significant decrease in unit sales of cd servers and arrays and disk drive storage upgrade systems  combined with the effect of significant price erosion of the average selling price of these products 
we expect to see continued weakness in the demand for our disk drive storage upgrade systems and cd servers and arrays and non nas product sales throughout fiscal  and we may accelerate the discontinuance of our non nas products 
net sales related to our disk based nas appliances increased to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  this increase was primarily the result of increased unit sales of our netforce nas appliances including approximately million in sales to hewlett packard under our five year agreement with them and  to a lesser extent  increased sales of our dataforce nas appliances 
international sales fell to million  or of our net sales  for the year ended july   compared to million  or of our net sales  in the year ended july  while the decrease in absolute dollars was the result of reduced sales of commodity disk drive and tape backup systems internationally  the increase in international sales as a percentage of our net sales was due primarily to reduced us sales of our cd servers and arrays 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million  for the year ended july   from million  for the year ended july  gross margin decreased to of net sales for the year ended july   from of net sales for the year ended july  the decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of the higher percentage of total revenues of our european subsidiaries  which have historically experienced lower margins  and to a lesser extent  a reduction in sales of cd servers and arrays  which have historically experienced higher margins 
in addition  we realized reduced margins on lower sales of disk drive upgrade systems due to competition and price erosion in the disk drive upgrade industry 
we expect further reductions in gross margins due to decreases in sales of some of our higher margin non nas product lines  such as cd servers and arrays  until sales of our nas appliances significantly increase as a percentage of our total sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in the year ended july   from million in the year ended july   and increased as a percentage of net sales to from 
the dollar decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of reduced sales commissions  occasioned by lower gross profit 
in addition  we incurred reduced advertising and marketing costs  and reduced legal fees  offset by increases in the cost of personnel necessary to support our nas sales and marketing efforts 
during the year ended july   we identified and eliminated certain positions and functions not related to our core nas activities 
as a result  we experienced a slight reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal however  we expect overall selling  general and administrative expense to increase in future periods as we plan to substantially increase spending on efforts to market our nas appliances and we expect increased facilities costs  such as utilities  taxes and maintenance  as we utilize our recently completed corporate headquarters 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of net sales  for the year ended july   from million  or of net sales  for the year ended july  these increases were primarily due to compensation expense for additional nas software programmers and hardware developers 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will continue to increase  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  with the expected addition of dedicated nas engineering resources 
interest income expense 
net interest income decreased to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  during fiscal year  we invested the majority of our available cash in investment grade commercial paper with maturities of less than days 
as a result of a decrease in our investable cash position  partially offset by slightly increased interest rates  net interest income decreased in fiscal interest expense for each of the applicable periods includes relatively minor amounts of interest paid on lines of credit maintained by our foreign subsidiaries 
we expect that interest income will be reduced in the future and that interest expense will increase significantly due to the financing of our corporate headquarters  and our need to borrow additional amounts to finance our operations 
provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax benefit rate for the year ended july  was  compared to an effective tax benefit rate of for the same period in fiscal the fiscal benefit approximates the federal and state statutory rates applied to our us operating losses  reduced by unusable foreign operating losses  and adjusted for research and development credits 
the corresponding fiscal effective tax rate reflects the statutory rates and unusable foreign losses  partially offset by research and development tax credits 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our european subsidiaries recorded million in net sales in fiscal without these sales  our consolidated net sales would have decreased by to million 
net sales decreased from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of reduced unit sales for our cd servers and arrays  along with further price reductions on our notebook and desktop disk drive upgrade product lines 
net sales related to our disk based nas appliances increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of increased sales of our newly introduced netforce nas appliances and continued growth in sales of our dataforce nas appliances 
we also recorded million in sales of our cd rom based nas units in fiscal international sales primarily to european customers and secondarily to middle eastern  latin american and pacific rim customers  were million for fiscal and million for fiscal  and accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal and of net sales for fiscal international sales increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales from fiscal to fiscal as a result of the inclusion of net sales of our european subsidiaries 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin decreased to of net sales for fiscal from of net sales for fiscal gross margin decreased in fiscal due primarily to the inclusion of net sales of our german subsidiary  megabyte  which were made at significantly lower gross margins  combined with the effect of pricing pressures on our disk drive storage upgrade systems  and reduced demand for our cd servers and arrays  which typically generated higher gross margins 
gross profit was also adversely affected by increases in our reserves for obsolete inventory due to increased pricing pressures on disk drive products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these expenses represented of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal the dollar increase from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to continued increases in rent  depreciation and administration expenses  costs to support our international infrastructure and additional salaries and payroll related expenses for sales and administration personnel 
in addition  we spent approximately  to successfully defend a lawsuit in fiscal research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these expenses represented of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal the increases were primarily due to compensation expense related to the employment of additional engineering staff and increased expenditures for test prototypes and supplies primarily related to our nas appliances 
impairment and restructuring charge 
in  we acquired the assets of invincible technologies corporation  a massachusetts developer and reseller of high capacity  fault tolerant network storage solutions 
as a result of changes to our business operations  as well as operating losses of invincible  we reviewed the long lived assets purchased in the invincible acquisition 
after comparing the carrying value of the assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the assets  we determined that the carrying values of most of the assets were impaired 
we wrote off approximately million of goodwill remaining from the transaction  and wrote down the carrying value of the invincible fixed assets by million 
in addition  we elected to restructure much of the invincible operations  and recorded a restructuring charge of million for lease termination and employee severance costs relating to the invincible operations 
interest income expense  net 
net interest income was unchanged at million in each of fiscal and fiscal during both years  we invested the majority of our investable cash in investment grade commercial paper with maturities of less than days 
interest income was offset by  in interest expense during fiscal and  in interest expense during fiscal in connection with minor credit lines of our european subsidiaries 
provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax benefit rate for fiscal was  compared to an effective tax provision rate of for fiscal the fiscal effective tax benefit approximates the federal and state statutory rates applied to our us operating losses  reduced by unusable foreign operating losses  and adjusted for research and development credits 
the corresponding fiscal effective tax rate reflects the statutory rates and unusable foreign losses  partially offset by research and development tax credits and foreign sales corporation tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources as of july   we had cash and short term marketable securities totaling million  although million of the short term marketable securities are pledged for a loan  as noted below and therefore generally unavailable to us 
net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash used in operating activities in fiscal resulted from a net loss before non cash charges of million offset in part by a decrease in working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was entirely the result of a decrease in working capital as our net income before non cash charges was negligible 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of net income of million plus non cash charges of million and a slight decrease in working capital 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  while net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was the result of purchases of million to develop our corporate headquarters and million of other property and equipment  offset by million from the maturity of short term marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal resulted from the purchase of million of property and equipment and from million of investments in short term marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal resulted from the purchase of  of property and equipment and the cash cost of acquisitions  net of cash acquired 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from a million increase in a loan payable and million in stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of borrowings of million under a loan offset by net payments of  on our lines of credit and  spent to repurchase common stock 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of net payments made on our lines of credit 
at july   we had established a revolving line of credit with finova capital corporation 
the line had been based on a percentage of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory  up to a maximum of  the line of credit accrued no fees  and interest on outstanding amounts at the lender s prime rate at july  plus 
finova also makes available to us various flooring commitments pursuant to which we may finance the purchase of up to million in inventory less any amounts outstanding in working capital loans from certain of our vendors that have credit arrangements with finova 
the combined line of credit may not exceed million and contains restrictive covenants that  among other provisions  require compliance with certain financial covenants  including the maintenance of working capital of at least  the combined line of credit is collateralized by all our assets 
at july   we were not in compliance with the working capital covenant  and while the lender waived compliance with the covenant  the lender was not making advances under the working capital provisions of the agreement  although the lender was making available up to  in various flooring purchase commitments with various vendors 
at july  and  we owed finova and under the line of credit and  and  under the flooring agreements which is included in accounts payable  respectively see note 
we paid off all amounts outstanding under the finova flooring line in early october subsequent to july   in early october  we entered into a term loan agreement and a three year working capital line of credit with cit business credit 
a term loan of  is due and payable upon our completion of a long term mortgage on our corporate headquarters  or it will be repaid in monthly installments commencing april   while a second term loan of million is due and payable in days 
the term loans bear interest at the lender s prime rate at july   plus  with increases if the loan is not reduced according to a fixed amortization 
the working capital line of credit allows for us to borrow  on a revolving basis  for a period of three years  a specified percentage of our eligible accounts receivable and inventories which would have been approximately million at july   up to a limit of  amounts outstanding under the working capital line bear interest at the lender s prime rate plus 
the lender charged approximately  for the credit facilities  some of which may be refunded if the term loan is paid prior to maturity 
the lines accrue various monthly maintenance  minimum usage and early termination fees 
the lines require certain financial and other covenants  including the maintenance of a minimum ebitda requirement 
the combined lines of credit are collateralized by all our assets 
in addition to the cit lines noted above  subsequent to year end  we replaced the finova flooring line of credit with a flooring line with ibm credit who has committed to make million in flooring inventory commitments available to us 
the flooring line is collateralized by the specific inventory purchased pursuant to the flooring commitments  and the two lenders have entered into an intercreditor agreement which determines the level of priority of either lender s security interest 
the flooring line requires the maintenance by us of a minimum net worth 
in addition to the lines of credit  the company s foreign subsidiaries have lines of credit with two german banks  utilized primarily for overdraft and short term cash needs 
the lines allow megabyte to borrow up to  german marks approximately us  with interest at approximately  and are not guaranteed by procom 
at july  and  there was  dm approximately us  and  german marks approximately us  outstanding under the lines 
also  procom technology  spa maintains two short term lines of credit totaling million lira approximately us  bearing interest at per annum 
no amounts were outstanding under this line at july  we have also borrowed million from an investment bank for months  maturing in september  at which time it can be renewed on a monthly basis  at rates ranging from to 
in september  the loan was renewed for an additional months 
approximately million of our commercial paper portfolio is pledged as collateral for repayment of the loan 
the interest expended under the line of credit is being capitalized as a cost of construction of our new headquarters facility 
in march  we purchased an acre parcel of land for million in irvine  california  for development as our corporate headquarters facility 
construction commenced in late and was completed in late august when we took possession of the facility 
the cost of the land together with the cost of constructing the facility  including capitalized interest and other carrying costs  is approximately million including approximately million in costs expended after july  and approximately million in capitalized interest costs 
we completed and took occupancy of the building in early september we intend to lease  square feet of the building and we are currently considering financing options including a long term mortgage or sale leaseback 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in completing a lease  long term mortgage or sale leaseback on favorable terms  if at all 
on september   our board of directors approved an open market stock repurchase program 
we are authorized to effect repurchases of up to million in shares of our common stock 
we expect to make these repurchases from time to time when we determine that these repurchases are the best available use of our available cash  given the price of our common stock and the interest income we would otherwise earn on our available cash 
we intend to make any repurchases subject to an ongoing buyback program  and currently do not intend to repurchase more shares than the number of shares that are issued pursuant to employee stock option exercises or other employee stock purchase programs 
we have repurchased a total of  shares at an average cost of per share 
no repurchases were made in the year ended july   and the company does not intend to make additional repurchases 
in september  the company s board terminated the repurchase program 
as of july   we had cash and short term marketable securities balances of million  although million of the short term marketable securities included in cash are pledged as collateral for the short term real estate loan noted above 
subsequent to july   we entered into a term loan line of credit agreement with cit  as described above 
we expect to have sufficient cash generated from operations through availability under lines of credit and through other sources to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months

risk factors before investing in our common stock  you should be aware that there are risks inherent in our business  including those indicated below 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business could be harmed 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you might lose all or part of your investment 
you should carefully consider the following factors as well as the other information in this report on form k 
if growth in the nas market does not meet our expectations  our future financial performance could suffer 
we believe our future financial performance will depend in large part upon the continued growth in the nas market and on emerging standards in this market 
we intend for nas products to be our primary business 
the market for nas products  however  may not continue to grow 
long term trends in storage technology remain unclear and some analysts have questioned whether competing technologies  such as storage area networks  may emerge as the preferred storage solution 
if the nas market grows more slowly than anticipated  or if nas products based on emerging standards other than those adopted by us become increasingly accepted by the market  our operating results could be harmed 
if we fail to successfully manage our transition to a focus on nas products  our business and prospects would be harmed 
we began developing nas products in since then  we have focused our efforts and resources on our nas business  and we intend to continue to do so 
we expect to continue to wind down our non nas product development and marketing efforts 
in the interim  we expect to continue to rely in large part upon sales of our non nas products to fund operating and development expenses 
net sales of our non nas products have been declining in amount and as a percentage of our overall net sales  and we expect these declines to continue 
if the decline in net sales of our non nas products varies significantly from our expectations  or the decline in net sales of our non nas products is not substantially offset by increases in sales of our nas products  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our operations or to develop our nas business 
we also expect our transition to a nas focused business to require us to continue o engaging in significant marketing and sales efforts to achieve market awareness as a nas vendor  o reallocating resources in product development and service and support of our nas appliances  o modifying existing and entering into new channel partner relationships to include sales of our nas appliances  and o expanding and reconfiguring manufacturing operations 
in addition  we may face unanticipated challenges in implementing our transition to a nas focused company 
we may not be successful in managing any anticipated or unanticipated challenges associated with this transition 
moreover  we expect to continue to incur costs in addressing these challenges  and there is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient revenues to cover these costs 
if we fail to successfully implement our transition to a nas focused company  our business and prospects would be harmed 
our agreement with hewlett packard company may not generate significant net sales  and we may not be able to enter into other business alliances in the future 
we believe our agreement with hewlett packard company is an important element of our strategy to increase penetration in the nas market 
however  hewlett packard has not currently made significant purchase commitments for our products  and there is no minimum purchase commitment under the agreement 
in addition  because the hewlett packard agreement is relatively new  we do not have a history upon which to base an estimate of future net sales under the agreement 
we do not currently  and may never  generate significant net sales under this agreement 
finally  the hewlett packard agreement has a five year term  and there is no assurance that the agreement can or will be renewed 
one of our key strategies is to enter into additional business alliances in the future  including oem arrangements and joint development and joint marketing arrangements  with other vendors that sell complementary products 
however  we may not be able to do so  and any business alliances may not generate significant or profitable net sales 
if we fail to increase the number of direct and indirect sales channels for our nas products  our ability to increase net sales may be limited 
in order to grow our business  we will need to increase market awareness and sales of our nas appliances 
to achieve these objectives  we believe it will be necessary to increase the number of our direct and indirect sales channels 
we plan to significantly increase the number of our direct sales personnel 
however  there is intense competition for these professionals  and we may not be able to attract and retain sufficient new sales personnel 
we also plan to expand revenues from our indirect sales channels  including distributors  vars  oems and systems integrators 
to do this  we will need to modify and expand our existing relationships with these indirect channel partners  as well as enter into new indirect sales channel relationships 
we may not be successful in accomplishing these objectives 
if we are unable to expand our direct or indirect sales channels  our ability to increase revenues may be limited 
because we do not have exclusive relationships with our distributors or resellers  these customers may give higher priority to products of competitors  which could harm our operating results 
our distributors and resellers generally offer products of several different companies  including products of our competitors 
accordingly  these distributors and resellers may give higher priority to products of our competitors  which could harm our operating results 
in addition  our distributors and resellers often demand additional significant selling concessions and inventory rights  such as limited return rights and price protection 
we cannot assure you that sales to our distributors or resellers will continue  or that these sales will be profitable 
because of our limited operating history in the nas market  which is new and rapidly evolving  our historical financial information is of limited value in projecting our future operating results or prospects 
we have been manufacturing and selling our nas products for only approximately three years 
for the year ended july   these products accounted for less than of our total net sales 
we expect sales of our nas products to represent an increasing percentage of our net sales in the future 
because of our limited operating history  as well as the rapidly evolving nature of the nas market  it is difficult to evaluate our business or our prospects 
in particular  our historical financial information is of limited value in projecting our future operating results 
our markets are intensely competitive  and if we are unable to compete effectively  we may lose market share or be required to reduce prices 
the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins or loss of market share  any of which could harm our operating results 
we compete with other nas companies  direct selling storage providers and smaller vendors that provide storage solutions to end users 
in our non nas markets  we compete with computer manufacturers that provide storage upgrades for their own products  as well as with manufacturers of hard drives  cd servers and arrays and storage upgrade products 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products  and reduce prices to increase market share 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
in addition  new technologies may increase competitive pressures 
we depend on a few customers for a substantial portion of our net sales and accounts receivable  and changes in the timing and size of these customers orders may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
three customers accounted for approximately and of the company s total accounts receivable at july  and july   respectively  and one individual customer accounted for approximately and of the company s net sales for fiscal and in these periods  we sold our non nas products principally to distributors and master resellers such as ingram micro  tech data  custom edge previously inacom and compucom 
unless and until we diversify and expand our customer base for nas products  our future success will depend to a large extent on the timing and size of future purchase orders  if any  from these customers 
if we lose a major customer  our results of operation could be harmed 
we cannot be certain that customers that have accounted for significant revenues in past periods will continue to purchase our products in future periods 
our gross margins have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly  thereby harming our results of operations 
historically  our gross margins have fluctuated significantly 
our gross margins vary significantly by product line and distribution channel  and  therefore  our overall gross margin varies with the mix of products we sell 
our markets are characterized by intense competition and declining average unit selling prices over the course of the relatively short life cycles of individual products 
for example  we derive a significant portion of our sales from disk drives  cd servers and arrays  and storage upgrade products 
the market for these products is highly competitive and subject to intense pricing pressures 
sales of disk drive upgrade systems generally generate lower gross margins than those of our nas products 
if we fail to increase sales of our nas appliances  we believe our overall gross margins will continue to decline 
our gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of other factors  including o new product introductions and enhancements  o competition  o changes in the distribution channels we use  o the mix and average selling prices of products  and o the cost and availability of components and manufacturing labor 
if we are unable to introduce new products  or if our products fail to keep pace with technological changes in the markets we serve  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to successfully develop and introduce new hardware and software for the nas market 
due to the complexity of products such as ours  and the difficulty in estimating the engineering effort required to produce new products  we face significant challenges in developing and introducing new products 
we may be unable to introduce new products on a timely basis or at all 
if we are unable to introduce new products in a timely manner  our operating results could be harmed 
even if we are successful in introducing new products  we may be unable to keep pace with technological changes in our markets and our products may not gain any meaningful market acceptance 
the markets we serve are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements that could render our products obsolete and less competitive 
as a result  our position in these markets could erode rapidly due to changes in features and functions of competing products or price reductions by our competitors 
in order to avoid product obsolescence  we will have to keep pace with rapid technological developments and emerging industry standards 
we may not be successful in doing so  and if we fail in this regard  our operating results could be harmed 
we rely upon a limited number of suppliers for some of the components used in our products  and any disruption or termination of these supply arrangements could delay shipment of our products and harm our operating results 
we rely upon a limited number of suppliers of several key components used in our products  including disk drives  computer boards  power supplies and microprocessors 
in the past  we have experienced periodic shortages  selective supply allocations and increased prices for these and other components 
we may experience similar supply issues in the future 
even if we are able to obtain component supplies  the quality of these components may not meet our requirements 
for example  in order to meet our product performance requirements  we must obtain disk drives of extremely high quality and capacity 
even a small deviation from our requirements could render any of the disk drives we receive unusable by us 
in the event of a reduction or interruption in the supply or a degradation in quality of any of our components  we may not be able to complete the assembly of our products on a timely basis or at all  which could force us to delay or reduce shipments of our products 
if we were forced to delay or reduce product shipments  our operating results could be harmed 
in addition  product shipment delays could adversely affect our relationships with our channel partners and current or future end users 
undetected defects or errors found in our products  or the failure of our products to properly interface with the products of other vendors  may result in delays  increased costs or failure to achieve market acceptance  which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
complex products such as those we develop and offer may contain defects or errors  or may fail to properly interface with the products of other vendors  when first introduced or as new versions are released 
despite internal testing and testing by our customers or potential customers  we do  from time to time  and may in the future encounter these problems in our existing or future products 
any of these problems may o cause delays in product introductions and shipments  o result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  o require design modifications  or o decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with these products  which could result in product returns 
in addition  we may not find errors or failures in our products until after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could significantly harm our operating results 
our current or potential customers might seek or succeed in recovering from us any losses resulting from errors or failures in our products 
if we are unable to manage our international operations effectively  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
net sales to our international customers  including export sales from the united states  accounted for approximately of our net sales for the year ended july  and approximately of our net sales for the fiscal year ended july  we believe that our growth and profitability will require successful expansion of our international operations to which we have committed significant resources 
our international operations will expose us to operational challenges that we would not otherwise face if we conducted our operations only in the united states 
these include o currency exchange rate fluctuations  particularly when we sell our products in denominations other than us dollars  o difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles  o reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  particularly in asia  o legal uncertainties regarding tariffs  export controls and other trade barriers  o the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  and o seasonal fluctuations in purchasing patterns in other countries  particularly in europe 
any of these factors could have an adverse impact on our existing international operations and business or impair our ability to continue expanding into international markets 
in addition  in order to successfully expand our international sales  we must strengthen foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international distributors and resellers 
expanding internationally and managing the financial and business operations of our foreign subsidiaries will also require significant management attention and financial resources 
for example  our foreign subsidiaries in europe have incurred operational losses 
to the extent that we are unable to address these concerns in a timely manner  our growth  if any  in international sales will be limited  and our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
our proprietary software relies on our intellectual property  and any failure by us to protect our intellectual property could enable our competitors to market products with similar features that may reduce demand for our products  which would adversely affect our net sales 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary software or technology 
we believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our business 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets and a patent to protect our proprietary rights 
in addition  we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and license agreements with end users and control access to our source code and other intellectual property 
we have applied for the registration of some  but not all  of our trademarks 
we have applied for one us patent with respect to the design of our netforce product  and we anticipate that we will apply for additional patents 
it is possible that no patents will issue from our currently pending applications 
new patent applications may not result in issued patents and may not provide us with any competitive advantages over  or may be challenged by  third parties 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries  and the enforcement of those laws  do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any patent issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
this litigation  whether or not it is resolved in our favor  could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
we may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights or claims that our own trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid  and if we were to subsequently lose our intellectual property rights  our business would be materially adversely affected 
we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties intellectual property rights or claims that our own trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid 
we expect that companies in our markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
the resolution of any claims of this nature  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could harm our operating results 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the loss of access to any key intellectual property right could harm our business 
our net sales and operating results may fluctuate significantly  and any fluctuations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in recent periods  we have experienced significant declines in net sales and gross profit and incurred operating losses  causing our quarterly operating results to vary significantly 
if we fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts  as well as our internal operating goals  as a result of any future fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
our net sales and quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors 
these factors include o market acceptance of our new products and product enhancements or those of our competitors  o the level of competition in our target product markets  o delays in our introduction of new products  o changes in sales volumes through our distribution channels  which have varying commission and sales discount structures  o changing technological needs within our target product markets  o the impact of price competition on the selling prices for our non nas products  which continue to represent a majority of our net sales  o the availability and pricing of our product components  o our expenditures on research and development and the cost to expand our sales and marketing programs  and o the volume  mix and timing of orders received 
due to these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  it is difficult for us to forecast accurately our future net sales 
this difficulty results from our limited operating history in the emerging nas market  as well as the fact that product sales in any quarter are generally booked and shipped in that quarter 
because we incur expenses  many of which are fixed  based in part on our expectations of future sales  our operating results may be disproportionately affected if sales levels are below our expectations 
our revenues in any quarter may also be affected by product returns and any warranty obligations in that quarter 
many of our distribution and reseller customers have limited return rights 
in addition  we generally extend warranties to our customers that correspond to the warranties provided by our suppliers 
if returns exceed applicable reserves or if a supplier were to fail to meet its warranty obligations  we could incur significant losses 
in fiscal  we experienced a product return rate 
this rate may vary significantly in the future  and we cannot assure you that our reserves for product returns will be adequate in any future period 
if we are unable to attract qualified personnel or retain our executive officers and other key personnel  we may not be able to compete successfully 
our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified technical and sales personnel 
competition for qualified engineers and sales personnel  particularly in orange county  california  is intense  and we may not be able to compete effectively to retain and attract qualified  experienced employees 
should we lose the services of a significant number of our engineers or sales people  we may not be able to compete successfully in our targeted markets and our business would be harmed 
we believe that our success will depend on the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees 
in particular  we rely on the services of our four founders  messrs 
razmjoo  alaghband  aydin and shahrestany 
we maintain employment agreements with each of our founders 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on these individuals 
the loss of any of these executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 
we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability  and our failure to do so could require us to seek additional financing  which may not be available to us on favorable or any terms 
in recent periods  we have experienced significant declines in net sales and gross profit  and we have incurred operating losses 
we incurred operating losses of million for fiscal and million for fiscal we expect to continue to incur operating losses 
as part of our strategy to focus on the nas market  we plan to significantly increase our direct sales force and to increase our investment in research and development and marketing efforts 
we will need to significantly increase our revenues from our nas products to achieve and maintain profitability 
the revenue and profit potential of these products is unproven 
we may not be able to generate significant or any revenues from our nas products or achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
in addition  we have invested substantial cash in our new corporate headquarters 
if we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability in the future  we will have to seek additional financing in the future  which may not be available to us on favorable or any terms 
control by our existing shareholders could discourage potential acquisitions of our business that other shareholders may consider favorable 
our executive officers  directors and or greater shareholders and their affiliates own  shares  or approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
acting together  these shareholders would be able to exert substantial influence on matters requiring approval by shareholders  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquiror from attempting to obtain control of us  which could in turn have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock 
the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future  which could result in a decline in your investment s value 
the market price for our common stock has been volatile in the past  and particularly volatile in the last twelve months  and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future 
the value of your investment in our common stock could decline due to the impact of any of the above or of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock o fluctuations in our operating results  o fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us  o a shortfall in net sales or operating results compared to securities analysts expectations  o changes in analysts recommendations or projections  o announcements of new products  applications or product enhancements by us or our competitors  and o changes in our relationships with our suppliers or customers 
in addition  the stock market has experienced substantial price and volume volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies and that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of these companies 
as a result  any broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
some provisions of california law and of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage potential third party acquirors or those who might seek to change our management 
some provisions of california law and of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition even if a change in the ownership of our company or changes in our management would be beneficial to our shareholders 
this may reduce the market price of our common stock 
a summary of these provisions in our articles and bylaws is included in description of capital stock anti takeover provisions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio as well as the fluctuation in interest rates on our various borrowing arrangements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest in high credit quality issuers and  by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure reasonable portfolio liquidity 
as discussed elsewhere in this report on form k  we have developed our headquarters in irvine  california and we have spent approximately million to complete the facility 
the company is seeking long term mortgage financing for all or some of the facility cost during the next fiscal year 
the company has not locked in a commitment  and may therefore find such financing to be much more expensive as a result 
since july   we have entered into a line of credit and term loan agreements pursuant to which amounts outstanding bear interest at the lender s prime rate plus 
accordingly  since we anticipate that we will be borrowing funds under such agreements  we expect that we will experience interest rate risk on our debt 
foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in various foreign countries  but we only have significant assets deployed outside the united states in germany 
we have effected intercompany advances and sold goods to megabyte as well as our subsidiaries in italy and switzerland denominated in us dollars  and those amounts are subject to currency fluctuation  and require constant revaluation on our financial statements 
during the years ended july   and  we incurred approximately   and  in foreign currency losses which are included in our selling  general and administrative costs 
we do not operate a hedging program to mitigate the effect of a significant rapid change in the value of the german mark compared to the us dollar 
if such a change did occur  we would have to take into account a currency exchange gain or loss in the amount of the change in the us dollar denominated balance of the amounts outstanding at the time of such change 
at july   approximately million in current intercompany advances and accounts receivable from our foreign subsidiaries were outstanding 
there can be no assurance that such a loss would not have an adverse material effect on our results of operations or financial condition
