sales from discontinued operations decreased  or primarily as a result of the disposition of bach simpson  ltd  in january of  diehl machines  inc  in may of  and peters machinery  inc  in september of all of the companies included in discontinued operations had been disposed of as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the group s operating loss decreased  or primarily as a result of the dispositions described above 
corporate expenses increased  or 
this increase was primarily a result of allocating certain employees salaries and related costs to the corporate segment for the year ended december  corporate expenses also included  of costs associated with the potential sale of the electrical electronics segment 
identifiable assets at corporate decreased primarily as a result of lower cash levels at year end 
although the results of these operating groups can be significantly affected by the strength of the general economy  the company believes that it has positioned itself well in segments that can be expanded both externally through acquisitions and internally through new products  operational improvements and increased market penetrations 
following is a discussion concerning other factors that affected the company s net income 
gross profit from continuing operations increased  or as gross margin percentages increased to from in the increase in gross profit is primarily a result of the contico acquisition in january of gross margins in were negatively impacted by  as a result of the adoption of lifo inventory accounting for its contico subsidiary acquired in january of the lifo method is not used by any other subsidiary and was not used by katy in or the increased expense due to lifo accounting resulted from price increases for the thermoplastic resins  a significant raw material in the contico production process 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or in compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales to in from for the same period in the increase was primarily a result of the increased amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the acquisitions during and the first part of combined with the restructuring charge  costs related to the potential sale of the electrical electronics group and costs to restructure contico s outside sales force 
interest expense increased substantially for compared to  as a result of increased interest expense associated with bank borrowings to fund the company s acquisitions

operating income for the group increased  or 
excluding the increased volumes associated with the woods canada acquisition  operating income increased 
this increase was attributable to increased margins in the specialty metal business resulting from favorable product mix 
these increases were partially offset by lower volumes associated with the line reviews discussed above and higher selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales in the electric corded products and electrical components  parts and accessories businesses 
consolidation and intense pricing pressures by national distributors had a negative impact on both revenues and margins in the electrical components  parts and accessories businesses

although the results of these operating groups can be significantly affected by the strength of the general economy  the company believes that it has positioned itself well in segments that can be expanded both externally through acquisitions particularly in the electrical electronics and maintenance products areas  and internally through new products  operational improvements and increased market penetrations 
following is a discussion concerning other factors that affected the company s net income 
gross profit from continuing operations increased  or as gross margins increased slightly to from in while selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or in compared to the prior year 
the increase in gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses is attributable to both the increased volumes and the acquisition activity previously mentioned 
interest expense increased  from primarily as a result of the borrowings associated with the acquisition of wilen in august of interest income decreased slightly due to the company maintaining lower average cash and cash equivalent balances during compared to other  net in was income of  versus income of  in the increase was a result of the company receiving past due balances on previously written off investments

excluding these items  the income from continuing operations before income taxes increased  primarily as a result of increased operating income from both the electrical electronics and the maintenance products groups 
provision for income taxes in was  or an effective tax rate of and  or an effective tax rate of in liquidity and capital resources combined cash and cash equivalents decreased to  on december   from  on december   mostly due to maintaining a lower cash balance due to better application of cash against long term debt at year end 
excluding the current year acquisitions  cash flow from operations was substantial enough to cover liquidity and capital resource requirements 
current ratios were to and to at december  and  respectively 
working capital increased to  on december   from  on december  this increase is attributable to the contico acquisition in january of excluding this acquisition  working capital decreased approximately 
at december   katy had short and long term indebtedness of  substantially all of which was outstanding under an unsecured revolving credit agreement

also  on february   the company s board of directors authorized management to spend up to  over a twelve month period for the repurchase of katy common stock in the open market 
the company expects to meet these cash requirements through the use of available cash and internally generated funds 
the revolving credit agreement has certain covenants which limit the company s borrowing capacity 
in addition to constantly striving for improved earnings results  the company is focusing on further improving its management of working capital to ensure optimal utilization of its assets 
the company s financial plans for focus on efforts in both of these areas 
management continuously reviews each of its businesses 
as a result of these ongoing reviews  management may determine to sell certain companies and may augment its remaining businesses with acquisitions 
when sales do occur  management anticipates that funds from these sales will be used for general corporate purposes or to fund acquisitions 
acquisitions may also be funded through cash balances  available lines of credit and future borrowings 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
restructuring and evaluation of alternatives for electrical electronics segment in june  the company announced a restructuring plan for its electrical electronics businesses as a result of weaker than expected sales performance and lower margins 
the restructuring plan included i making substantial cost reductions in these operations  ii intensifying the marketing and product development efforts initiated earlier in the year  and  iii accelerating the consolidation of operations within the segment begun earlier in the second quarter 
the cost of this restructuring  which includes severance costs related to the elimination of management employees  resulted in a pre tax charge to earnings in the second quarter of approximately  additionally  plant personnel levels were reduced in excess of persons and unfilled administrative positions were eliminated 
concurrently  the company announced that it retained donaldson  lufkin jenrette securities corporation to assist in exploring strategic alternatives relating to the electrical electronics businesses  including the possible sale thereof 
prior to year end  the company announced that after reviewing various alternatives  it had decided to retain the electrical electronic businesses 
the company believes that with the consolidation of gc electronics and waldom electronics  and the restructuring and branding initiatives at woods  substantially more value exists in these businesses than could be translated into a fair offer at the time alternatives were being evaluated 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and requires that those assets and liabilities be measured at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 which delays the required implementation of statement no 
to years beginning after september  while the company is still evaluating the potential effect of this statement  its adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
environmental and other contingencies in december  banco del atlantico  a bank located in mexico  filed a lawsuit against woods  a subsidiary of the company  and against certain past and then present officers and directors and former owners of woods  alleging that the defendants participated in a violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act involving allegedly fraudulently obtained loans from mexican banks  including the plaintiff  and money laundering of the proceeds of the illegal enterprise 
all of the foregoing is alleged to have occurred prior to the company s purchase of woods 
the plaintiff also alleges that it made loans to an entity controlled by certain officers and directors based upon fraudulent representations 
the plaintiff seeks to hold woods liable for its alleged damage under principles of respondeat superior and successor liability 
the plaintiff is claiming damages in excess of  and is requesting treble damages under the statutes 
the defendants have filed a motion  which has not been ruled on  to dismiss this action on jurisdictional grounds 
because the litigation is in preliminary stages  it is not possible at this time for the company to determine an outcome or reasonably estimate the range of potential exposure 
the company may have recourse against the former owner of woods and others for  among other things  violations of covenants  representations and warranties under the purchase agreement through which the company acquired woods  and under state  federal and common law 
in addition  the purchase price under the purchase agreement may be subject to adjustment as a result of the claims made by banco del atlantico 
the extent or limit of any such recourse cannot be predicted at this time 
katy also has a number of product liability and workers compensation claims pending against it and its subsidiaries 
many of these claims are proceeding through the litigation process and the final outcome will not be known until a settlement is reached with the claimant or the case is adjudicated 
it can take up to years from the date of the injury to reach a final outcome for such claims 
with respect to the product liability and workers compensation claims  katy has provided for its share of expected losses beyond the applicable insurance coverage  including those incurred but not reported  which are developed using actuarial techniques 
such accruals are developed using currently available claim information  and represent management s best estimates 
the ultimate cost of any individual claim can vary based upon  among other factors  the nature of the injury  the duration of the disability period  the length of the claim period  the jurisdiction of the claim and the nature of the final outcome 
the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency  state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at a number of hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund or equivalent state laws and  as such  may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at these sites 
responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
under the federal superfund statute  parties could be held jointly and severally liable  thus subjecting them to potential individual liability for the entire cost of cleanup at the site 
based on its estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent  public companies  will fully pay the costs apportioned to them  currently available information concerning the scope of contamination  estimated remediation costs  estimated legal fees and other factors  the company has recorded and accrued for indicated environmental liabilities in the aggregate amount of approximately  at december  the ultimate cost will depend on a number of factors and the amount currently accrued represents management s best current estimate of the total cost to be incurred 
the company expects this amount to be substantially paid over the next one to four years 
the most significant environmental matters in which the company is currently involved are as follows in  the united states environmental protection agency usepa initiated a unilateral administrative order proceeding under section of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra against wj smith and katy 
the proceeding requires certain actions at the wj smith site and certain off site areas  as well as development and implementation of additional cleanup activities to mitigate off site releases 
in december  wj smith  katy and usepa agreed to resolve the proceeding through an administrative order on consent under section of rcra 
pursuant to the order  wj smith is currently implementing a cleanup to mitigate off site releases 
during  the company reached agreement with the oregon department of environmental quality odeq as to a cleanup plan for pcb contamination at the medford  oregon facility of the former standard transformer division of american gage 
the agreement required the company to pay  of the first  in cleanup costs 
those funds were expended in another former occupant of the site  balteau standard  inc was responsible for the remaining  of the first  and the next  in cleanup costs above the  the parties are now sharing equally in cleanup costs 
katy believes the cleanup plan has been successful and has requested that the odeq inspect and approve the remediation work 
katy has received such approval with respect to a portion of the cleanup plan 
further monitoring of groundwater and testing and cleanup of adjacent property may be required before approval can be obtained with respect to the remainder of the plan 
pending such approval  the liability of katy and its subsidiary cannot be determined at this time 
although management believes that these actions individually and in the aggregate are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company  further costs could be significant and will be recorded as a charge to operations when such costs become probable and reasonably estimable 
year the year issue was a problem that has a potentially material adverse impact on the company as well as governments  businesses  and individuals throughout the world 
the year issue related to computer programs and microchips that may not have been able to properly recognize the first two digits of a year  beginning after december  the problem was thought to have the potential to disrupt the operation of products and services that rely on these computer programs or microchips 
based on assessment activities conducted by the company beginning in regarding the year problem  the company determined that the modification or replacement of a moderate number of computer programs and microchips was required 
the changes required were necessary for a wide variety of assets which included  but were not limited to  computer hardware and software  production machinery and phone systems 
the company believes that it identified the major sources of potential internal year issues and implemented a company wide year remediation program the yk program during which included the performance of due diligence procedures for all acquisitions made by the company 
the company had completed the yk program as of december  the company believes that the yk program mitigated all known significant potential internal year problems 
the company will continue to investigate additional year risks as they come to the attention of the company 
while the company has not been informed of  nor experienced any problems with  any material risks associated with its critical suppliers  financial institutions  public utilities and other entities  there is no guarantee of the year readiness of those entities or the potential material adverse effect on the company 
the company has expensed approximately  of costs incurred to date related to the yk program and does not expect material costs in the future 
outlook for net sales are expected to increase in over  due to the introduction of new products and core growth in the maintenance products group and the resurgence of business in the electrical electronics group after s results  which were significantly impacted by the loss of business announced in november of cost of goods sold are expected to be negatively impacted in by higher costs for polyethlylene  polypropylene  and other thermoplastic resins based on price levels in early that are used in the company s production processes  especially at contico 
prices for copper  a significant raw material in the electrical electronics group  may also increase in the company anticipates mitigating these costs by creating efficiencies in and improvements to its production processes 
selling  general and administrative costs are expected to remain stable from levels 
interest expense is also expected to be relatively stable in  with lower debt levels offset by expected higher interest rates 
the effective tax rate for is not expected to differ significantly from the federal statutory rate 
the above factors indicate that full year results from continuing segments for will be comparable to while many factors will impact the eventual results  an important component will certainly be the impact of plastic resin costs 
improved results for will depend on either softening resin prices or the company achieving price increases on resin based and other products

the company s inability to reduce manufacturing costs 
the inability of the company to achieve product price increases  especially as they relate to potentially higher raw material costs
