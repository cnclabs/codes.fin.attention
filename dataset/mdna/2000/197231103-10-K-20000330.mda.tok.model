item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction from its origins as a one branch bank in the dalles  columbia has grown as a result of merger and acquisition activity  new branch openings  the introduction of new business lines  and the expansion and cross marketing of its existing products and community bank lending expertise 
in  crb merged with juniper banking company  and in columbia was formed as crb s holding company 
in  columbia acquired washington based klickitat valley bank 
further growth came from crb s hood river and bend branch openings  and from the expansion in of crb s residential mortgage business 
in november  columbia acquired valley community bank  and in september crb opened a new branch in hermiston  oregon 
in  crb opened a new branch in pendleton  oregon in january  completed construction and opened a second bend branch in august  and opened its first branch in newberg  oregon in november 
collectively  these growth and acquisition activities have enabled columbia to diversify its portfolio and its operating risk over several market areas and local economies 
columbia s goal is to grow its earning assets while maintaining a high return on equity and keeping asset quality high 
the key to this  in columbia s view  is to emphasize personal  quality banking products and services for its customers  to hire and retain competent branch management and administrative personnel  and to respond quickly to customer demand and growth opportunities 
columbia also intends to increase its market penetration in its existing markets  and to expand into new markets through further suitable acquisitions and through new branch openings 
columbia s goal continues to be to increase earning assets without compromising its commitment to high asset quality

net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loan and investment security portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread  and margin 
volume refers to the dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to total average interest earning assets and is influenced by the relative level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

analysis of changes in interest differential 
the following table shows the dollar amount of the increase decrease in columbia s net interest income and expense and attributes such dollar amounts to changes in volume as well as changes in rates

these results were primarily due to an increase in the volume of earning assets and the growth of noninterest bearing deposits 
for the three year period through  the average yield on earning assets decreased while rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased by 
average loans increased while average noninterest bearing deposits increased 
total interest earning assets averaged million for the year ended december   compared to million for the corresponding period in most of the increase was due to an increase in loans 
increases in the loan portfolio are attributed to the acquisition of valley community bank  opportunities afforded by the banking industry s consolidation and closure of competitors branches in columbia s market areas  and the hiring of additional senior lending personnel in strategic locations 
interest bearing liabilities averaged million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period in although further competitive pressure is expected in expanding deposit relationships  management  as a matter of policy  does not seek to attract high priced  brokered deposits 
in the near term  management does not anticipate columbia s net interest margins will be significantly impacted by competitive pressure for deposit accounts 
loans  which generally carry a higher yield than investment securities and other earning assets  comprised of average earning assets during  compared to in and in during the same periods  average yields on loans were in  in  and in investment securities comprised of average earning assets in  which was down from in and in tax equivalent interest yields on investment securities have ranged from in to in and in interest cost  as a percentage of earning assets  decreased to in  compared to in and in local competitive pricing conditions and funding needs for columbia s investments in loans have been the primary determinants of rates paid for deposits during these three years 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents charges made to earnings to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is maintained at an amount believed to be sufficient to absorb losses in the loan portfolio 
factors considered in establishing an appropriate allowance include a careful assessment of the financial condition of the borrower  a realistic determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral  the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower  a comprehensive analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories  and a review of delinquent and classified loans 
columbia applies a systematic process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  including an internal loan review function and a quarterly analysis of the adequacy of the allowance 
the quarterly analysis includes determination of specific potential loss factors on individual classified loans  historical potential loss factors derived from actual net charge off experience and trends in nonperforming loans  and potential loss factors for other loan portfolio risks such as loan concentrations  the condition of the local economy  and the nature and volume of loans 
the recorded values of loans actually removed from the consolidated balance sheets are referred to as charge offs and  after netting out recoveries on previously charged off assets  become net charge offs 
columbia s policy is to charge off loans when  in management s opinion  the loan or a portion thereof is deemed uncollectible  although concerted efforts are made to maximize recovery after the charge off 
when a charge to the loan loss provision is recorded  the amount is based on past charge off experience  a careful analysis of the current portfolio  and an evaluation of economic trends in columbia s market areas 
management will continue to closely monitor the loan quality of new and existing relationships through stringent review and evaluation procedures and by making loan officers accountable for collection efforts 
for the years ended december  through  columbia charged million  million and  respectively  to its provision for loan losses 
the increase in over the provision for loan losses recorded in was necessary to accommodate the growth in columbia s loan portfolio  to establish a reserve for potential losses consistent with revisions in columbia s loan policy  and to replenish the allowance for loan losses for charge offs incurred during during the last three years  average outstanding loans grew and the allowance for loan losses kept pace by increasing through charges to the provision for loan losses 
columbia s increase in the provision for loan losses has primarily been a function of strong loan demand and the resulting growth in the loan portfolio 
for the year ended december   loan charge offs exceeded recoveries by  as compared to  when loan charge offs exceeded recoveries by  nearly one third of the loss experienced in was due to a loss from one loan 
all remaining net charge offs incurred by columbia were smaller in amount and generally distributed evenly among all other branch locations 
noninterest income total noninterest income increased through year end over and over this three year period  noninterest income has increased from million in  to million in  and to million in noninterest income is primarily derived from service charges and related fees  as well as mortgage origination and processing fees 
such income increased million  or for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the principal reason for this increase was income generated by columbia s mortgage lending division  which was formed in september of  and which operates under the name columbia river bank mortgage group 
for the year ended  this division generated million in income from originating  processing  servicing  and selling mortgage loans 
the increase was also the result of increasing deposit volumes and related service fees 
service charges were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  management attributes this increase to the increase in customers served at all of columbia s branches 
the remainder of the increase in noninterest income is primarily attributable to improved revenues received from credit card discounts and fees  investment fee income provided by columbia s financial services department and other noninterest fees and charges 
noninterest expense noninterest expenses consist principally of employees salaries and benefits  occupancy costs  data processing expenses and other noninterest expenses 
a measure of columbia s ability to contain noninterest expenses is the efficiency ratio 
for the year ended december   the cash basis efficiency ratio had slipped to compared to for the corresponding period of the decline in the efficiency ratio primarily reflects increased expenses 
noninterest expense was million for the year ended december   an increase from million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  this was due to an increase in staffing costs  as well as increases in other key operating costs such as occupancy expense  data processing expenses and other noninterest expense 
the additional expenses related primarily to costs associated with the opening of three branches in as well as one time non recurring charges in for yk compliance  a technology study and the combination of the two subsidiary banks 
in  columbia s total noninterest expense was of net revenues  while in and it was and  respectively  of net revenues 
salary and benefit expense was million in  million in  and million in as of december   columbia had full time equivalent employees  which compares to as of december  and as of december  the increase in this expense category was the result of additional staffing in the new newberg  hermiston and pendleton branches and the normal expense increases associated with maintaining an expanded employee base 
net occupancy expense consists of depreciation on premises and equipment  maintenance and repair expenses  utilities  and related expenses 
columbia s net occupancy expense increased steadily over the three year period 
this expense category was million in  an increase of  or  over the  reported in from to  net occupancy expense increased by  from  to million  an increase of 
these increases reflect the operation of the five additional branches and the formation in of the columbia river bank mortgage group 
this also reflects the costs relating to continued investment in columbia s computer systems  which have been upgraded throughout the organization 
fdic insurance premiums are a function of outstanding deposit liabilities 
because the bank insurance fund has since been adequately capitalized  columbia was required to make only nominal premium payments in  and for the three year period ended december   columbia paid the lowest premium available for its deposit insurance coverage 
other noninterest expense increases arose from investments in technology and data processing  and in new service delivery channels to enable columbia to continue its focus on efficient  personal service 
data processing expenses increased in over the previous year  which reflects both the growth of columbia s customer and account base and ongoing upgrades to the data processing operations 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in  million in and million in the provision resulted in effective combined federal and state tax rates of in  in  and in the growth of the effective tax rate in is primarily due to the effect of nondeductible goodwill amortization 
the effective tax rates differ from combined estimated statutory rates of principally due to the effects of nontaxable interest income which is recognized for book  but not for tax purposes 
in addition  columbia s state income tax rate was reduced from to in as a result of surplus revenues received by the state of oregon

investments a year to year comparison shows that columbia s investment securities at december   totaled million  compared to million at december   and million at december  this represents an increase of between and and a decrease of between and increases or decreases in the investment portfolio are primarily a function of loan demand and changes in columbia s deposit structure 
on december   investments in federal funds sold an overnight investment were  and investments in restricted stock were million 
the balance of federal funds sold is influenced by cash demands  customer deposit levels  loan activity  and other investment transactions 
columbia follows a financial accounting principle which requires that investment securities be identified as held to maturity or available for sale 
held to maturity securities are those that columbia has the intent and ability to hold until they mature or are called 
available for sale securities are those that management may sell if liquidity requirements dictate or if alternative investment opportunities arise 
the mix of available for sale and held to maturity investment securities is determined by management  based on columbia s asset liability policy  management s assessment of the relative liquidity of columbia  and other factors 
at december   the investment portfolio  excluding restricted equity securities  consisted of available for sale securities and held to maturity securities 
at december   the portfolio consisted of available for sale securities and held to maturity securities 
at december   columbia s investment portfolio  excluding restricted equity securities  consisted of available for sale securities and held to maturity securities 
the present mix provides investment flexibility by placing more of the portfolio in the available for sale category 
at december   columbia s investment portfolio had total net unrealized losses of approximately million 
this compares to net unrealized gains of approximately  at december   and  at december  unrealized gains and losses reflect changes in market conditions and do not represent the amount of actual profits or losses columbia may ultimately realize 
actual realized gains and losses occur at the time investment securities are sold or redeemed 
federal funds sold are short term investments which mature on a daily basis 
columbia invests in these instruments to provide for additional earnings on excess available cash balances 
because of their short maturities  the balance of federal funds sold fluctuates dramatically on a day to day basis 
the balance on any one day is influenced by cash demands  customer deposit levels  loan activity and other investment transactions

loans columbia s loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing its lending operations 
generally  the guidelines address the types of loans that columbia seeks  target markets  underwriting and collateral requirements  terms  interest rate and yield considerations  and compliance with laws and regulations 
all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations 
these limitations apply to the borrower s total outstanding indebtedness to columbia  including the indebtedness of any guarantor 
the policies are reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors of columbia 
columbia supplements its own supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan audits by outside professionals experienced in loan review work 
bank officers are charged with loan origination in compliance with underwriting standards overseen by the loan administration department and in conformity with established loan policies 
on an annual basis  the board of directors determines the lending authority of the president  who then delegates lending authority to the chief lending officer and other lending officers 
such delegated authority may include authority related to loans  letters of credit  overdrafts  uncollected funds  and such other authority as determined by the board or the president within the president s delegated authority 
the president has authority to approve loans up to a lending limit set by the board of directors 
all loans above the lending limit of the president and up to a certain limit are reviewed for approval by an internal loan committee 
loans which exceed this limit but are less than pre established lending limits must be conditionally approved by an internal loan committee  and are subject to the approval of the board s loan committee up to pre established lending limits 
minutes from board loan committee meetings are reviewed by the full board at regularly scheduled monthly meetings 
all loans above the lending limit up to columbia s statutory loan to one borrower limitation also known as the legal lending limit require approval of the full board of directors

loans are charged against the reserve for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal or a portion thereof is unlikely 
the reserve is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans and prior loan loss experience 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay 
accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions  collection efforts and collateral position  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful

since  columbia s ratio of the reserve for loan losses to total loans has ranged from to 
the amounts provided by these ratios have been sufficient to fund columbia s charge offs  which have not been historically significant  and to provide for potential losses as the loan portfolio has grown 
these ratios have also been consistent with the level of nonperforming loans to total loans 
from december  through december   nonperforming loans to total loans have ranged from a low of to a high of 
this experience tracks with changes in the ratio of the reserve for loan losses to total loans and with the actual balances maintained in the reserve account 
finally  columbia s historical ratio of net charge offs recoveries to average outstanding loans illustrates its favorable loan charge off and recovery experience 
in two of the five years from to  annual loan recoveries have actually exceeded charge offs 
for the remaining three years between december  and  net charge offs ranged from to of average loans 
management believes columbia s loan underwriting policies and its loan officers knowledge of their customers are significant contributors to columbia s success in limiting loan losses 
during the year ended december   columbia recognized  in loan losses and  in recoveries 
charge offs recorded in were consistent with columbia s historical experience in view of the growth in its loan portfolio

further  columbia may place loans that are not contractually past due or that are deemed fully collateralized on nonaccrual status to promote better oversight and review of loan arrangements 
loans on nonaccrual status at december  totaled approximately  compared to million at december  and at the end of in  columbia adopted procedures to identify and monitor loans that have had their original terms restructured to accommodate borrowers financial needs 
loan revisions and modifications are commonly provided to meet the credit needs of borrowers in weakened financial condition and to enhance ultimate collection 
as of december   columbia identified loans totaling  that had been classified as restructured 
all of these loans are currently performing in accordance with their restructured terms 
however  management will continue to monitor these loans for any changes or deterioration in performance

the growth in deposit accounts in has primarily been in time deposits and noninterest bearing demand accounts 
noninterest bearing demand deposits  also called core deposits  continued to be a significant portion of columbia s deposit base 
to the extent columbia can fund operations with core deposits  net interest spread  which is the difference between interest income and interest expense  will improve 
at december   core deposits accounted for of total deposits  up from as of december  interest bearing deposits consist of money market  savings  and time certificate accounts 
interest bearing account balances tend to grow or decline as columbia adjusts its pricing and product strategies based on market conditions  including competing deposit products 
at december   total interest bearing deposit accounts were million  an increase of million  or  from december  increases in time deposits offset declines in interest bearing deposit and savings accounts 
interest bearing demand accounts decreased million  or  from december  to  after increasing million  or  from to overall growth in deposits has  in management s opinion  been helped by continued customer perceptions of declining service levels provided by super regional bank competitors 
columbia is not dependent on brokered deposits or high priced time deposits 
at december   time certificates of deposits in excess of  totaled million  or of total outstanding deposits  compared to million  or  of total outstanding deposits at december   and million  or  of total outstanding deposits at december  the following table sets forth  by time remaining to maturity  all time certificates of deposit accounts outstanding at december  in thousands three months or less  over three through six months  over six months through twelve months  over twelve months  short term borrowings the following table sets forth certain information with respect to columbia s federal home loan bank of seattle borrowings

dividends declared and paid were per share in  per share in  and per share in liquidity columbia has adopted policies to maintain a relatively liquid position to enable it to respond to changes in the financial environment and ensure sufficient funds are available to meet customers needs for borrowing and deposit withdrawals 
generally  columbia s major sources of liquidity are customer deposits  sales and maturities of investment securities  the use of federal funds markets  and net cash provided by operating activities 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments  which are influenced by general interest rate levels  interest rates available on other investments  competition  economic conditions  and other factors  are not 
liquid asset balances include cash  amounts due from other banks  federal funds sold  and securities available for sale and securities held to maturity with maturities in the next three months 
at december   these liquid assets totaled million or of total assets as compared to million or of total assets at december  another source of liquidity is the ability to borrow from the federal home loan bank of seattle and other correspondent banks 
the analysis of liquidity also includes a review of the changes that appear in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  the statement of cash flows includes operating  investing and financing categories 
operating activities include net income of million  which is adjusted for non cash items and increases or decreases in cash due to changes in certain assets and liabilities 
investing activities consist primarily of both proceeds from and purchases of securities  and the impact of the net growth in loans 
financing activities present the cash flows associated with deposit accounts  and reflect dividends paid to shareholders 
at december   columbia had outstanding commitments to make loans of million 
nearly all of these commitments represented unused portions of credit lines available to consumers under credit card and other arrangements and to businesses 
many of these credit lines will not be fully drawn upon and  accordingly  the aggregate commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
management believes that columbia s sources of liquidity are more than adequate to meet likely calls on outstanding commitments  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
capital the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation have established minimum requirements for capital adequacy for bank holding companies and member banks 
the requirements address both risk based capital and leveraged capital 
the regulatory agencies may establish higher minimum requirements if  for example  a corporation has previously received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk 
the following reflects columbia s various capital ratios at december   and december   as compared to regulatory minimums for capital adequacy purposes at december  at december  regulatory minimum tier capital total risk based capital leverage ratio item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and interest rate sensitivity columbia s results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income 
interest income and interest expense are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the marketplace 
columbia s interest and pricing strategies are driven by its asset liability management analysis and by local market conditions 
columbia seeks to manage its assets and liabilities to generate a stable level of earnings in response to changing interest rates and to manage its interest rate risk 
columbia further strives to serve its communities and customers through deployment of its resources on a corporate wide basis so that qualified loan demands may be funded wherever necessary in its branch banking system 
asset liability management involves managing the relationship between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
if assets and liabilities do not mature or reprice simultaneously  and in equal amounts  the potential for exposure to interest rate risk exists  and an interest rate gap is said to be present 
rising and falling interest rate environments can have various effects on a bank s net interest income  depending on the interest rate gap  the relative changes in interest rates that occur when assets and liabilities are repriced  unscheduled repayments of loans  early withdrawals of deposits  and other factors 
the following table sets forth the dollar amount of maturing interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  and the difference between them for the maturing or repricing periods indicated 
the amounts in the table are derived from columbia s internal data  which varies from amounts classified in its financial statements  and  although the information may be useful as a general measure of interest rate risk  the data could be significantly affected by external factors such as prepayments of loans or early withdrawals of deposits 
each of these may greatly influence the timing and extent of actual repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
december  variable less than one year rate one year or longer total dollars in thousands assets investments     loans     total assets     liabilities core deposits     jumbo cds    borrowings    total liabilities     net cumulative position    cumulative gap as a percent of assets the net cumulative gap position is somewhat negative since more liabilities than assets reprice during the next year 
this exposure to increasing rates is currently exaggerated by sticky deposit rates not expected to reprice rapidly in increasing rate environment 
however  columbia s asset rates change more than deposit rates  and management feels columbia s asset yields will change more than cost of funds when rates change 
management believes that columbia has relatively low interest rate risk that is somewhat asset sensitive 
the net interest margin should increase slightly when rates increase and shrink somewhat when rates fall 
this interest rate risk is driven by concentration of rate sensitive variable rate and short term commercial loans  one of columbia s major business lines 
columbia does have significant amounts of fixed rate loans to offset most of the impact from repricing of short term loans 
however  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates will not have a material adverse impact on columbia 
columbia s sensitivity to gains or losses in future earnings due to hypothetical decreases or increases in interest rates is as follows increase or financial impact decrease in on net interest rates interest margin
