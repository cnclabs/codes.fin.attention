year issue the year issue affected virtually all companies and organizations 
many companies had existing computer applications that used only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
some of these applications were designed and developed without considering the impact of the century change 
if not corrected  these computer applications were expected to fail or create erroneous results when processing data in the year in mid  the company initiated a project to address any potential disruptions related to data processing problems as a result of the year issue 
initially  the project focused primarily on the company s information technology it systems 
however  the project was subsequently expanded to include non it systems including transportation and warehouse refrigeration systems  telecommunications and utilities 
the project consisted of a number of phases awareness  assessment  programming testing and implementation 
in addition to the year project  the company standardized the computer systems at nine of its broadline distribution subsidiaries  which operate in a distributed computing environment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks are related to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
the company s primary interest rate risk is from changing interest rates related to the company s long term debt
