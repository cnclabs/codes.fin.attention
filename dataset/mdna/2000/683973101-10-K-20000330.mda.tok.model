overview optika is a leading provider of business to business electronic commerce solutions 
by leveraging the technology of the internet  our software bridges the gap between paper and electronic commerce across the enterprise and throughout supply chains 
the license of our software products is typically an executive level decision by prospective end users and generally requires us and our aps or oems to engage in a lengthy and complex sales cycle typically between six and twelve months from the initial contact date 
we distribute our products through a direct sales force and a network of aps and oems 
for  approximately of our license revenues were derived from our aps  approximately of our license revenues were derived from sales by oems and the remaining license fees were derived from direct sales 
however  no individual ap accounted for more than of our total revenues 
for the years ended december   and  we generated approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues from international sales 
our revenues consist primarily of license revenues  which are comprised of one time fees for the license of our products  service revenues  and maintenance revenues  which are comprised of fees for upgrades and technical support 
our aps and oems  which are responsible for the installation and integration of the software for their customers  enter into sales agreements with the end user  and purchase software directly from us 
we license software directly to the end user through software license agreements 
annual maintenance agreements are also entered into between the aps and oems and the end user  and the aps and oems then purchase maintenance services directly from us 
for and  approximately and  respectively of our total revenues were derived from software licenses and approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from maintenance agreements 
for and  other revenues  which are comprised of training  consulting and implementation services  and third party hardware and software products  accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenues 
we adopted the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  for transactions entered into after january  under sop  we will generally recognize license revenue upon shipment when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed or a purchase order has been received  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
where applicable  fees from multiple element arrangements are unbundled and recorded as revenue as the elements are delivered to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for the delivered and undelivered elements 
maintenance revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period  which is generally one year 
other revenues are recognized as services are performed 
we generally do not grant rights to return products  except for defects in the performance of the products relative to specifications and pursuant to standard industry shrink wrapped license agreements which provide for day rights of return if an end user does not accept the terms of the shrink wrapped license agreements 
our software license agreements generally do not provide price adjustments or rotation rights 
we generally include a day limited warranty with the software license  which entitles the end user to corrections for documented program errors 
based on our research and development process  costs incurred between the establishment of technological feasibility and general release of the software products are immaterial and therefore have not been capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred

cost of maintenance and other increased from million  or of maintenance and other revenues  for the year ended december   to million  or of maintenance and other revenues  for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of maintenance and other revenues is primarily a result of the leverage received from utilizing existing resources to service our increased maintenance base

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related expenses of administrative  executive and financial personnel  and outside professional fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to writing off or reserving asian accounts receivable during general and administrative expenses are expected to remain constant in restructuring charges and other non recurring charges 
due to the economic status and instability in the asian markets  we made the decision to shut down two of our four asian offices in the third quarter of  thus reducing future operational risks and cash outflows into the region 
this restructuring resulted in a  one time write off including  of goodwill   of severance costs and  of lease termination and other costs 
all actions relating to the restructuring plan were completed during and no restructuring accruals remain as all cash payments had been made as of december  other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest due to our investing activities offset by interest expense on our capitalized lease obligations  and other debt and foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction losses

benefit from income taxes 
we have recorded a partial valuation allowance against our carryforward tax benefits to the extent that we believe that it is more likely than not all of such benefits will not be realized in the near term 
our assessment of this valuation allowance was made using all available evidence  both positive and negative 
in particular we considered both our historical results and our projections of profitability for only reasonably foreseeable future periods 
our realization of the recorded net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income and therefore  we cannot assure you that such benefits will be realized

liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were million  decreasing approximately  from december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is primarily due to our net loss for the year and capital expenditures associated with computer equipment

cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash used of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used by investing activities consisted primarily of the purchase of short term securities 
cash provided from financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to cash provided from financing activities of  for the year ended december  cash provided from financing activities resulted primarily from proceeds of our issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises

we had no other debt outstanding at december  on february   pursuant to a securities purchase agreement  we completed the sale of an aggregate of  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock and warrant to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for the aggregate purchase price of million 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with anticipated cash flow from operations and our bank credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
thereafter  we may require additional funds to support such activity through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available at all or that if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive 
year we have experienced no significant year issues in either our own products or internal systems 
we are not aware of any year issues  now or in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted statement of position  software revenue recognition sop for transactions entered into beginning in on december  statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  was issued superseding sop and is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after march  sop has not had a material affect on our current business practices or recognition of revenues 
if our future business practices involve the granting of specified upgrade rights to future releases  extended payment terms  rights to additional products  subscription licensing arrangements or other provisions impacted by sop  as amended by sop and sop  the sop may have a material impact on the timing of our revenue recognition and could result in the deferral of significant amounts of revenues 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  sfas no 
as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards of derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of statements of financial accounting standards no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows as we do not currently hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  we had million in short term investments that are sensitive to market risks 
our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
we do not own any derivative financial instruments 
due to the nature of our investment portfolio we are primarily subject to interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio includes fixed rate debt instruments that are primarily united states government and agency bonds of duration ranging from one to five years 
the market value of these bonds is subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates decrease 
any material change in the interest rates would have a material change in the market value of our debt instruments 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from december  would cause the fair market value of these short term investments to change by an insignificant amount 
although the market value of these short term investments would change due to the interest rate fluctuation  we have the ability to hold the investments to maturity  which would reduce overall market risk
