item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview health card derives its revenue from the provision of comprehensive prescription benefit management services to sponsors of prescription benefit plans 
substantially all of the services health card provides to its sponsors are related to the adjudication of the drug claims at the point of service 
health card also recognizes administrative fees at the time of claims adjudication 
revenue is earned and recognized as follows administrative fees are agreed upon with the sponsor on either a per claim charge or a per plan participant per month charge 
per claim fees are billed to sponsors for the claims adjudicated during the period 
per plan participant per month fees are generally billed to sponsors at the beginning of the month 
the amount of revenue related to the drugs dispensed by pharmacies participating in health card s pharmacy network is recognized at the time of dispensing the drug  as the cost is incurred 
the following table sets forth the breakdown of health card s charges relating to pharmaceuticals dispensed and administrative fees years ended june  charges relating to pharmaceuticals    administrative fees and other    total revenues    health card does not take possession or legal ownership of the pharmaceutical drugs dispensed by the pharmacy network  although health card assumes the legal responsibility and financial risk of paying for dispensed pharmaceuticals whether or not health card is paid by its sponsors 
health card utilizes its comprehensive prescription benefit database to perform outcome studies and to develop disease information programs which are used to reduce overall healthcare costs 
health card also has access to an e pharmacy 
these programs currently produce a small amount of revenue 
health card believes that these value added information based services are becoming a more important component of managed care  and therefore these services should provide an increasing source of revenue for health card in the future 
cost of claims includes the amounts paid to network pharmacies  including mail service pharmacies  for pharmaceutical claims  and reductions resulting from rebates from drug manufacturers 
cost of claims are recognized as follows the contractual obligation of health card to pay for these drugs is recorded as cost of claims at the time of dispensing of the drug by the pharmacy network 
cost of claims is reduced by the rebates that health card retains net of amounts due to the sponsors and a fee retained by the rebate administrators as an administrative fee 
rebates are earned from drug manufacturers based on drugs utilized by plan participants at the time of dispensing 
health card s portion of these rebates  which varies by sponsor  is recorded monthly based upon the claims adjudicated in that month 
in the past health card relied upon third party administrators to negotiate contracts with drug manufacturers and submit health card s claims along with claims of others 
health card would receive estimates from the rebate administrator based on their analysis of the amount of rebates that health card s claims should generate 
these estimates were prepared by the rebate administrators based on estimates of how health card s claims might influence the market share of a particular drug covered under an agreement with a drug manufacturer 
market share is generally defined as the percentage of utilization of a certain drug or drugs within its therapeutic class 
historically  this market share has been very predictable and consistent with the prior quarter 
relying upon their analyses  the rebate administrators would then remit to health card of its estimate of the total amount to be collected days after the end of a quarter 
starting in april  health card began processing its rebate claims either direct with the drug manufacturers  through its wholly owned subsidiary  specialty  or through express 
for the claims made through december   express is obligated to pay health card a specified amount per claim 
subsequent to december   a new baseline will be established based on health card s actual claim history 
consequently  the total amount of rebates to be received from express will be known once the number of claims is known 
as to the agreements with the drug manufacturers  since health card now knows the criteria that relate to the amount of rebates from these manufacturers  health card computes the amount of rebates based on the actual claims data and the specified payment schedules 
the drug manufacturers  per the individual agreements  are obligated to reimburse health card for the earned rebates within a specified period of time 
health card  through specialty  has submitted the majority of covered claims to the drug manufacturers  in accordance with the agreements currently in place  for the quarter ended june  since this was health card s first submission direct to the drug manufacturers  and since approximately different contracts had to be analyzed and loaded into health card s custom designed rebate system  certain submissions were delayed and certain submissions still need to be made 
in addition  health card is attempting to negotiate agreements with several additional manufacturers and submit claims under such agreements with respect to the period 
these late submissions and submissions under any additional manufacturer agreements might have some negative short term effect on cash flow  but health card believes it has sufficient cash reserves to deal with any delayed reimbursements 
manufacturer rebates have historically had a significant impact on health card s financial performance as the following table shows years ended june  rebates as a of cost of claims of total gross profit of income before taxes due to the expected continued growth and diversification of health card s business  health card also expects rebates as a percentage of cost of claims  to increase and continue to account for a significant percentage of total gross profit and income before taxes 
certain of health card s sponsors are entitled to all or a portion of rebates received by health card  which portion varies by sponsor 
if such rebate programs were to be discontinued or adversely altered by drug manufacturers  or if the terms of health card s rebate sharing arrangements with its sponsors were adversely altered  it would have a material adverse effect on health card s business  operating results and financial condition 
due to changing market conditions and competition  it is possible that the percentage of rebates retained by health card based on its arrangements with the sponsors may change when these arrangements expire and may be lower in arrangements with new sponsors 
any such change in the percentage of rebates retained and recorded as a reduction of cost of claims could have a material adverse effect on health card s business  operating results and financial condition 
credit risk relating to the rebates receivable is evaluated based on the financial strength of the rebate administrator and the drug manufacturers 
health card believes that most of the drug manufacturers are fortune companies 
health card does not believe a credit risk reserve is necessary 
the prescription benefit management industry is intensely competitive  generally resulting in continuous pressure on health card s gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
in recent years  industry consolidation and dramatic growth in managed healthcare have led to increasingly aggressive pricing of prescription benefit management services 
given the pressure on all parties to reduce healthcare costs  health card expects this competitive environment to continue for the foreseeable future 
health card plans to continue its internal growth through increased marketing of its services and by expanding the range of services offered  particularly to include value added consulting and information based services which health card believes to be in growing demand within the healthcare industry 
in addition  health card intends to continue to pursue an acquisition program to supplement its internal growth by making acquisitions of other prescription benefit management service providers  similar to its recent pharmacy associates acquisition 
public offering on august   health card completed the sale of  shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering the public offering 
pursuant to the public offering  health card received net proceeds of approximately  concurrently  the bert e 
brodsky revocable trust the brodsky trust sold  shares of common stock of health card in an underwritten offering 
of the proceeds received by the brodsky trust  it used approximately  to repay to health card  in part  certain indebtedness owed by certain affiliates of the brodsky trust to health card 
see item hereof 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues increased million or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase related to revenues from new sponsors during the fiscal year was approximately million 
the majority of the remaining increase of approximately million was due to other existing sponsors as a result of several factors including higher charges relating to increased cost of pharmaceuticals  new drugs  plan participant growth  and an increase in the average number of claims per plan participant 
the remainder of the increase  approximately  was due to new services offered during the year around the e pharmacy and clinical services 
revenues grew year over year despite the loss of two key clients during the june  fiscal year 
one  a previous significant sponsor  terminated their contract with health card as of january  the second was placed in receivership by the state of florida as of january   and their members were dispersed to other plans not covered by health card 
these two sponsors accounted for million and million in revenues during the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the revenue from these two sponsors has been replaced by the million of revenue from new sponsors described above 
this helped to mitigate the overall impact of their loss on an annual run rate basis 
two other factors influencing the year to year comparison were revenues of the fiscal year ended june  included a one time rate increase of  from a major client  and the revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was net of an  reduction in revenue when health card settled certain fees due from a major sponsor as consideration for a new two year arrangement with this sponsor 
cost of claims increased million or approximately from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  as a percentage of revenues  cost of claims increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the primary reason for the cost of claims increasing as a percentage of revenue has to due with a risk sharing arrangement health card had with a major sponsor 
during the fiscal year ended june  the cost of drugs covered under this arrangement were greater than the agreed upon capitated rate  which led to a sharing of those costs between health card and the sponsor 
this fact along with the  revenue reduction mentioned above led to a differential between revenue and cost under this contract of million during fiscal this risk sharing arrangement is no longer in effect 
partially offsetting this increase in costs was a  increase in the amount of manufacturer rebates estimated to be received due to the increased volume of claims and the administrative fee to be paid to specialty 
see business services claims processing rebate administration rebates are treated as a reduction in the cost of claims 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended june  rebates payable were reduced by  when health card reevaluated its liability to a plan sponsor 
cost of claims for the fiscal year was decreased by the same amount 
gross profit increased million or approximately from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june   primarily as a result of the increase in revenues  offset by the increase in cost of claims 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which include amounts charged by affiliates  increased million  or approximately from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  million of the increase resulted from increases in compensation  benefits  rent  sales and marketing and other expenses related to the continued expansion of health card s business 
the majority of the compensation and benefits increase is related to approximately incremental employees at june  compared to june  depreciation and amortization expenses have also increased by approximately  as a function of increased hardware procurement and software development as health card continues to enhance its information technology capabilities 
health card also evaluated its receivables due from certain sponsors  including a key sponsor currently in receivership  as described above  and determined it should increase its reserves and or write off some balances 
the impact on health card was an incremental  in bad debt expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal this accounted for the majority of the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
while selling  general and administrative expenses increased year over year in an absolute amount they grew at a slower rate than the increase in revenue 
these expenses as a percentage of revenue actually declined from in fiscal year to in fiscal year general and administrative expenses charged by affiliates increased  or approximately  from  for the fiscal year ended june  to  for the fiscal year ended june   primarily as a result of increased information technology services and rent to support the business 
other income increased  from  for the fiscal year ended june  to  for the fiscal year ended june  the net increase to income was due to an increase in interest income of  earned on increased cash from the public offering and a  decrease in offering costs 
this addition to income was partially offset by a  increase in interest expense from a capital lease for computer hardware 
the provision for income taxes increased  from  for the fiscal year ended june  to  for the fiscal year ended june  the provision for the fiscal year ended june  was reduced by the utilization of a  net operating loss carryforward 
there is no remaining net operating loss carry forward to the year ended june  fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase resulted primarily from a million increase in fees related to the increase in the number of plan participants under an arrangement with one of health card s major sponsors and includes approximately  in additional revenue recorded in september when the amount of the adjustment became determinable  upon health card receiving verbal acceptance of the calculation under the provisions of the arrangement to adjust for the increased cost of drugs primarily related to the prior year 
claims under the plan of another major sponsor increased by  claims which resulted in an increase in revenues of approximately million 
the remaining increase of approximately million was due primarily to other existing sponsors as a result of higher charges relating to pharmaceuticals  new drugs  plan participant growth and an increase in the average number of claims per plan participant 
new business  as a percentage of revenue growth  increased throughout the fiscal year ended june  cost of claims increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  as a percentage of revenues  cost of claims remained unchanged at approximately 
gross profit increased million  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june   primarily as a result of the increase in revenues  offset by the increase in the cost of claims 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which include amounts charged by affiliates  increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase resulted primarily from an increase of  representing additional reserves against certain receivables 
health card evaluated its accounts receivable as of june  taking into consideration the expiration of certain contracts during the period and the status of negotiations to renew those contracts 
as consideration for the renewal of these contracts  health card determined that it would be necessary to negotiate the receivable balance due from these contracts and that health card most likely would not be able to collect the full amount 
as a result  health card estimated and recorded a reserve for the amount that may not be collectible 
in prior periods  due to the status of these contracts  these additional reserves were not required based upon health card s analysis 
the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from an increase of  in the bad debt reserve  a  bonus to certain officers stockholders  a  compensation accrual to an officer stockholder and a million increase in compensation  benefits  sales and marketing and other expenses related to the expansion of health card s business 
general and administrative expenses charged by affiliates decreased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease of million due to compensation of employees hired by health card who were previously engaged through an affiliated service vendor and a decrease of  for software maintenance  offset by increases of  for equipment rental   for data processing related charges and  for other operating expenses 
other income increased  from a net expense of  for the fiscal year ended june  to income of  for the fiscal year ended june   due to a  increase in interest accrued on a loan due from an affiliate  a  increase in interest earned on short term investments of excess cash balances and a  decrease in public offering costs 
the provision for income taxes increased  from  for the fiscal year ended june  to  for the fiscal year ended june   as a result of increased taxable income after utilization of a net operating loss carryforward in the amount of approximately  liquidity and capital resources as of june   health card had working capital of million 
this represented an million improvement in working capital over the million working capital deficiency as of june  million of the improvement was due to increased current assets million in fiscal vs 
million in fiscal cash and cash equivalents balances accounted for this increase as these balances were up million at the end of fiscal over the balance at the end of june  concurrently  current liabilities were approximately  lower at the end of fiscal than at the end of fiscal this was primarily due to lower amounts due for current income taxes and lower amounts due to affiliates and officers 
health card has generated positive net cash provided by operating activities in each of the last three fiscal years million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
the million improvement in net cash from operating activities for the fiscal year ended june  over the fiscal year ended june  stemmed primarily from the following i improved collections of accounts receivables million positive impact  ii reduced rebate receivables million positive impact  and iii offset by reductions in accounts payables and accrued expenses million negative impact 
the accounts receivables balances remained virtually the same from fiscal year to fiscal year while revenues were increasing 
while there was a write down of  of old rebate receivables from a rebate administrator that health card no longer utilizes  there were amounts received for older balances that were outstanding at the beginning of fiscal year the improved cash flow from operations along with the cash from the public offering described below enabled health card to make payments so as to get more current with its vendors 
in contrast  for the fiscal year  the majority of net cash provided by operating activities  besides from net income  was due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by increasing accounts receivable balances 
historically  the timing of health card s accounts receivable and accounts payable has generally been a net source of cash from operating activities 
this is the result of the terms of trade in place with plan sponsors on the one hand  and health card s pharmacy network on the other hand 
these terms generally lead to health card s payments to participating pharmacies being slower than its corresponding collections from plan sponsors 
health card believes that this situation is not unusual in the prescription benefit management industry and expects to operate on similar terms for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that such terms of trade will continue in the future and  if they were to change materially  health card could require additional working capital financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing could be obtained at rates or on terms acceptable to health card  if at all 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to approximately  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
these uses of cash resulted primarily from capital expenditures  and advances and payments of amounts due to from stockholders 
in february  health card entered into two capital lease transactions with a computer manufacturer for hardware and software procured from the manufacturer 
the purchase price of these capital assets was  the hardware lease is for a term of months with monthly payments of  the software lease is for a term of months with monthly payments of  net cash used in provided by financing activities amounted to approximately million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
these uses of cash resulted primarily from capital distributions and repayment of debt 
the cash provided by financing activities for fiscal resulted primarily from  shares of common stock purchased for million by the principal stockholder 
at the beginning of fiscal year  pursuant to health card s public offering described below  million of net cash was generated during the fiscal year ended june  health card used approximately  of these funds during the fiscal year ended june  to purchase some of its stock back into the treasury 
in february  health card entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party for computer software products and professional services 
the agreement required health card to pay an initial license fee 
in addition  if certain milestones are met  based on the number of processed claims  as defined  the initial license fee increases incrementally as specified 
to date one milestone has been met 
the agreement also provides for the monthly payment of a fee for maintenance and updating services aggregating annually to of the initial license fee  as defined 
it is anticipated that based on internal growth and the pharmacy associates acquisition that at least one milestone  and perhaps two  will be met during calendar year the financial impact to health card can be between  and  the registration statement for health card s public offering became effective on july  the public offering 
health card consummated the public offering on august  and issued  shares of common stock at an offering price of per share 
health card granted the underwriters of the public offering  warrants for nominal consideration 
the warrants entitle the underwriters to purchase  shares of common stock from health card at per share 
the warrants are exercisable for four years commencing on july  in addition  the underwriters were granted an overallotment option by health card to buy  shares of common stock at per share exercisable by september  the underwriters did not exercise this option 
concurrent with the public offering  the selling stockholder sold  shares of common stock from his holdings at per share 
health card received gross proceeds of  representing payment for the sale of the  shares plus of the proceeds from the sale of the  shares by the selling stockholder for repayment of  of indebtedness owed by the selling stockholder and affiliates to health card 
such proceeds were reduced by underwriting discounts and commissions  a non accountable expense allowance and a financial advisory fee paid to the underwriters plus certain fees and expenses paid by health card 
on july  health card acquired pharmacy associates for million cash plus  shares of its common stock 
the cash purchase price represented a partial use of the proceeds of the public offering 
it is anticipated that based on current operations  pharmacy associates should generate enough net cash to fund its own operations 
see  business general 
health card anticipates that the remaining net proceeds of the public offering and the repayment of certain affiliate and shareholder debt  together with anticipated cash flow from operations from both health card and pharmacy associates  will be sufficient to satisfy health card s contemplated cash requirements for at least months 
this is based upon current levels of capital expenditures and anticipated operating results for the next months 
however  it is one of health card s stated goals to acquire other prescription benefit management companies 
this will require cash 
depending on health card s evaluation of future acquisitions  additional cash may be required 
therefore  revolving credit lines for acquisitions and or operations and debt financing are being evaluated as backups to anticipated cash needs 
in the event that health card s plans change or its assumptions prove to be inaccurate or the proceeds of the public offering otherwise prove to be insufficient to fund operations and acquisitions  health card could be required to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
other matters inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on health card s net income 
recent pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities income sfas no 
 which requires the recording of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
among other disclosures  sfas no 
requires that all derivatives be recognized and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding the derivative 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for years beginning after june  health card has no derivative investments and does not participate in hedging activities  therefore  its financial position  results of operations and disclosures will be unaffected by the adoption of this standard 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
health card is currently assessing the impact of sab on its consolidated financial statements  and believes that the effect  if any  will not be material to health card s operating results
