the lease portfolio increased by percent in  to million 
the lease portfolio has traditionally consisted of leases on vehicles for consumers and small businesses 
competition for automobile financing has increased in recent years  resulting in a decline in the consumer leasing portfolio

based upon consideration of the above factors  management believes that the allowance for loan lease losses is adequate to provide for the risk of loss inherent in the current loan and lease portfolio 
management uses a model to measure some of these factors and the resulting quantitative analysis  combined with qualitative assessments  comprise the basis on which the adequacy of the reserve for loan lease losses is determined 
the reserve for loan lease losses increased by million from to the increase included million attributable to the mahopac national bank acquisition  and a  increase as a result of the provision for loan lease losses exceeding the net loan losses for the year

deposit growth consisted primarily of core deposits  which increased by million  while time deposits of  or more grew by million 
the strength of the mahopac national bank s core deposit base was an important consideration in management s decision to acquire the mahopac national bank

the weighted average interest rate on borrowings due in more than one year carried an average interest rate of percent at december  liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of adequate funding sources to satisfy the demand for credit  deposit withdrawals  and business investment opportunities 
the company s large  stable core deposit base and strong capital position are the foundation for the company s liquidity position 
asset and liability positions are monitored primarily through asset liability management committees of the subsidiary banks  which review monthly reports on the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity positions

the decline in this ratio is partially attributable to an increase in mortgage backed securities  which have stated maturities in excess of one year  but have monthly principal reductions 
total mortgage backed securities increased from million at year end  to million at year end cash flow from the loan and investment portfolios provides a significant source of liquidity 
investment in residential mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities  and consumer loans totaled approximately million at december  aggregate amortization from monthly payments on these assets provides significant cash flow to the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk the company s primary market risk exposure relates to sensitivity to interest rate changes 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the volatility in earnings  resulting from changes in interest rates 
each month the asset liability management committees estimate the earnings impact of changes in interest rates 
the findings of the committees are incorporated into investment and funding decisions  and in the business planning process 
table is a condensed static gap report  which illustrates the anticipated repricing intervals of assets and liabilities as of december  the analysis reflects a liability sensitive position  suggesting that earnings would benefit from a declining interest rate environment and would be hindered by a rising rate environment

based upon the simulation analysis performed as of december   a basis point upward shift in interest rates over a one year time frame would result in a one year decline of approximately percent in net interest income  assuming management takes no action to address balance sheet mismatches 
the same simulation indicates that a basis point decline in interest rates over a one year period would increase net interest income by approximately percent 
the simulation model is useful in identifying potential exposure to interest rate movements  however  management feels that certain actions could be taken to offset some of the negative effects of unfavorable movements in interest rates 
although the analysis reflects some exposure to rising interest rates  management feels the exposure is not significant in relation to the earnings and capital strength of the company
