item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview outpost 
com is a leading global internet only retailer featuring over  consumer technology and related products for the home and office 
with over  customers world wide  we offer an online superstore at www 
outpost 
com that provides one stop shopping for domestic and international customers  hours a day  seven days a week 
our superstore features computer hardware  software  electronics and accessories 
although we have grown rapidly since our inception in  we continue to incur significant net losses 
we believe that in order to continue our growth and expansion  operating expenses will increase as a result of the financial commitments required to further develop multiple marketing channels and enhance our web site s features and functionality 
as such  we expect to continue to incur losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for the near term 
since computer retailers typically have low product gross margins  our ability to achieve profitability is dependent upon our ability to substantially increase net sales and to broaden our range of product offerings to include higher margin products 
to the extent that our marketing efforts do not result in significantly higher net sales  we will be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that sufficient revenues will be generated from the sale of our products to enable us to reach or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
although we have experienced significant revenue growth since inception  such growth rates may not be sustainable in the future 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results  including our gross profit and operating expenses as percentage of net sales  are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to represent a portion of our overall revenue 
our international sales are denominated in us dollars and  therefore  those sales are not affected by foreign currency translation 
however  foreign currency fluctuations may affect demand for our products 
in addition  international sales are subject to diverse market factors such as the economic conditions of a given country or region 
we believe that the key factor affecting our long term financial success is our ability to attract and retain customers in a cost effective manner 
currently  we seek to expand our customer base and encourage repeat buying through multiple sales and marketing programs 
such programs include i brand development  ii online and offline marketing and promotional campaigns  iii linking programs with targeted web sites  iv personalized direct marketing programs designed to generate repeat sales from existing customers and v alliances with internet content providers and portal sites 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in our future operating results due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that may affect our operating results include the frequency of new product releases  success of business alliances  mix of product sales and seasonality of sales typically experienced by retailers 
sales in the computer retail industry are significantly affected by the release of new products 
infrequent or delayed new product releases  when they occur  negatively impact the overall growth in computer retail sales 
gross profit margins for hardware  software and accessories vary widely  with computer hardware generally having the lowest gross profit margins 
while we have some ability to affect our product mix through effective upselling and cross selling of high margin products  our sales mix will vary from period to period and our gross margins will fluctuate accordingly
