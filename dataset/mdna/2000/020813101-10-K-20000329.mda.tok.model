the million revolving credit facility rcf was used to fund the principal portion of the purchase price 
at the end of march  the company repaid approximately million of borrowings under the rcf with the proceeds from the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes 
such repayment created the capacity under the rcf to incur the borrowings used to finance the acquisition of cox

rate increase due to non deductible goodwill resulting from the cox acquisition offset partially by higher tax credits and lower statutory tax rates on foreign earnings 
management actions in  the company announced the decision to close or sell its leased aquatic animal health plant in bellevue  washington and terminate all employees 
all significant production is being transferred to the aahd production facility in norway and therefore aahd revenues are not expected to be significantly affected 
at year end the washington plant had ceased production and the fixed assets have been written down to their net realizable value 
the result of the writedown of leasehold improvements and certain machinery and equipment and the severance of all employees is a total charge of approximately million in while no specific actions are planned  the company believes the dynamic nature of its business may present additional opportunities to rationalize personnel functions and operations to increase efficiency and profitability 
accordingly  similar management actions may be considered in the future and could be material to the results of operations in the quarter they are announced 
inflation the effect of inflation on the company s operations during  and was not significant 
liquidity and capital resources at december   stockholders equity was million compared to million and million at december   and  respectively 
the ratio of long term debt to equity was   and at december   and  respectively

the acquisition program increased the following balance sheet captions accounts receivable million  inventory million  property plant and equipment million  intangible assets million and accounts payable million 
balance sheet captions decreased as of december  compared to december in us dollars as the functional currencies of the company s principal foreign subsidiaries  the norwegian krone  danish krone and british pound  depreciated versus the us dollar in by approximately  and  respectively 
these decreases in balance sheet captions impact to some degree the above mentioned ratios 
the approximate decrease due to currency translation of selected captions was accounts receivable million  inventories million  accounts payable and accrued expenses million  and total stockholder s equity million 
the million decrease in stockholder s equity represents other comprehensive loss for the year and results from the strengthening of the us dollar in against all major functional currencies of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
the cox acquisition in substantially increased the following balance sheet captions compared to accounts receivable million  inventory million  property  plant and equipment million  intangible assets million  and accounts payable and accrued expenses million 
the company presently has various capital expenditure programs under way and planned including the expansion of the fcd facility in budapest  hungary  and the ipd facility in the uk 
in  the company s capital expenditures were million  and in the company plans to spend a greater amount than in in february  the company s uspd entered into an agreement with ascent pediatrics  inc ascent under which uspd may provide up to million in loans to ascent to be evidenced by convertible subordinated notes due up to million of the proceeds of the loans can be used only for general corporate purposes  with million of proceeds reserved for approved projects and acquisitions intended to enhance the growth of ascent 
all potential loans are subject to ascent meeting a number of terms and conditions at the time of each loan 
the exact timing and or ultimate amount of loans to be provided cannot be predicted 
as of february  million has been advanced for general corporate purposes 
ascent has incurred operating losses since its inception 
an important element of ascent s business plan contemplated commercial introduction of two pediatric pharmaceutical products which require fda approval 
ascent has received fda approval in january for one product and the other product is subject to fda action which has delayed its commercial introduction until mid or later 
the delay in drug introduction resulted in ascent forecasting that its accumulated losses would exceed the combined sum of its stockholders equity and indebtedness subordinate to the company s loans during the first half of in response to this forecast  the company and ascent have negotiated amendments to the original agreements providing for a a change in the option period from to  b a change in the formula period for determining the price of the company s purchase option from to  c the granting of a security interest to the company in the products or businesses purchased by ascent with funds loaned by alpharma and d the commitment of a major shareholder of ascent to provide up to million of additional financing to ascent in addition to the million previously committed subordinate to the company s loan 
the company is required to recognize losses  up to the amount of its loans  to the extent ascent has accumulated losses in excess of its stockholders equity and the indebtedness subordinate to the company s loans 
the company is further required to assess the general collectibility of its loans to ascent and make any appropriate reserves 
the additional financing results in ascent continuing to have positive stockholders equity and subordinated indebtedness assuming current operating forecasts are met 
in september  the company acquired a technology license and option agreement for the southern cross animal health product  reporcin 
the agreement requires the leasing or construction of additional production capacity and additional payments as additional regulatory approvals for the product are obtained in other markets 
total additional payments of approximately million are required over the next years approximately million of which is expected over the next years if all possible country approvals are received 
at december   the company had million in cash  short term lines of credit of million and approximately million available under its million credit facility credit facility 
the credit facility has several financial covenants  including an interest coverage ratio  total debt to ebitda ratio  and equity to total asset ratio 
interest on borrowings under the facility is at libor plus a margin of between 
and depending on the ratio of total debt to ebitda 
the company believes that the combination of cash from operations and funds available under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to cover its currently planned operating needs and firm commitments in a substantial portion of the company s short term and long term debt is at variable interest rates 
during  the company will consider entering into interest rate agreements to fix interest rates for all or a portion of its variable debt to minimize the impact of future changes in interest rates 
the company s policy is to selectively enter into plain vanilla agreements to fix interest rates for existing debt if it is deemed prudent 
an important element of the company s long term strategy is to pursue acquisitions that in general will broaden global reach and or augment product portfolios 
in this regard the company is currently evaluating and  in some instances actively considering several possible acquisition candidates 
subsequent to december  the company executed a non binding letter of intent with respect to one such business 
filings were made and clearance received under the hart scott rodino anti trust improvements act and the company is currently negotiating definitive agreements and reviewing certain data  including recently received financial information 
if consummated  this acquisition would be material to the operations and financial position of the company and would require funding in addition to that presently available under the company s banking arrangements 
such funding may include bridge financing  high yield notes  an expansion of current lines of credit and a sale of additional equity 
depending on the ultimate financing vehicle chosen the credit facility may be restructured or expanded and the consent of the lenders thereunder may be required 
there can be no assurance that any transaction will be completed 
year the company completed its program to address its potential yk issues prior to december  and experienced no disruption of operations from yk related problems on january  or during the first months of the new year 
the costs directly associated with the company s yk remediation efforts totaled approximately million 
although all systems and equipment are yk compliant and no disruptions to alpharma s operations have been experienced to date  the company will continue to monitor its internal systems and equipment and third party relationships for any yk related problems that might develop 
we do not expect any problems to develop that would have a material effect on the company s operations or results 
derivative financial instruments market risk and risk management policies the company s earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s risk management practice includes the selective use  on a limited basis  of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate agreements 
such instruments are used for purposes other than trading 
foreign currency exchange rate movements create fluctuations in us dollar reported amounts of foreign subsidiaries whose local currencies are their respective functional currencies 
the company has not used foreign currency derivative instruments to manage translation fluctuations 
the company and its respective subsidiaries primarily use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain cash flows denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary s functional currency 
such cash flows are normally represented by actual receivables and payables and anticipated receivables and payables for which there is a firm commitment 
at december  the company had forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of million 
the fair market value of such contracts is essentially the same as the notional amount 
all contracts expire in the first three quarters of the cash flows expected from the contracts will generally offset the cash flows of related non functional currency transactions 
the change in value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulting from a movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million and generally would be offset by the change in value of the hedged receivable or payable 
at december  the company has no interest rate agreements outstanding 
the company is considering entering into interest rate agreements in to fix the interest rate on a portion of its long term debt 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  january  for the company 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements which summarizes some of the staff s interpretations of the application of generally accepted accounting standards to revenue recognition 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  of sab on its results of operations
