background and overview the university is a regional proprietary institution of higher education offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs at thirteen campuses in maryland  virginia  and the district of columbia 
the company was incorporated in may to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of the university and elp from mr 
and mrs 
ron k 
bailey  the previous sole stockholders of the university 
upon completion of the company s initial public offering in july  the university and elp  which administers the sel program  became direct subsidiaries of the company 
revenues  operating income  and net income have increased in each of the last three years 
from through  revenues increased approximately  operating income increased approximately  and net income pro forma increased 
over the three year period  tuition revenue accounted for approximately of total revenue 
the number of students increased approximately from  at the beginning of the fall quarter to  at the beginning of the fall quarter  and tuition rates increased approximately over the last three years 
the university s principal source of revenue is tuition collected from its students 
the academic year of the university is divided into four quarters  which approximately coincide with the four quarters of the calendar year 
students generally must pay the entire tuition for each course prior to the beginning of the quarter 
if a student withdraws from a course prior to completion  the university refunds a portion of the tuition 
when students register for courses  tuition is recorded as unearned tuition  which is recognized as courses are taught through the academic quarter 
revenues also consist in part of fees and other revenues derived principally from application fees  no show fees  and bookstore sales 
when a student registers for a course but does not attend any classes  the university may have no place in the course for another student and therefore imposes a no show fee on the registered student 
beginning in  the company contracted out its bookstore operations to a third party 
unless otherwise indicated  student enrollment information presented herein reflects enrollment as of the beginning of the fall academic quarter for the applicable year  which is the beginning of the academic year and the industry practice for measuring enrollments at educational institutions 
the university records tuition receivable when students register for the academic quarter  generally prior to the end of the previous academic quarter 
because the university s academic quarters coincide with the calendar quarters  tuition receivable at the end of any calendar quarter largely represents student tuition due for the following academic quarter 
based upon past experience and judgment  the university establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to accounts receivable not included in unearned tuition 
any uncollected account more than six months past due is charged against the allowance 
the university s historical bad debt expense related to tuition receivable as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively

in  enrollments at the beginning of the winter  spring  summer and fall academic quarters were    and  respectively 
costs generally are not affected by the seasonal factors and do not vary significantly on a quarterly basis 
to some extent  however  instructional and educational support expenses are lower in the third quarter because fewer part time faculty are needed

the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash generated from operating activities and  if necessary  cash borrowed under the credit facility  will be sufficient to meet the company s requirements for at least the next months 
if the university decides to purchase additional campus facilities  it may finance such acquisitions with indebtedness 
impact of the year the year issue concerns the potential exposures related to the automated generation of business and financial misinformation resulting from the application of computer programs that have been written using six digits eg   rather than eight eg   to define the applicable year of business 
this date definition limitation could  unless corrected  cause some computer programs  hardware and non information technology systems to be unable to process information containing dates after december  as a result of the successful implementation and employment of the company s year readiness plan  the company has experienced no disruption as a result of the year changeover 
the company is committed to continuous monitoring of all systems  applications and operating systems 
updates for applications and operating systems will be obtained as required 
the company s costs to date for its year compliance project  excluding the salaries of its employees  have not been material 
in fact  the company s it systems have been modified by the suppliers of those systems and such modifications were included as part of normal upgrades of those systems 
the company does not currently believe that there are any outstanding year issues related to its it systems  the it systems of any vendor  or the it systems of the department of education 
there can be no guarantee  however  that internal systems  external systems  non it systems  and the systems of the company s major suppliers will operate without failure as a result of residual year issues 
the company cannot assure that undetected internal and external year issues will not materially impact its business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s historical operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of its investments 
the company invests its excess cash in marketable securities and certificates of deposit 
at december  the company s investments include certificates of deposit  money market funds  us government obligations primarily fixed income securities and high quality equity securities 
the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in the market risk of its marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale as of december  the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
these securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
investments in certificates of deposit and money market funds may adversely impact future earnings due to a decrease in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   a increase or decline in interest rates will not have a material impact on the company s future earnings  fair values  or cash flows related to investments in certificates of deposit or interest earning marketable securities 
in addition  as of december   a decrease in market values would not have a material impact on the company s future earning  fair values  financial position or cash flows related to investments in marketable equity securities
