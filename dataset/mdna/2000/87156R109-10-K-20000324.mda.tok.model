item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview synaptic pharmaceutical corporation synaptic or the company is a biotechnology company engaged in the development of a broad platform of enabling technology which it calls human receptor targeted drug design technology 
the company is utilizing this technology in its genomics program to discover and clone the genes that code for human receptors 
the company and its licensees are also utilizing this technology in functional genomics programs to discover the function of these receptors in the body and thus specific physiological disorders with which they may be associated 
the company and its licensees are in turn utilizing the cloned receptor genes to design compounds that can potentially be developed as drugs for treating these disorders 
the company is currently collaborating with grunenthal gmbh grunenthal 
concurrently with the establishment of this collaborative arrangement  the company granted a license to certain of its technology and patent rights to grunenthal 
in addition to its ongoing collaborative arrangement  three other pharmaceutical companies  eli lilly and company lilly  novartis pharma ag novartis  and glaxo group limited glaxo  have licenses to certain of the company s technology and patent rights 
the lilly and novartis licenses were granted concurrently with the establishment of collaborative arrangements with such companies 
while the lilly collaboration and the novartis collaboration ended in july and august  respectively  the associated licenses continue for the respective periods provided in these agreements 
for convenience of reference  the agreements pursuant to which the licenses referred to in this paragraph and the preceding paragraph were granted are collectively referred to in this item as the license agreements 
since inception  the company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of its stock  through contract and license revenue under certain of its license agreements  and through interest income and capital gains resulting from its investments 
the company also has received revenues from government grants under the small business innovative research sbir program of the national institutes of health 
under the license agreements  the company may receive one or more of the following types of revenue contract revenue  license revenue  royalty revenue or revenue from the sales of drugs 
contract revenue includes research funding to support a specified number of the company s scientists and payments upon the achievement of specified research and development milestones 
research funding revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the collaboration to which it relates and is based upon predetermined funding requirements 
research and development milestone payment revenue is recognized when the related research or development milestone is achieved 
license revenue represents non refundable payments for a license to one or more of the company s patents and or a license to the company s technology 
non refundable payments for licenses were recognized as they were received or when they became guaranteed 
under each of the license agreements other than the grunenthal agreement  the company is entitled to receive royalty payments based upon the sales of drugs that may be developed using the company s technology or that may be covered by the company s patents 
under the grunenthal agreement  the company has development and marketing rights in certain territories with respect to drugs  if any  that are jointly identified as part of the collaboration with grunenthal 
accordingly  the company may receive revenue from sales in its territories as defined of such drugs if it markets them independently or the company may receive royalty payments if it licenses its marketing rights to a third party 
to date  the company has not received either royalty revenue or revenue from the sales of drugs and the company does not expect to receive such revenues for a number of years  if at all 
to date  the company s expenditures have been for research and development related expenses  general and administrative related expenses  fixed asset purchases and various patent related expenditures incurred in protecting the company s technologies 
the company has been historically unprofitable and had an accumulated deficit of  at december  the company expects to continue to incur operating losses for a number of years and may not become profitable  unless and until it receives royalty revenue or revenue from sales of drugs that may be developed with the use of its technology or its patent rights 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december   and revenues 
the company recognized revenue of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the decrease of  from to was attributable primarily to the following a net decrease in contract revenue of  resulting from the contractual termination of three of the company s collaborative arrangements and the receipt in of  of non recurring license revenue under the glaxo agreement 
the decrease of  from to was attributable primarily to the following a net decrease in contract revenue of  resulting primarily from the contractual termination of the novartis agreements on august  as well as the reduction in full time equivalent scientists being funded under another of the license agreements and a decrease in grant revenue of  which were offset by the receipt in of  of non recurring license revenue under the glaxo agreement 
research and development expenses 
the company incurred research and development expenses of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the decrease of  or  from to was attributable primarily to a reduction in compensation and fringe benefit expenses due to a net decrease in headcount as well as corresponding reductions in travel and supply costs  all of which were partially offset by increased rent expense for facilities resulting from previously contracted increases in square footage 
the increase of  or  from to was attributable primarily to increases in compensation and fringe benefit expenses  facility related costs  and research supply costs 
general and administrative expenses 
the company incurred general and administrative expenses of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the increase of  or  from to was attributable primarily to increases in rent expense resulting from previously contracted increases in square footage  and compensation and fringe benefit expenses 
the increase of  or  from to was attributable primarily to an increase in compensation and fringe benefit expenses 
other income  net 
the company recorded other income of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the decrease of  from to in other income was primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances during the increase of  from to in other income was primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances during which resulted from the receipt of net proceeds from a public offering of its common stock completed in november net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share 
the net loss incurred by the company was  per share   per share and  per share for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the increase in net loss per share of from to resulted primarily from the recognition of lower total revenue and of higher total expenses 
the decrease in net loss per share of from to resulted primarily from higher average outstanding shares during partially offset by the recognition of higher total expenses 
the increase in average outstanding shares primarily relates to the sale of  shares of common stock in a public offering in the fourth quarter of as well as the sale of  shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock warrants in january operating trends 
revenues may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors including the timing of revenue earned under the license agreements and revenue that may be earned under future collaborative and or license agreements 
on january   the company entered into a research and licensing agreement with kissei pharmaceutical co  ltd 
the company will recognize revenue under this agreement during and expects to recognize revenue under this agreement during and under the terms of certain of the license agreements  revenues may be recognized if certain milestones are achieved 
management continues to assess the opportunity for obtaining additional funding under new collaborative and or license agreements as well as obtaining financing through equity transactions 
the company continues to monitor its spending level in order to insure that it has enough cash to last through the year other income  net is expected to decline in and as existing funds are utilized to fund the company s operations 
property and equipment spending may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors including the number of collaborations in which the company is involved at any given time  replacement due to obsolescence and replacement due to normal wear 
consequently  equipment spending in is expected to increase from that of at december   the company held marketable securities with an estimated fair value of  the company s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short term interest rates 
the company does not purchase financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
all of the marketable securities held by the company are classified as available for sale securities 
the following table provides information about marketable securities held by the company at december  estimated principal amount and weighted average stated rate fair by expected maturity value s total s principal       weighted average stated rates the stated rates of interest expressed in the above table may not approximate the actual yield of the securities which the company currently holds since the company has purchased some of its marketable securities at other than face value 
additionally  some of the securities represented in the above table may be called or redeemed  at the option of the issuer  prior to their expected due dates 
if such early redemptions occur  the company may reinvest the proceeds realized on such calls or redemptions in marketable securities with stated rates of interest or yields that are lower than those of current holdings  affecting both future cash interest streams and future earnings 
in addition to investments in marketable securities  the company places some of its cash in money market funds in order to keep cash available to fund operations and to hold cash pending investments in marketable securities 
fluctuations in short term interest rates will affect the yield on monies invested in such money market funds 
such fluctuations can have an impact on future cash interest streams and future earnings of the company  but the impact of such fluctuations are not expected to be material 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations 
management believes that it has remedied all of its information technology and non information technology systems that may have been affected by the year issue 
the company did not experience any problems or issues arising from the date change from to through  the company spent less than  to remedy systems that may have been affected by the year issue and does not expect any future expenses 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregated  and  respectively 
this decrease was a result of the utilization of these resources to fund the company s operations 
to date  the company has met its cash requirements through the sale of its stock  through contract and license revenue  through sbir grants and through interest income and gains resulting from its investments 
if the current biotechnology financing environment remains unfavorable  raising additional capital may be difficult 
at december   the company had invested an aggregate of  in property and equipment 
the company leases laboratory and office facilities under an agreement expiring on december  the minimum annual payment under the lease is currently  the lease provides for fixed escalations in rent payments in the years and at december   the company had  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the company currently intends to utilize these funds primarily to conduct certain of its research programs  for patent related expenditures  for general corporate purposes  to make leasehold improvements to its facilities and to purchase property and equipment 
the company expects to continue to incur operating losses for a number of years 
the company believes that its cash on hand and cash that it expects to receive through interest payments on its investments  will be sufficient to fund its operations  as well as the company s share of certain development costs under the grunenthal agreement  through the year as of december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  for federal income tax purposes that will expire principally in the years through in addition  the company had research and development credit carryforwards of  which will expire principally in through for financial reporting purposes  a valuation allowance has been recognized to offset the deferred tax assets related to these carryforwards 
due to limitations imposed by the tax reform act of  and as a result of a significant change in the company s ownership in and  the utilization of  of net operating loss carryforwards is subject to annual limitation 
the utilization of the research and development credits is similarly limited

such cautionary statements qualify the forward looking statements included in this report 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements 
early stage of product development  technological uncertainty since its inception in january  the company has focused its activities on the discovery and cloning of receptor genes and the use of such genes as tools in the design of precisely targeted compounds for a broad range of therapeutic applications 
to date  neither the company nor any of its collaborative partners or other licensees has completed the development of drugs designed with the use of the company s technology and the company does not expect that any drugs resulting from its or its collaborative partners or other licensees research and development efforts will be commercially available for a number of years  if at all 
all compounds discovered by the company and its collaborative partners and other licensees will require extensive preclinical and clinical testing prior to submission of any regulatory application for commercial use 
extensive preclinical and clinical testing required to establish safety and efficacy will take several years  and the time required to commercialize new drugs cannot be predicted with accuracy 
moreover  potential products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may never reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include  but are not limited to  the possibilities that potential products are found during preclinical testing or clinical trials to be ineffective or to cause harmful side effects  that they fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  that they are difficult or uneconomical to manufacture on a large scale  that they fail to achieve market acceptance or that they are precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company s approach to drug discovery  its research and development efforts or the efforts of grunenthal  kissei  lilly  novartis or glaxo  or any future collaborative partner or other licensee of the company  will result in the development of any drugs  or that any drugs  if successfully developed  will be proven to be safe and effective in clinical trials  receive required regulatory approvals  be capable of being manufactured in commercial quantities at reasonable costs or be successfully commercialized 
product development of new pharmaceuticals is highly uncertain  and unanticipated developments  including clinical or regulatory delays  unexpected adverse effects and inadequate therapeutic efficacy  would slow or prevent product development efforts of the company and its collaborative partners and other licensees and have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
dependence on collaborative partners and licensees for development  regulatory approvals  manufacturing  marketing and other resources a key element of the company s business strategy is to leverage resources by entering into collaborative and licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies 
under the company s agreements with kissei  lilly and novartis  the company s collaborative partners and licensees are each responsible for conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials of compounds developed through the use of the company s technology  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and commercializing any resulting drugs 
under the grunenthal agreement  grunenthal is responsible for conducting certain preclinical testing and clinical trials of compounds developed through the use of the company s technology 
the company has no involvement in the research and development activities of glaxo under the glaxo agreement 
as a result  the company s receipt of revenues whether in the form of drug development milestones  royalties on sales or net sales proceeds in respect of drugs resulting from its collaborative and licensing arrangements is dependent upon the activities of its collaborative partners and other licensees 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by the company s collaborative partners and other licensees to the development of drugs that would be subject to royalties payable to the company are not within the company s control 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the interests of the company will continue to coincide with those of its collaborative partners or other licensees  that one or more of the company s collaborative partners or other licensees will not develop independently or with third parties drugs that could compete with drugs of the types covered by their arrangements with the company  or that disagreements over rights or technology or other proprietary interests will not occur 
if any of the company s collaborative partners or other licensees breaches its agreement with the company  or fails to devote adequate resources to or conduct in a timely manner its collaborative or licensed activities  the related research programs or the development and commercialization of drug candidates subject to such arrangement could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company s collaborative or licensing arrangements will be successful 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into acceptable collaborative or licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies in the future  or that  if negotiated  such arrangements will be successful 
history of operating losses and accumulated deficit the company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception in january at december   the company s accumulated deficit was  losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with the company s research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with the company s operations 
the company expects to continue to incur substantial operating losses at least over the next several years and expects losses to increase as research funding under its collaborative arrangements diminish 
as of december   the only revenues generated by the company had resulted from payments under collaborative and license agreements  and government grants under the sbir program of the national institutes of health 
the company s revenues  expenses and losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year 
research payments under the novartis agreements expired in  research payments under the merck agreement expired in february  and research payments under the lilly agreement expired in july the company anticipates that there will initially be little  if any  biological knowledge regarding many of its future gene discoveries and  as a result  it may have fewer opportunities to enter into collaborative arrangements focused on such discoveries 
the company does not expect to achieve revenues or royalties from sales of drugs for a number of years  if at all 
the company will not achieve revenues or royalties from drug sales unless it or one of its collaborative partners or other licensees successfully completes clinical trials with respect to a drug candidate  obtains regulatory approvals for that drug candidate and commercializes the resulting drug 
failure to achieve significant revenue or profitable operations could impair the company s ability to sustain operations and there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve significant revenues or profitable operations 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding the operation of the company s business requires substantial capital resources and such requirements are likely to increase in the future 
the company s future financial requirements will depend on many factors  including the continued progress of its research and development programs  the timing and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  if any  of its or its collaborative partners or other licensees drug candidates  the timing of regulatory approvals  if any  technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of its or its collaborative partners or other licensees proposed products and the status of competitive products 
the company s capital requirements will also depend on the company s ability to establish and maintain collaborative or licensing arrangements with others and on whether its future collaborative partners provide research funding to the company and are responsible for all development activities  preclinical testing and regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  the manufacturing and marketing of products 
in addition  such capital requirements will depend on the time and expense associated with filing and  if necessary  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims 
the company entered into the grunenthal agreement in january under this agreement  the company will retain certain ownership rights to products that result from the collaboration 
in addition  the company will be significantly involved in the development of any such potential products but may also be required to contribute substantial financial resources towards such development 
accordingly  the cost to the company of this arrangement may be significantly greater than the cost to it of participating in a royalty based collaboration 
no assurance can be given that the company s existing cash on hand and marketable securities and funds it will receive under its collaborative and license agreements  together with interest income  will be sufficient 
the company expects that it will  in the future  seek to raise additional funding from other sources  including other collaborative partners and licensees  and through public or private financings  including sales of equity or debt securities 
any such collaborative or licensing arrangement could result in limitations on the company s ability to control the research and development of potential drugs and the commercialization of resulting drugs  if any  as well as its profits therefrom 
any such equity financing could result in dilution to the company s then existing stockholders 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on favorable terms or at all  or that such funds  if raised  would be sufficient to permit the company to continue to conduct its operations 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to curtail significantly or eliminate one or more of its receptor or drug discovery programs 
uncertainties related to clinical trials before obtaining required regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of each product under development  the company or its collaborators and other licensees must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that such product is safe and efficacious for use 
the results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results that will be obtained from large scale clinical trials  and there can be no assurance that clinical trials of any product under development will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such product or will result in a marketable product 
the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic product under development by the company or its collaborative partners or other licensees must be supported by extensive data from clinical trials 
a number of companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  despite promising results in earlier trials 
the failure to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the fda or other regulatory agency may require additional clinical trials  which could result in increased costs and significant development delays 
the rate of completion of clinical trials of the company s or its collaborative partners and other licensees products is dependent upon  among other factors  obtaining adequate clinical supplies and the rate of patient accrual 
patient accrual is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the trial 
delays in planned patient enrollment in clinical trials may result in increased costs  program delays or both  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company s collaborative partners and other licensees generally have the right to control the planning and execution of product development and clinical programs  and there can be no assurance that such partners and licensees will conduct such programs in accordance with schedules that are satisfactory to the company 
there can be no assurance that  if clinical trials are completed  the company or its collaborative partners and other licensees will submit ndas with respect to any potential products or that any such application will be reviewed and approved by the fda in a timely manner  if at all 
lack of manufacturing experience  reliance on contract manufacturers the company currently has no manufacturing facilities and relies on its collaborative partners and other licensees or other manufacturers to produce its compounds for research and development  preclinical and clinical purposes 
the products under development by the company and its collaborative partners and other licensees have never been manufactured on a commercial scale and there can be no assurance that such products can be manufactured at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable 
if the company were unable to contract for a sufficient supply of its compounds on acceptable terms  or if it should encounter delays or difficulties in its relationships with manufacturers  any preclinical or clinical testing schedule of the company would be delayed  resulting in delay in the submission of products for regulatory approval or the market introduction and subsequent sales of such products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
moreover  manufacturers that the company may use must adhere to current gmp regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if these facilities cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda pre market approval of the products will not be granted 
lack of sales and marketing capability the creation of infrastructure to commercialize pharmaceutical products is a difficult  expensive and time consuming process 
synaptic currently has no sales or marketing capability 
to market directly any product it may develop  the company would need to establish a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and distribution capability or contract with other pharmaceutical and or health care companies with distribution systems and direct sales forces 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to establish direct or indirect sales and distribution capabilities or be successful in gaining market acceptance for licensing arrangements 
to the extent that the company enters into co promotion or licensing arrangements  any revenues received by the company will be dependent on the efforts of third parties  and there can be no assurance that any such efforts will be successful 
dependence on key personnel the company is highly dependent on its management and scientific staff 
loss of the services of any key individual could have an adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that its future success will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain highly talented managerial  scientific  software and bioinformatics personnel and consultants 
the company faces intense competition for such personnel from  among others  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as academic and other research institutions 
there can be no assurance that it will be able to attract and retain the personnel it requires on acceptable terms 
failure to attract and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 
external environment over the past several years  there has been a significant reduction in the number of investors who are willing to commit capital to the biotechnology industry 
with over public biotechnology companies and over  private biotechnology companies  the lack of capital is severely impairing the ability of many of these companies to carry out their research 
additionally  many pharmaceutical companies are now routinely performing many of the types of research and services that have historically been performed by biotechnology companies 
as a consequence  many pharmaceutical companies are less interested than in the past both in engaging in collaborations with biotechnology companies in a number of areas and in providing them with research funding and other sources of revenue 
over time  the company could be materially adversely affected by a lack of available capital and or a lack of interest on the part of the pharmaceutical industry in its services or products 
this unfavorable external environment could result in the company s inability to complete certain of its research projects and or in the need for the company to downsize until it begins to receive royalty income pursuant to outstanding licensing arrangements
