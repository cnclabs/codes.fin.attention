inflation the company does not believe inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations for the periods presented 
factors affecting future operating results the company s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
short term fluctuations in operating results may be caused by a variety of factors  including the relatively high unit cost of the company s motor coaches  the timing of orders from dealers  dealer cancellations of orders  the repurchase of coaches from dealers  new product introductions  production delays and the timing of trade shows and rallies 
because the company s gross profit is generally greater with respect to its more expensive coaches  changes in the product mix of coaches sold can affect the company s operating results 
over longer periods  the cyclical nature of the recreational vehicle industry  changes in interest rates and changes in the level of discretionary consumer spending may also adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the impact of these and other factors on the company s sales and operating results in any future period cannot be predicted with certainty  and the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period 
the company believes that the high line motor coach market is much less volatile than the rv industry as a whole  and believes buyers purchasing high line products are making lifestyle decisions largely independent of factors such as the state of the economy or interest rates 
high line coach sales have increased every year since  while the sale of all class a motor coaches have seen both increases and decreases during this period 
liquidity and capital resources during  net cash used in operating activities was million 
this was primarily the result of increased inventories primarily finished goods at the year end 
most of this inventory has been subsequently sold 
accounts receivable were over million higher than previous year end levels in part because of very heavy sales in the last two weeks of december 
the company generated million in cash from investing activities as the result of proceeds from the sale of assets including an airplane and certain real estate 
as part of the acquisition of the florida service center property  smc received million from the prior tenant for their release from a long term lease obligation 
the company maintains an operating line of credit of million and a real estate line of credit of million  plus an additional million equipment financing line of credit 
at december   the company utilized million of the operating line 
there was no utilization of the equipment line at december  there was approximately million utilized of the real estate line of credit at december  amounts outstanding under these lines of credit bear interest at a libor based rate at december  and are secured by all assets not specifically identified in other financing obligations 
the terms of the revolving credit and equipment financing agreements require compliance with certain financial and other covenants unless the company receives consent from the lender 
the covenants include restrictions relating to mergers  consolidations and sale of assets  guarantees by the company of debts or obligations of other persons or entities  acquisition of the company s own stock  and declaring or paying dividends in cash  stock  or other property 
the company was in compliance with all covenants and agreements at december  the company does not believe any of these covenants will have a material impact on the company s ability to meet its cash obligations

most dealer purchases of motor coaches from the company are financed under flooring financing arrangements between the dealer and a bank or finance company 
under these flooring arrangements  the financing institution lends the dealer all or substantially all of the wholesale purchase price of a motor coach and retains a security interest in the coach purchased 
these financing arrangements provide that  for a period of time after a coach is financed generally to months  if the dealer defaults on its payment or other obligations to the lender  the company is obligated to repurchase the dealer s inventory for the amount then due from the dealer plus  in certain circumstances  costs incurred by the lender in connection with repossession of the inventory 
the repurchase price may be more than the resale value of the coach 
the company s contingent liability under its repurchase obligations varies from time to time 
as of december   the company estimates its total contingent liability under repurchase obligations to be approximately million 
included in this amount is approximately million that is guaranteed by smc in the event one particular dealer fails to repay the finance company from sales proceeds 
to date  losses incurred by the company pursuant to repurchase obligations have not been material 
the company cannot predict with certainty its future losses  if any  pursuant to repurchase obligations  and these amounts may vary materially from the expenditures historically made by the company 
furthermore  even in circumstances where losses in connection with repurchase obligations are not material  a repurchase obligation can represent a significant cash requirement for the company
