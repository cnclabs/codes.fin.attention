overview flir systems was founded in and has become a world leader in the design  manufacture and marketing of thermal imaging and broadcast camera systems for a wide variety of commercial and government applications 
our business is organized around two principal markets  commercial and government 
historically  a majority of our revenue was derived from government sales 
however  we have shifted our product mix in favor of commercial applications  which accounted for and  respectively  of our revenue for the years ended december  and we continue to enhance our state of the art products within existing commercial and government markets  as well as develop products for new market applications that use advanced thermal imaging technology such as new uncooled detector technology that operates at room temperature  allowing for systems that are cheaper  smaller  lighter  and more energy efficient 
additionally  we have developed higher margin image analysis software tools that enhance the capability and customization of our commercial hand held products 
as hardware prices decline  the sophistication of image analysis software and the incremental functionality provided by such analysis tools are expected to become a more critical component of the commercial segment 
on march   we completed our merger with inframetrics  inc  a privately held thermal imaging company headquartered in billerica  massachusetts  by issuing approximately million shares of our common stock in exchange for all the outstanding stock of inframetrics 
as a result of the merger with inframetrics  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests see note to the consolidated financial statements  the consolidated financial statements and all amounts included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the combined operations and financial position for all such periods 
effective december   we acquired agema infrared systems ab  headquartered in stockholm  sweden 
agema was the world leader in the design  manufacture and marketing of handheld infrared cameras for detecting and measuring temperature differences for a wide variety of commercial and research applications 
because the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  includes agema s results only for the month of december international revenue accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of revenue 
with the acquisition of agema contributing a significant volume of sales denominated in foreign currencies  we have increased exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and changing dynamics of foreign competitiveness based on variations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
the company typically experiences longer payment cycles on its international sales  which can have an adverse impact upon the company s liquidity 
in addition  substantial portions of the company s operations are conducted outside the united states  particularly in sweden 
international sales and operations may be subject to risks such as the imposition of governmental controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  labor union activities  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  and general economic conditions 
the company experiences fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal fluctuations and customer sales cycles 
with the exception of and  revenue in the fourth quarter of each year generally has been significantly higher than any other quarter in that year and the first and  in some cases  the second quarter of the following year  due to the seasonal pattern of contracting by the us and certain foreign governments  the frequent requirement by international customers to take delivery of equipment prior to the end of december due to funding considerations  and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize yearly capital budgets prior to expiration 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s quarterly sales have historically occurred in the last month of each quarter  with sales frequently concentrated in the last week or days of the quarter 
such events are likely to continue to result in substantial fluctuations in quarterly results in the future 
as a result of such quarterly fluctuations in operating results  the company believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
restatement of financial statements in march the company determined that it was necessary to revise its financial statements and its interim financial statements 
the restatement was required because of incorrect consolidation of the company s subsidiary information  inaccurate inventory valuation  insufficient accruals of commission expense and the inadequate accumulation and misclassification of certain subsidiary costs 
as a result of these matters  certain costs and allowances were either not accrued or not recorded correctly during the appropriate periods 
in addition  in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which among other guidance clarifies certain conditions to be met in order to recognize revenue 
in april  in connection with the audit of the company s financial statements and in light of the focus on revenue recognition issues resulting from the issuance of sab  the company re examined its historical application of generally accepted accounting principles relating to revenue recognition and the terms underlying certain transactions in which title and the risks of ownership had transferred to the buyer  but physical delivery to the buyer had not occurred bill and hold transactions 
as a result of this review  the company modified its historical revenue recognition policy with respect to those bill and hold transactions 
in view of the cumulative effect of the unrecorded adjustments for costs and allowances  and the bill and hold revenue matters  the company restated its beginning retained earnings for as a result of the revenue recognition matters  its annual and fourth quarter consolidated financial statements for and its quarterly consolidated financial statements for the first three quarters of the financial statements and related notes set forth in this annual report reflect all such restatements  including changes to the tax provision for all periods presented 
as a result of the restatement  total revenues for the year ended december  were reduced by million from million as originally reported to million 
earnings were reduced by million from million as originally reported to million for the same period 
as a result of prior period adjustments for revenue recognition from bill and hold transactions  beginning retained earnings for was reduced by million 
the company s quarterly financial results for the first three quarters of and the fourth quarter of have also been restated 
as a result of the restatement  total revenues for the first three quarters of were increased from amounts previously reported by million from million as originally reported to million 
earnings were reduced by million from the net loss of million originally reported to a net loss of million for the same period 
for the fourth quarter of  revenues were reduced by million from million originally reported to million 
earnings were reduced by million from million originally reported to million for the same period

years ended december   and revenue 
revenue decreased  from million in to million in commercial revenue decreased  from in to million in the decrease was attributable to a reduction in sales of commercial airborne systems and certain commercial products sold to industrial customers 
revenue from the sale of government products rose  from million in to million in the increase was attributable to higher deliveries of the safire family of airborne products  particularly the star safire system that began significant shipments in higher deliveries of the milcam  a hand held surveillance product  also added to the increase of government sales compared to 
revenue increased  from million in to million in commercial revenue increased  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of agema s operations compared to one month of operations in revenue from the sale of government products rose  to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of agema s ground based products compared to one month of operations in international sales contribute a significant portion of overall revenue with europe and japan the most consistent source of sales 
international revenue in was million  representing of overall revenue 
this compared to international revenue of million  or of total revenue  and international revenue of million  or of total revenue 
gross profit 
as a percentage of revenue  gross profit declined to in compared to in the decline was primarily a result of the write off of million of duplicative inventory and products that were determined to have reached the end of life  both created by overlapping product lines as a result of the merger with inframetrics 
the write off was included in cost of goods sold 
exclusive of this write off  gross profit was 
gross profit for was negatively affected by lower than expected production and delivery volumes resulting in excess manufacturing costs that were not fully absorbed into the products 
these excess manufacturing costs were expensed in as a percentage of revenue  gross profit increased from in to in  primarily due to the million write off of duplicative inventories related to the agema acquisition that was included in cost of goods sold in exclusive of this write off  gross margin increased from for to for the improvement in was primarily attributable to a higher percentage of sales using uncooled technology  which has a more favorable cost structure compared to older technology 
research and development 
research and development expense increased  from million in to million in research and development expense increased in to facilitate the introduction of new products including the thermacam  sc  marflir  fireflir  ultra  ultramedia iii  star safire and star safire ii 
research and development expense increased  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of agema s research and development expense compared to one month of expense in selling and other operating costs 
selling and other operating costs increased  from million in to million in  and increased in from million in as a percentage of revenue  selling and other operating costs were   and in   and  respectively 
the increase in selling and other operating costs in reflect a variety of factors including expense increases due to anticipated higher volumes of business that were not fully realized  implementation costs for an enterprise resource planning system  higher commission expense  increased bad debt expense  higher costs from our uk operations and certain year end audit adjustments 
the increase in selling and other operating costs in in absolute dollar terms was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of agema s operations in compared to only one month in  costs associated with increased revenue  particularly the increase in international sales  expenses related to the expanded operations of our international operations and to increased personnel 
interest expense and other 
interest expense and other includes costs related to short term and long term debt  capital lease obligations  miscellaneous bank charges and expenses and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
interest expense and other was   and million for the years ended   and  respectively 
the increase in expense was primarily due to the increased short term debt as a result of the loss incurred in and increased working capital needs during each year 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate for  and was  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate has been substantially below the us statutory rate for a number of reasons  including recognition of a greater or lesser valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset  utilization of research and development tax credits  and benefits obtained from utilization of a foreign sales corporation and state income taxes 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
allows the recognition of deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will be utilized 
historically the company has recorded some valuation allowance for its gross deferred tax assets 
in  the valuation allowance was reduced because of the impact of the company s enhanced profitability at its international subsidiaries 
the valuation allowance was then increased in due to the reduced profitability in that year 
the company recognized a net tax provision in  despite a consolidated pre tax loss  because it did generate pre tax profits in certain jurisdictions 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards aggregating approximately million  which expire in the years through utilization of the company s acquired net operating loss carryforwards from fsi automation formerly known as optimas corporation is limited to future earnings of fsi automation and further limited to approximately  per year  as fsi automation experienced a cumulative change in ownership of more than within a three year period 
additionally  the company has various tax credits available aggregating million which expire in the years through finally  the company has a million deferred tax asset related to acquired in process research and development 
the realization of this deferred tax asset is dependent upon the ability of foreign subsidiaries to remit earnings to the us parent and is further limited to realization over a year period 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had short term borrowings net of cash on hand of million compared to million at december  the increase in short term borrowings during the year was principally caused by the requirement to finance operations during the year  capital expenditures during the year and due to the repayment of inframetrics existing long term debt  which aggregated million at december  at december   the company had inventories on hand of million compared to million at december  the decrease is primarily attributable to the write off of of duplicative inventory and products as a result of the merger with inframetrics 
excluding the write off  inventories rose million during the year 
the rise is the result of lower than anticipated delivery of products during the year  particularly at year end 
based on year end values the company experienced turns of inventory during the year  exclusive of the write off of duplicative inventory 
at december   the company had accounts receivable in the amount of million compared to million at december  the decrease in the level of accounts receivable was primarily due to the lower volume of sales experienced in the last quarter of compared to the same period in the reduction also reflects a much shorter collection cycle at the end of days sales outstanding decreased from at december  to at december  the company has improved its collection process and reduced the extension of terms beyond days 
the company s investing activities have consisted primarily of expenditures for fixed assets  which totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of expenditures in and a significant amount expended in relate to the company s investment in new productivity tools 
the two primary investments of this nature were for an enterprise resource planning erp system and for a sales force automation system 
the investment in erp was also necessary to be compliant for year software issues 
the company expects to spend approximately million to expand the erp system in to make its boston operations compatible with the rest of the organization 
the sales force automation system will assist management in assessing future business prospects and planning production 
the company entered into a credit agreement with a number of banks as of december  the credit agreement provides the company with a million revolving line of credit with interest at a fluctuating rate generally equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate of the primary lender for domestic borrowings  and libor for offshore borrowings 
the interest rates on borrowings under the agreement increase as the company s consolidated debt level increases 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings at december  was 
the credit agreement allows the company to elect  any time prior to december   to convert the entire principal balance under the credit agreement into a term loan that would be payable in subsequent equal monthly payments plus interest 
the credit agreement includes several negative covenants that  among other things  restrict the company s ability to incur new indebtedness 
the credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all the assets of the company and includes certain financial covenants such as consolidated tangible net worth  interest coverage ratio  leverage ratio and maximum accounts payable days 
as of december  and for the year then ended  the company was in violation of certain of the covenants 
the lenders have waived all such covenant violations as of december  and into and have modified the covenants for  including the addition of covenants with respect to minimum levels of revenue and ebitda 
the lenders have also increased the interest rates applicable to offshore borrowings under the agreement by 
additionally  the company  through one of its subsidiaries  has a  swedish kronar approximately million line of credit at at december  at december   the company had million outstanding on these lines 
the company believes that its existing cash and available credit facilities  financing available from other sources  continuing efforts to control costs  improved the collection of accounts receivable and management of inventory levels will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
impact of the year the company conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue 
the company identified that the internal manufacturing system acquired by the company in connection with the acquisition of agema was not year compliant  and installed a new enterprise resource planning system  both hardware and software  to correct this deficiency 
the company s existing product line was tested and reviewed to ensure year compliance  and the company s products under development were designed to be year compliant 
additionally  the company evaluated year compliance on products from its suppliers and partners 
a contingency plan for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario was developed 
both internal and external resources were employed to identify  correct or reprogram  and test the systems for year compliance 
the total cost of the project was approximately million and was funded through existing cash resources 
to date  the company has not encountered any material year problems with respect to products  internal systems or any third party products or systems 
in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of agema in december  the company expensed million representing purchased in process research and development ipr d that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
these expenditures were recognized as a period expense in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
see note of the notes to the financial statements for a further discussion of the agema acquisition 
the million value assigned to ipr d was assigned to three separate technological projects series uncooled products million  uncooled technology million and qwip technology million 
the nature of the efforts required to develop these projects into commercially viable products includes the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
at the date of acquisition  the estimated total cost to be incurred to develop the ipr d into commercially variable products was approximately million in the aggregate through the year the value assigned to the ipr d was determined by an independent appraiser using a discounted cash flow method 
this involved estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flow from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used was  which included a factor that is intended to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology 
the resulting net cash flows were based on management s estimates of revenue over a five year period  cost of sales  research and development expenses  selling  general and administrative expense and income taxes from such projects  which were consistent with historical rates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the required work in order to develop these projects into commercially viable products 
if the ipr d projects discussed above are not successfully developed  the revenue and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short term and long term debt obligations 
the company currently hedges interest rate exposure through the use of long term interest rate swaps 
the company believes that its net income or cash flow exposure relating to rate changes for short term and long term debt obligations are immaterial 
interest expense is affected by the general level of us interest rates and or libor 
the foreign subsidiaries of the company generally use their local currency as the functional currency 
the company does not currently enter into any foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and inter company balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
to date  such exposure has been immaterial 
the company does maintain small cash balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar  the company believes that the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an immaterial amount
