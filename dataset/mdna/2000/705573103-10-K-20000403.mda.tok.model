item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations during  the company recognized revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as issued by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa 
under sop  revenue from software license arrangements was generally recognized upon delivery and product acceptance pursuant to non cancellable license agreements  and was based on management s assessment that the collectibility of the long term license installments was probable 
additionally  upon acceptance the company must have had no significant remaining vendor obligations regarding the licensed software 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sop  software revenue recognition  as issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
under sop  software license fees are recognized upon customer acceptance of the software when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance arrangement 
sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  and sop modification of sop with respect to certain transactions  issued by the aicpa during  deferred and modified certain provisions of sop beginning in  all of the provisions of sop  as modified  will be effective 
the company s revenue is derived from two sources software license fees and service fees 
software license fees are generally payable on a monthly basis under license agreements  which generally have a five year term and may be renewed for additional years at the customer s option 
the present value of future license payments is generally recognized as revenue upon acceptance 
for purposes of the present value calculations  the discount rate used has varied between and for the three years ended december  a portion of the fee from each arrangement is initially deferred and recognized as interest income over the rest of the license term 
the company s services revenue is comprised of fees for implementation  maintenance  training and consulting services 
software license customers are offered the ability to enter into a maintenance contract requiring the customer to pay a monthly maintenance fee over the term of the related license agreement 
maintenance fees are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
the company s software implementation agreements typically require the company to provide a specified level of implementation services for a specified fee  typically with additional implementation services available at an hourly rate 
implementation fees are recognized once the fair value of services and any other elements to be delivered under the arrangement can be determined  which has typically occurred upon customer acceptance for fixed price projects and as incurred for time and material projects 
the company generally recognizes training and consulting fees as the services are provided 
the company does not defer costs related to the service elements for which revenue recognition has been deferred 
in arrangements that include multiple elements eg  software license  implementation services  training  etc  the total fees under the arrangement are deferred until such time as the fair value of each element to be delivered under the contract can be determined  which typically has occurred upon customer acceptance for fixed price projects and as incurred for time and material projects 
the total revenue is allocated to the individual elements based on the relative fair values 
deferred revenue at december  consisted primarily of service fees from arrangements for which acceptance of the software license had not occurred and the fair value of free consulting hours committed by the company that had not been performed 
the company s international revenues have fluctuated in the past due to the fact that such revenues have been largely attributable to a small number of product acceptances during a given period 
international revenues were   and of total consolidated revenues in   and  respectively 
most of the company s contracts are denominated in u 
s dollars 
the company expects that in the future more of its contracts may be denominated in foreign currencies 
the company has not experienced any significant foreign exchange gains or losses  and the company does not expect that foreign currency fluctuations will significantly affect its financial position or results of operations 
the company s business has historically experienced a lack of predictable revenues 
the timing of revenue recognition is related to the completion of implementation services and acceptance of the licensed software by the customer  the timing of which has proven to be difficult to predict accurately 
in  there was a reduction in the size of the company s sales force of almost 
given the intense competition for qualified sales personnel and the significant amount of time required to train new sales personnel  this reduction may adversely affect the company s ability to meet its future sales goals 
in addition  because of the reduced size of the company s sales force  the company is more focused on closing larger but fewer license transactions than in the past 
this may increase the volatility in the company s quarterly operating results 
on three separate occasions during the two year period ended december   the company discovered errors in its previously reported financial statements that required it to restate its quarterly or annual financial statements 
in addition  on august   the company announced the restatement of its financial statements for the year ended december  and the unaudited three month period ended march  as part of the company s closing for the three month period ended june   the company discovered errors in the previously released results of operations for the three month periods ended december  and march  the errors  which were caused by incorrectly bookkeeping certain credit memos and cash receipts related to previously reversed or deferred revenue  resulted in an understatement of service revenue and an overstatement of costs for each of the periods effected

the company s independent public accountants have identified in connection with their audits of the company s  and financial statements material weaknesses in the company s internal control environment 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations as of january   the company refined its method of classifying costs and expenses by directly charging costs to their appropriate functional classifications 
during and  all costs were allocated to the classifications using a method based on the classification s salaries 
results for and have been reclassified to conform with the current methodology

services revenue for increased to million from million for the increase in services revenue was primarily attributable to additional consulting services provided to existing customers  the recognition of previously deferred revenue from service projects that were completed  and the reclassification of certain revenue that would otherwise have been classified as license revenue because the fair value of revenue associated with implementing the license software was greater than expected  and to a lesser extent  increased maintenance revenue from a larger installed product base

liquidity and capital resources from inception until the company s initial public offering of common stock  the company funded its operations primarily through cash flow from operations and bank borrowings 
in july  the company issued and sold million shares of common stock in connection with its initial public offering 
net proceeds to the company from such offering were approximately million 
in january  the company issued and sold million shares of common stock in connection with a second public offering 
net proceeds to the company from such second public offering were approximately million 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
net cash provided by used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
in  cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a reduction in accounts receivable of million offset by operating cash losses 
the increase in cash from operating activities resulted from improved billing practices which reduced the time between when services are performed and when such services are billed  and intensified collection efforts 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively

the company s total expense under such leases was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund the company s operations for the near term 
there can be no assurance however  that changes in the company s plans or other events affecting the company s operations will not result in materially accelerated or unexpected expenditures 
in addition  there can be no assurance that additional capital if needed will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such time as required by the company 
effect of the year issue as of the date of this filing  we have not incurred any significant business disruptions nor have we encountered any significant issues with respect to our software products as a result of year issues 
however  while no such significant occurrence has developed  year issues that may arise related to key suppliers and service providers may not become apparent immediately 
we have received assurances from key suppliers and service providers such as financial institutions  our payroll service provider and our retirement plan administrator as to their year readiness 
we can provide no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by these suppliers and service providers due to noncompliance in the future 
we have funded our year plan from operating cash flows and have not separately accounted for these costs in the past 
to date  the costs have not been material 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operating results to date  and the company does not expect it to have a significant impact in the future 
the company s unbilled license and maintenance fees are typically subject to annual increases based on recognized inflation indexes 
significant customers in and respectively  the company had one customer that accounted for and of the company s total consolidated revenue 
in  the company had two customers that accounted for and  respectively  of the company s total consolidated revenue 
forward looking statements this annual report contains certain forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause the company s operating results to differ materially or adversely are discussed below 
the company faces litigation 
negative publicity resulting from the company s delayed sec filings and its restatements of prior period financial statements have made sales more difficult to close 
the company is presently a defendant in two private securities litigation matters 
although the company intends to defend these actions vigorously  no assurance can be given as to the outcomes 
it is possible that the company may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operation 
in addition  regardless of the outcome of any of these actions  it is likely that the company will incur substantial defense costs and that such actions will cause a diversion of management time and attention 
the company s delays in sec filings and adjustments made to previously published financial statements have resulted in negative publicity for the company 
such events and related publicity have adversely affected demand for the company s products and services 
the company is being investigated by the securities and exchange commission 
since may of  the boston office of the securities and exchange commission sec issued a formal order of private investigation of the company and certain individuals  currently or formerly associated with the company  are presently being investigated by the sec concerning past accounting matters  financial reports and other public disclosures and trading activity in the company s securities during and such investigation may result in the sec imposing fines on the company or taking other measures that may have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in addition  regardless of the outcome of the investigation  it is likely that the company will incur substantial defense costs and that such investigation will cause a diversion of management time and attention 
finally  the negative publicity resulting from the investigation has made and may continue to make it more difficult for the company to close sales  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company continues to have material weaknesses in its internal control environment 
the company s independent public accountants have identified in connection with their audits of the company s  and financial statements material weaknesses in the company s internal control environment 
in connection with the completion of the audit  they informed the company that their management letter would include a recommendation to  among other things  strengthen the resources in the company s finance organization to improve financial accounting and internal controls 
although the company is actively seeking to hire additional qualified personnel into such organization  these efforts have proved to be difficult and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts in the near term 
the inability to hire such personnel could have a material adverse impact on the company s reputation and on its financial condition and results of operations 
the company s stock price has been volatile 
quarterly results have and are likely to fluctuate significantly 
the market price of the company s common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
factors that are difficult to predict  such as quarterly revenues and operating results  statements and ratings by financial analysts  overall market performance and the outcome of litigation  will have a significant effect on the price for shares of the company s common stock 
revenues and operating results have varied considerably in the past from period to period and are likely to vary considerably in the future 
the company plans product development and other expenses based on anticipated future revenue 
if revenue falls below expectations  financial performance is likely to be adversely affected because only a small portion of expenses vary with revenue 
as a result  period to period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon to predict future performance 
the timing of license revenues is related to the completion of implementation services and product acceptance by the customer  the timing of which has been difficult to predict accurately 
there can be no assurance that pegasystems will be profitable on an annual or quarterly basis or that earnings or revenues will meet analysts expectations 
fluctuations may be particularly pronounced because a significant portion of revenues in any quarter is attributable to product acceptance or license renewal by a relatively small number of customers 
fluctuations also reflect a policy of recognizing revenue upon product acceptance or license renewal in an amount equal to the present value of the total committed payments due during the term 
customers generally do not accept products until the end of a lengthy sales cycle and an implementation period  typically ranging from one to six months but in some cases significantly longer 
risks over which the company has little or no control  including customers budgets  staffing allocation  and internal authorization reviews  can significantly affect the sales and acceptance cycles 
changes dictated by customers may delay product implementation and revenue recognition 
the company will need to develop new products  evolve existing ones  and adapt to technological change 
technological developments  customer requirements  programming languages and industry standards change frequently in the company s markets 
as a result  success in current markets and new markets will depend upon the company s ability to enhance current products  to develop and introduce new products that meet customer needs  keep pace with technological changes  respond to competitive products  and achieve market acceptance 
product development requires substantial investments for research  refinement and testing 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to make necessary product development investments 
pegasystems may experience difficulties that will delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or implementation of new or enhanced products 
inability to introduce or implement new or enhanced products in a timely manner would adversely affect future financial performance 
the company s products are complex and may contain errors 
errors in products will require the company to ship corrected products to customers 
errors in products could cause the loss of or delay in market acceptance or sales and revenue  the diversion of development resources  injury to the company s reputation  or increased service and warranty costs which would have an adverse effect on financial performance 
the company has historically sold to the financial services market 
this market is consolidating rapidly  and faces uncertainty due to many other factors 
the company has historically derived a significant portion of its revenue from customers in the financial services market  and its future growth depends  in part  upon increased sales to this market 
competitive pressures  industry consolidation  decreasing operating margins within this industry  currency fluctuations  geographic expansion and deregulation affect the financial condition of the company s customers and their willingness to pay 
in addition  customers purchasing patterns are somewhat discretionary 
as a result  some or all of the factors listed above may adversely affect the demand by customers 
the financial services market is undergoing intense domestic and international consolidation 
in recent years  several customers have been merged or consolidated 
future mergers or consolidations may cause a decline in revenues and adversely affect the company s future financial performance 
the company s growth strategy requires expansion into new vertical markets 
the results of this strategy are uncertain 
a critical part of the company s growth strategy is to continue selling products to markets other than financial services  such as insurance  telecommunications  and health care 
the company will need to hire additional personnel with expertise in these other markets and otherwise invest in people and technologies to facilitate this expansion 
deterioration in economic or market conditions generally may also adversely affect the demand by customers in these other markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selling products to these other markets or in continuing to attract and retain personnel with the necessary industry expertise 
inability to effectively penetrate these other markets could have an adverse effect on future financial performance 
if existing customers do not renew their licenses  the company s financial results may suffer 
a significant portion of total revenue has been attributable to license renewals 
while historically a substantial majority of customers have renewed their licenses  there can be no assurance that a substantial majority of customers will continue to renew expiring licenses 
a decrease in license renewals absent offsetting revenue from other sources would have a material adverse effect on future financial performance 
in addition  possible transition to a prepaid extended term license may have a material adverse impact on the amount of license renewal revenues in future periods 
the company depends on certain key personnel  and must be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future 
the business is dependent on a number of key  highly skilled technical  managerial  consulting  sales and marketing personnel  including mr 
trefler  the company s chief executive officer 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect financial performance 
the company does not have any significant key man life insurance on any officers or employees and does not plan to put any in place 
the company s success will depend in large part on the ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
the number of potential employees who have the extensive knowledge of computer hardware and operating systems needed to develop  sell and maintain its products is limited  and competition for their services is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain such personnel 
if the company is unable to do so  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
several senior managers of the company have resigned over the last year 
the market for the company s offerings is increasingly and intensely competitive  rapidly changing  and highly fragmented 
the market for customer relationship management software and related implementation  consulting and training services is intensely competitive and highly fragmented 
the company currently encounters significant competition from internal information systems departments of potential or existing customers that develop custom software 
it also competes with companies that target the customer interaction and workflow markets and professional services organizations that develop custom software in conjunction with rendering consulting services 
competition for market share and pressure to reduce prices and make sales concessions are likely to increase 
many competitors have far greater resources and may be able to respond more quickly and efficiently to new or emerging technologies  programming languages or standards or to changes in customer requirements or preferences 
competitors may also be able to devote greater managerial and financial resources to develop  promote and distribute products and provide related consulting and training services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company must manage increased business complexity and growth effectively 
the business has grown in size  geographic scope and complexity and product offerings and the customer base has expanded 
this growth and expansion has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on management  operations and capital needs 
continued growth will require the company to hire  train and retrain many employees in the united states and abroad  particularly additional sales and financial personnel 
the company will also need to enhance its financial and managerial controls and reporting systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will attract and retain the personnel necessary to meet its business challenges 
failure to manage growth effectively may materially adversely affect future financial performance 
the company suffered recent attrition in its sales force 
in  there was a reduction in the size of the company s sales force of almost 
given the intense competition for qualified sales personnel and the significant amount of time required to train new sales personnel  this reduction may adversely affect the company s ability to meet its future sales goals 
in addition  because of the reduced size of the company s sales force  the company is more focused on closing larger but fewer license transactions than in the past 
this may increase the volatility in the company s quarterly operating results 
the company relies on certain third party relationships 
the company has a number of relationships with third parties that are significant to sales  marketing and support activities and product development efforts 
the company relies on relational database management system applications and development tool vendors  software and hardware vendors  and consultants to provide marketing and sales opportunities for the direct sales force and to strengthen the company s products through the use of industry standard tools and utilities 
the company also has relationships with third parties that distribute its products 
in particular  the company relies on its relationship with first data corporation for the distribution of products to the credit card and mutual fund markets and on carreker antinori  inc for the distribution of its products to the banking industry 
there can be no assurance that these companies  most of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources  will not develop or market products that compete with those of the company in the future or will not otherwise end their relationships with or support of the company 
the company may face product liability and warranty claims 
the company s license agreements typically contain provisions intended to limit the nature and extent of the company s risk of product liability and warranty claims 
there is a risk that a court might interpret these terms in a limited way or could hold part or all of these terms to be unenforceable 
also  there is a risk that these contract terms might not bind a party other than the direct customer 
furthermore  some of the company s licenses with its customers are governed by non us law  and there is a risk that foreign law might give the company less or different protection 
although the company has not experienced any material product liability claims to date  a product liability suit or action claiming a breach of warranty  whether or not meritorious  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and the company s resources 
the euro s adoption imposes product and market risks 
a new currency  the euro  was introduced in certain economic and monetary union emu countries in early it is expected that by at the latest all participating emu countries will use the euro as their single currency 
as a result  software used by many companies headquartered or maintaining a subsidiary in a participating emu country is expected to be euro enabled 
in less than three years  all companies headquartered or maintaining a subsidiary in an emu country will need to be euro enabled 
these changes will change budgetary  accounting and fiscal systems in companies and public administration  and require the simultaneous handling of parallel currencies and conversion of legacy data 
these requirements and the fact that the final rules and regulations are not yet available may curb market demand for the company s products because the budgets and priorities of its customers and prospective customers may change 
the company is monitoring the rules and regulations as they become known in order to make any changes to its software products that the company deems necessary to comply with such rules and regulations 
although the company believes that its most recent products address these requirements  there can be no assurance that  once the final rules and regulations are completed  the company s software will contain all of the necessary changes or meet all of the euro requirements 
any inability to comply with the euro requirements could have an adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company faces risks from operations and customers based outside of the us sales to customers headquartered outside of the united states represented approximately   and of the company s total revenue in   and  respectively 
the company  in part through its wholly owned subsidiaries based in the united kingdom  singapore  sweden and australia  markets products and renders consulting and training services to customers based in canada  the united kingdom  france  switzerland  ireland  luxembourg  mexico  sweden  australia  austria  hong kong and singapore 
the company has established offices in continental europe and in australia 
the company believes that its continued growth will necessitate expanded international operations requiring a diversion of managerial attention and financial resources 
the company anticipates hiring additional personnel to accommodate international growth  and the company may also enter into agreements with local distributors  representatives  or resellers 
if the company is unable to do one or more of these things in a timely manner  the company s growth  if any  in its foreign operations will be restricted  and the company s business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for its products 
most of the company s international sales are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  any appreciation of the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies of those countries in which the company distributes its products may place the company at a competitive disadvantage by effectively making its products more expensive as compared to those of its competitors 
additional risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  increased tariffs and other trade barriers  the costs of localizing products for local markets and complying with local business customs  longer accounts receivable patterns and difficulties in collecting foreign accounts receivable  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights  heightened risks of political and economic instability  the possibility of nationalization or expropriation of industries or properties  difficulties in managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of double taxation  enhanced accounting and internal control expenses  and the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s foreign operations  and  consequentially  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company faces risks related to intellectual property claims or appropriation of its intellectual property rights 
the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secrets laws  as well as confidentiality agreements to protect its proprietary rights 
in october  the company was granted a patent by the united states patent and trademark office relating to the architecture of the company s systems 
there can be no assurance that such patent will not be invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted thereunder or the description contained therein will provide competitive advantages to the company s competitors or others 
moreover  despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain the use of information that the company regards as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
the company is not aware that any of its products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties
