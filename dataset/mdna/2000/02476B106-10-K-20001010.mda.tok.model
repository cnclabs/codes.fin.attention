item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following financial review and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations  for the years ended june   and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and other detailed information appearing in this document 
general we are a diversified financial services company operating throughout the united states 
we originate  sell and service business purpose loans  home equity loans and conventional first mortgage loans through our principal direct and indirect subsidiaries 
we also underwrite  process and purchase home equity loans through the bank alliance program whereby we purchase home equity loans from financial institutions that meet our underwriting criteria but do not meet the underlying guidelines of the selling institutions for loans to be held in the portfolio of the selling institutions 
following our purchase of the loans through this program  we hold these loans as available for sale until they are sold in connection with a future securitization 
loans originated primarily consist of fixed rate loans secured by first or second mortgages on single family residences 
our customers include credit impaired borrowers and other borrowers who would qualify for loans from traditional sources but who are attracted to our loan products due to our personalized service  and timely response to loan applications 
we originate loans through a combination of channels including a centralized processing center located in bala cynwyd  pennsylvania and a retail branch network of offices 
in addition  we offer subordinated debt securities to the public  the proceeds of which are used to repay existing debt  fund loan originations  our operations and for general corporate purposes 
due to increases in market interest rates  we expect our ability to originate loans at rates that will maintain our current level of profitability will become more difficult than during a stable or falling interest rate environment 
we are addressing this challenge by carefully monitoring our product pricing  the actions of our competition and market trends in order to continue to originate loans in as profitable a manner as possible 
the higher interest rate environment could also unfavorably impact our liquidity and capital resources 
higher interest rates could impact our short term liquidity by widening investor spread requirements in pricing future securitizations  increasing the levels of overcollateralization in future securitizations  limiting our access to borrowings in the capital markets and limiting our ability to sell our subordinated debt securities at favorable interest rates 
in a rising interest rate environment  short term and long term liquidity could also be impacted by increased interest costs on all sources of borrowed funds  including the subordinated debt  and by reducing spreads on our securitized loans which would reduce our cash flows 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of both long and short term liquidity and risk factors if we are not able to sustain the levels of growth in revenues and earnings that we experienced in the past our future profits may be reduced 
prior to december  we also originated equipment leases 
effective december   we de emphasized the leasing origination business in keeping with our strategy of focusing on our most profitable lines of business 
we are continuing to service the remaining leases in our managed portfolio  which totaled million in gross receivables at june  we may from time to time consider originating or purchasing new leases 
a recent focus by state and federal banking regulatory agencies  state attorneys general offices  the federal trade commission  the us department of justice and the us department of housing and urban development relates to predatory lending practices by companies in our industry 
sanctions have been imposed on selected industry competitors for practices including  but not limited to  charging borrowers excess fees  imposing higher interest rates than the borrower s credit risk warrants and failing to disclose the material terms of loans to the borrowers 
we have reviewed our lending policies in light of these actions against other lenders and we believe we are in compliance with all lending related guidelines 
to date  no sanctions or recommendations from governmental regulatory agencies regarding our practices related to predatory lending have been imposed 
we are unable to predict whether state or federal regulatory authorities will require changes in our lending practices in the future or the impact of those changes on our profitability 
see risk factors our residential lending business is subject to government regulation and licensing requirements which may hinder our ability to operate profitably 
securitizations in fiscal  a write down of million was recorded on our interest only strips 
the write down included a charge of million related to an increase from to in the discount rate used to value our interest only strips 
this change in the discount rate was considered a permanent fair value adjustment and was recorded as expense in fiscal the write down also included a charge of million for the impact of changes in one month libor deemed to be permanent 
a portion of the certificates issued to investors by our securitization trusts have floating interest rates based on the value of an adjustable market interest rate index  one month libor  plus a spread 
the fair value of the excess cash flow we will receive from these trusts would be affected by any changes in rates paid on the floating rate certificates 
additionally  the write down included a credit of million for the net impact of adjustments made to the prepayment assumptions on mortgage loan securitizations at june  the fair value of our interest only strips at june  was million 
see securitization accounting considerations for a discussion of the discount rate and prepayment assumptions 
see interest rate risk management interest only strips and servicing rights for a discussion of the impact of one month libor 
the ongoing securitization of loans is a central part of our current business strategy 
we sell loans and have in the past sold leases through securitizations with servicing retained 
this strategy generates the cash proceeds to repay warehouse and line of credit facilities  to fund additional loan originations and to provide additional sources of revenue through retained mortgage and lease servicing rights 
the following table summarizes the volume of loans and leases securitized and whole loan sales for the years ended june   and dollars in millions year ended june  securitizations business loans home equity loans equipment leases total  whole loan sales gain on sale of loans and leases through securitizations securitization gains as a percentage of total revenues gains on whole loan sales our quarterly revenues and net income have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future principally as a result of the timing  size and profitability of securitizations 
the strategy of selling loans through securitizations requires building an inventory of loans and leases over time  during which time we incur costs and expenses 
since a gain on sale is not recognized until a securitization is closed  which may not occur until a subsequent quarter  operating results for a given quarter can fluctuate significantly 
if securitizations do not close when expected  we could experience a materially adverse effect on our results of operations for a quarter 
in addition  due to the timing difference between the period when costs are incurred in connection with the origination of loans and their subsequent sale through the securitization process  we have operated on a negative cash flow basis in the past and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the foreseeable future  which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our liquidity and cash flows and risk factors since we have historically experienced negative cash flows from our operations and expect to do so in the foreseeable future  our ability to repay the investment notes could be impaired 
several factors affect our ability to complete securitizations on a profitable basis  including conditions in the securities markets generally  such as  fluctuations in interest rates described below  conditions in the asset backed securities markets relating to the types of financial assets we originate and credit quality of the managed portfolio of loans 
any substantial reduction in the size or availability of the securitization market for loans could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
recent movements in market interest rates will negatively impact the profitability of our future securitizations 
the profitability of our securitizations may be unfavorably impacted to the extent we hold fixed rate mortgage loans pending securitization and market interest rates increase prior to the securitization of those fixed rate loans 
although the loan coupon rate is fixed at the time the loan is originated  the interest rate paid to investors in the securitization  called the pass through rate  is not fixed until the pricing of the securitization which occurs just prior to the sale of the loans 
our gain on sale of loans in a securitization will be reduced if the spread between the average coupon rate on our fixed rate loans  and the weighted average pass through rate paid to investors for interests issued in connection with a securitization declines 
since our september mortgage loan securitization  the pass through rates on the asset backed securities issued in our securitizations have increased by approximately 
during this period  the average coupon on our loans securitized has increased 
the spread between the average coupon rate on the loans and the pass through rate to investors could be reduced further if  for example  market interest rates continue to increase 
because the coupon on our loans securitized has been relatively high  we have been able to absorb this net reduction in spread and have continued to access the asset backed securities markets 
we estimate that each reduction in the spread reduces the gain on sale of loans as a percentage of loans securitized by approximately 
see interest rate risk management for further detail 
we are continuously monitoring market rate fluctuations  our loan pricing and our hedging strategy in order to attempt to manage these changes and maintain our current level of profitability in connection with the securitization of loans 
see risk factors a change in market interest rates may result in a reduction in our profits 
in addition  as the spread is reduced  we are required to increase the level of overcollateralization which is required to provide additional protection to trust investors 
decreased spread has contributed to an increase in the required final overcollateralization amount by approximately of the initial balance of loans securitized since september the increase in the overcollateralization amount negatively impacts the timing of the cash flows from the interest only strips 
see securitization accounting considerations for a discussion of overcollateralization amounts 
our strategy of securitizing loans could also impact our future profitability to the extent that the carrying value of our interest only strips may require negative adjustments 
we generally retain interest only strips and servicing rights in the securitization transactions we complete 
we estimate the fair value of the interest only strips and servicing rights based upon estimated discount rates and prepayment and default assumptions 
together  these two assets represent of our total assets at june  the value of our interest only strips totaled million and the value of our servicing rights totaled million at june  although we believe that these amounts represent the fair value of these assets  the amounts were estimated based on discounting the expected cash flows to be received in connection with our securitizations using estimated discount rates  prepayment rates and default rate assumptions 
changes in market interest rates may impact our discount rate assumptions and our actual prepayment and default experience may vary materially from these estimates 
even a small unfavorable change in these assumptions utilized could have a significant adverse impact on the value of these assets 
in the event of an unfavorable change in these assumptions  the fair value of these assets would be overstated  requiring an adjustment which would adversely affect our income in the period of adjustment 
our business strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify and emphasize lending related activities that will provide us with the most economic value 
the implementation of this strategy will depend in large part on a variety of factors outside of our control  including  but not limited to  our ability to obtain adequate financing on favorable terms  profitably securitize our loans on a regular basis and continue to expand in the face of increasing competition 
our failure with respect to any of these factors could impair our ability to successfully implement our strategy  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
whole loan sales we also sell loans with servicing released referred to as whole loan sales 
gains on whole loan sales equal the difference between the net proceeds from such sales and the loans net carrying value 
the net carrying value of loans is equal to their principal balance plus unamortized origination costs and fees 
gains from these sales are recorded as fee income 
subordinated debt and other borrowings we also rely upon funds generated by the sale of subordinated debt and other borrowings to fund our operations and to repay subordinated debt 
at june   million of subordinated debt was outstanding and credit facilities and lines of credit totaling million were available  of which million was drawn upon on that date 
we expect to continue to rely on the borrowings to fund loans prior to securitization 
securitization accounting considerations when we securitize our loans and leases by selling them to trusts we receive cash and an interest only strip  which represents our retained interest in the securitized loans and leases 
the trust issues multi class securities  which derive their cash flows from the pool of securitized loans and leases 
these securities  which are senior to our interest only strips in the trusts  are sold to public investors 
in addition  when we securitize our loans and leases we retain the right  for a fee paid to us  to service the loans and leases which creates an asset that we refer to as our servicing rights 
servicing includes billing and collecting payments from borrowers  transmitting payments to investors  accounting for principal and interest  collections and foreclosure activities and disposing of real estate owned 
as the holder of the interest only strips received in a securitization  we are entitled to receive excess or residual cash flows 
these cash flows are the difference between the payments made by the borrowers on securitized loans and leases and the sum of the scheduled and prepaid principal and pass through interest paid to the investors in the trust  servicing fees  trustee fees and  if applicable  surety fees 
surety fees are paid to an unrelated insurance entity to provide protection for the trust investors 
overcollateralization is the excess of the aggregate principal balances of loans and leases in a securitized pool over investor interests 
overcollateralization requirements are established to provide additional protection for the trust investors 
the overcollateralization requirements for a mortgage loan securitization  which are different for each securitization  include the initial requirement  which is a percentage of the original balance of loans securitized and is paid in cash at the time of sale  the final target  which is a percentage of the original balance of loans securitized and is funded from the monthly excess cash flow  and the stepdown overcollateralization requirement  which is a percentage of the remaining balance of loans securitized 
during the stepdown period  the overcollateralization amount is gradually reduced through cash payments to us 
the stepdown period begins at the later of months or when the remaining balance of loans securitized is less than of the original balance of securitized loans 
at june   investments in interest only strips in securitizations totaled million including investments in overcollateralization of million 
in march  we amended our arrangements with a warehouse lender to include an off balance sheet mortgage loan conduit facility 
the sale into the off balance sheet conduit facility involves a two step transfer that qualifies for sale accounting under sfas no 
first we sell the loans to a special purpose entity which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the loans 
next the special purpose entity sells the loans to a qualified special purpose entity the facility for cash proceeds generated by its sale of notes to a third party purchaser 
we have no obligation to repurchase the loans and neither the third party note purchaser nor the facility has a right to require such repurchase 
the facility has the option to re securitize the loans  ordinarily using longer term certificates 
if the loans are not re securitized by the facility  the third party note purchaser has the right to securitize or sell the loans 
under this arrangement  the loans have been isolated from us and our subsidiaries  and  as a result  the transfer to the conduit facility is treated as a sale for financial reporting purposes 
during fiscal  we sold approximately million in principal amount of loans to the conduit facility and recognized gains on those sales totaling approximately million 
in june  million of loans in the conduit facility were re securitized by the facility 
at june  there were million in principal amount of loans in the conduit facility and an additional million in the on balance sheet facility

gains on sale of loans and leases through securitizations represent the difference between our net proceeds and the allocated cost of loans and leases securitized 
the allocated cost of the loans and leases securitized is determined by allocating their net carrying value between the loans and leases securitized  the interest only strips and the servicing rights retained  based upon their relative fair values 
the calculation of the fair value of interest only strips is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis which estimates the present value of the future expected excess cash flows utilizing assumptions made by management at the time loans are sold 
these original assumptions include the rate used to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows  referred to as the discount rate  the rates of prepayment and credit loss rates on the pool of loans 
the prepayment rate of loans may be affected by a variety of economic and other factors  including prevailing interest rates and the availability of alternative financing to borrowers 
the effect of those factors on loan prepayment rates may vary depending on the type of loan 
estimates of prepayment rates and credit loss rates are made based on management s expectation of future experience  which are based  in part  on the historical experience and in the case of prepayment rate assumptions  consideration of the impact of changes in market interest rates 
our interest only strips and servicing rights are periodically evaluated based upon the present value of the expected future cash flows from our interest only strips and servicing rights related to the loans remaining in the trusts 
the current assumptions for prepayment and credit loss rates are monitored against actual experience and would be adjusted if necessary 
in fiscal  a write down of million was recorded on our interest only strips 
the write down included a charge of million related to an increase from to in the discount rate used to value our interest only strips 
this change in the discount rate was considered a permanent fair value adjustment and was recorded as expense in fiscal the write down also included a charge of million for the impact of changes in one month libor deemed to be permanent 
a portion of the certificates issued to investors by securitization trusts have floating interest rates based on one month libor plus a spread 
the fair value of the excess cash flow we will receive from these trusts would be affected by any changes in rates paid on the floating rate certificates 
see interest rate risk management interest only strips and servicing rights for a discussion of the impact of one month libor 
additionally  the write down included a credit of million for the net favorable impact of adjustments made to the prepayment assumptions on mortgage loan securitizations to reflect actual experience at june  we use a discount rate which we believe is commensurate with the risks involved in our securitization assets 
while quoted market prices on comparable interest only strips are not available  we have performed comparisons of our valuation assumptions and performance experience to others in the non conventional mortgage industry 
we quantify the risks in our securitization assets by comparing the asset quality and performance experience of the underlying securitized mortgage pools to comparable industry performance 
we believe that the practice of many companies in the non conventional mortgage industry has been to add a spread for risk to the all in cost of securitizations to determine their discount rate 
from these experience comparisons  we have determined a spread  which is added to the all in cost of our mortgage loan securitization trusts investor certificates 
the discount rate considers our higher asset quality and performance of our securitized assets compared to industry asset quality and performance and the other characteristics of our securitized loans described below o underlying loan collateral with fixed yields  which are higher than others in the non conventional mortgage industry 
the average coupons of our securitized loans exceed the industry average by basis points or more 
all of our loans have fixed interest rates  which are more predictable than adjustable rate loans 
o most of our loans include prepayment fees 
approximately to of our business purpose loans have prepayment fees 
approximately to of our home equity loans have prepayment fees 
our experience indicates that prepayment fees increase the prepayment ramp periods and slow annual prepayment speeds  which have the effect of increasing the life of the loans securitized 
o a portfolio mix of first mortgage loans and second mortgage loans 
the high proportion of first mortgages results in lower delinquencies and losses 
o a portfolio credit grade mix comprised of a credits  b credits  c credits  and d credits 
in addition  our loss experience is below what is experienced by others in the non conventional mortgage industry 
the increase in the discount rate reflects the overall sustained increase in market interest rates experienced in fiscal including increases in the all in cost of the mortgage loan securitization trusts investor certificates  and increases in the costs of our funding 
the all in cost of the trusts investor certificates includes the highest trust certificate pass through interest rate in each mortgage securitization  trustee fees  and surety fees 
trustee fees and surety fees are deal specific and generally range from to basis points combined 
prior to fiscal year  our actual prepayment experience both quantitatively and qualitatively was not sufficient to conclude that the final actual experience expected would be materially different than the original prepayment assumptions used 
for each of the first three quarters of fiscal year  the net effect of the differences between the prepayment assumptions and the actual experience was not material 
because we were continuing to accumulate more complete and accurate statistics  and the impact of differences between the assumptions and actual experience was not material  no adjustments were made to the prepayment assumptions used in periodic evaluations of interest only strips through march  at june   assumptions for prepayments were adjusted based on actual historical experience 
the total effect of the changes in prepayment assumptions resulted in a favorable adjustment in the fair value of interest only strips of million 
the initial prepayment rate assumptions beginning with the mortgage loan securitization were changed to reflect a reduction in the annual prepayment rate assumption on business loans and an increase in the length of the prepayment ramp period for home equity loans 
the length of time before a pool of mortgage loans reaches its expected annual prepayment rate is referred to as the prepayment ramp period 
see year ended june  compared to year ended june  gain on sale of loans and leases for more information regarding the reasons for the change in initial prepayment assumptions 
the initial credit loss assumptions beginning with the mortgage loan securitization were increased as a result of an increase in the percentage of second mortgage loans included in current year securitizations and our concerns regarding the current high levels of real estate values 
as shown on the table above  summary of selected mortgage loan securitization trust information  the average percentage of first mortgage loans securitized declined approximately from fiscal to fiscal securitizations 
the current high real estate values affected our loss assumptions on recent securitizations because in the event of an economic downturn  the loan to value ratios of the recently originated loans could be understated 
both of these factors increase the potential that the underlying real estate collateral would not be sufficient to satisfy the loan if a foreclosure was required 
we believe these factors may limit our ability in recent securitizations to maintain the credit loss experience realized in prior securitizations 
actual credit loss experience for securitizations prior to the mortgage loan securitization continues to support the initial credit loss assumptions for those securitizations 
the following table provides information regarding the initial and current assumptions applied in determining the fair values of mortgage loan related interest only strips and servicing rights 
the assumptions for prepayment rates and credit loss rates are compared to actual experience on the table 
at the time of the sales  the initial assumptions for prepayment rates and credit loss rates were representative of expectations for the securitized portfolios performance

the business loan prepayment ramp begins at in month one 
the home equity loan prepayment ramp begins at in month one 
although we believe we have made reasonable estimates of prepayment rates and credit loss assumptions  the actual prepayment and credit loss experience may materially vary from our estimates 
to the extent that prepayments or credit losses differ materially from the estimates made  adjustments of our interest only strips and servicing rights may be required in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
levels of future prepayments and credit loss assumptions higher than those initially estimated could result in a reduction in the value of interest only strips and servicing rights which would adversely affect income in the period of adjustment 
additionally  some of our securitization trusts have issued floating rate certificates supported by fixed rate mortgages 
the fair value of the excess cash flow we will receive may be affected by any changes in the rates paid on the floating rate certificates 
lease securitizations 
information related to our two lease securitizations is presented in the table below 
as of december   we de emphasized the lease origination business but continue to service the remaining leases in our managed portfolio 
summary of selected lease securitization information current balances as of june  dollars in millions a a original balance of leases securitized current balance of leases securitized weighted average yield on leases securitized weighted average remaining term months on on leases securitized original balance of trust certificates current balance of trust certificates weighted average pass through interest rate to trust certificate holders overcollateralization requirements annual surety wrap fee valuation assumptions residual interests discount rate initial valuation current valuation servicing rights discount rate initial valuation current valuation prepayment rates a a credit loss rates annual credit loss rate initial assumption current assumption actual experience servicing fees contractual fees ancillary fees a the equipment leasing portfolio has experienced insignificant prepayments  less than annualized 
should a lease terminate early  any impact on the valuation of lease securitization assets would be recorded upon termination of the lease 
servicing rights 
when loans or leases are sold through a securitization  the servicing on the loans or leases is retained and we capitalize the benefit associated with the rights to service securitized loans and leases based on those servicing rights relative fair value to other consideration received in the securitization 
we receive annual contractual servicing fees of basis points which is paid out of accumulated mortgage loan payments before payments of principal and interest are made to trust certificate holders  prepayment fees  late charges  non sufficient funds fees and other fees which are retained directly by us as servicer as payments are collected from the borrowers 
fair value of servicing rights is determined by computing the present value of projected net cash flows from contractual servicing fees and ancillary servicing fees as described above  net of costs to service expected to be received over the life of the loans or leases securitized 
these projections incorporate assumptions  including prepayment rates  credit loss rates and discount rates 
these assumptions are similar to those used to value the interest only strips retained in a securitization 
periodically  capitalized servicing rights are evaluated for impairment  which is measured as the excess of unamortized cost over fair value 
interest rates are not considered as a predominant risk characteristic for purposes of evaluating impairment 
we have generally found that the non conforming mortgage market is less sensitive to changes in interest rates than the conventional mortgage market where borrowers have more favorable credit history for the following reasons 
first  there are relatively few lenders willing to supply credit to non conforming borrowers which limits those borrowers opportunity to refinance 
second  interest rates available to non conforming borrowers tend to adjust much slower than conventional mortgage rates which reduces the non conforming borrowers opportunity to capture economic value from refinancing 
also  a majority of loans to our borrowers require prepayment fees 
as a result  the prepayment experience on our managed portfolio is more stable than the mortgage market in general 
this stability favorably impacts our ability to value the future cash flows from our servicing rights and interest only strips because it increases the predictability of future cash flows 
as a result of adjustments to prepayment assumptions to reflect actual experience on earlier mortgage loan securitizations  a servicing rights write down of million was recorded in fiscal at june   servicing rights totaled million  compared to million at june  results of operations summary financial results dollars in thousands  except per share data year ended june  percentage change total revenues    total expenses    net income    return on average equity return on average assets earnings per share basic diluted dividends declared per share overview for fiscal  net income decreased million  or  to million from million for basic earnings per share decreased  to for year ended june   on average common shares of  compared to on average common shares of  for fiscal diluted earnings per share decreased  to for year ended june   on average common shares of  compared to on average common shares of  for fiscal increases in gain on sale of loans and leases  interest accretion on interest only strips and servicing income were offset by increases in expenses including a million write down of our interest only strips primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used to value the interest only strips from to

average common share and earnings per common share amounts for fiscal and prior have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effect of a stock dividend declared august  see note in the consolidated financial statements for further description 
dividends of per share were paid for year ended june  compared to dividends of per share for year ended june  in the first quarter of fiscal year  we increased our quarterly dividend by to per share and by an additional to per share in january the common dividend payout ratio based on diluted earnings per share was for year ended june  compared to for fiscal as previously reported  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
on january   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares  representing of the then outstanding shares 
our board of directors initiated the stock repurchase program in view of the price level of our common stock which was trading at that time at below book value and its consistent earnings growth over fiscal and  which did not result in a corresponding increase in the market value of our common stock 
in fiscal   shares were repurchased representing of the outstanding shares 
the impact of the share repurchase program was an increase of diluted earnings per share by approximately for the year ended june  our business strategy is dependent upon our ability to increase loan origination volume through both geographic expansion and growth in current markets to realize efficiencies in the infrastructure and loan production channels we have been building 
the implementation of this strategy will depend in large part on a variety of factors outside of our control  including  but not limited to  the ability to obtain adequate financing on favorable terms and profitably securitize loans on a regular basis and continue to expand in the face of increasing competition 
our failure with respect to any of these factors could impair our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
see risk factors if we are unable to continue to successfully implement our growth strategy  our revenues may decrease 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  total revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal growth in total revenues was the result of increases in gains on securitizations of mortgage loans  increases in interest accretion earned on our interest only strips  increases in interest and fees on loans originated  and increases in servicing income due to the growth of the total managed portfolio 
gain on sale of loans and leases 
gains of million were recorded on the securitization of billion of loans for fiscal this represented an increase of million  or  over gains of million recorded on securitizations of million of loans and leases for fiscal the following schedule details the volume of loan and lease securitizations during the fiscal years ended june   and in millions year ended june  securitizations business loans home equity loans equipment leases total  the increase in securitization gains for the year ended june  was primarily due to the higher volume of loans securitized as reflected in the table above 
the securitization gain as a percentage of mortgage loans securitized  for fiscal  was down slightly from on mortgage loans securitized for fiscal including less profitable lease securitizations in fiscal  the securitization gain percentage was for that year 
the decrease in the mortgage loan securitization gain percentage for fiscal was due to a reduction in the spread between the average pass through rate paid to investors  increases in the credit loss assumptions beginning with the mortgage loan securitization  an increase in the discount rate used in the mortgage loan securitization and the impact of the january  adoption of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise sfas no 

see securitization accounting considerations for more information on the calculation of securitization gains  the average coupons on loans securitized  pass through rates paid to investors and credit loss assumptions 
the impact of sfas no 
is discussed below 
these decreases in the gain percentage for fiscal were partially offset by a higher percentage of business loans securitized and a reduction in prepayment rate assumptions as discussed below 
the increase in the initial credit loss assumptions beginning with the mortgage loan securitization resulted from an increase in the percentage of second mortgage loans included in current year securitizations and our concerns regarding the current high levels of real estate values 
as shown on the table summary of selected mortgage loan securitization trust information in securitization accounting considerations the average percentage of first mortgage loans securitized declined approximately from fiscal to fiscal securitizations 
the current high real estate values affected our loss assumptions on recent securitizations because in the event of an economic downturn  the loan to value ratios of the recently originated loans could be understated 
both of these factors increase the potential that the underlying real estate collateral would not be sufficient to satisfy the loan if a foreclosure was required 
we believe these factors may limit our ability in recent securitizations to maintain the credit loss experience realized in prior securitizations 
actual credit loss experience for securitizations prior to the mortgage loan securitization continues to support the initial credit loss assumptions for those securitizations 
the unfavorable impacts of the reduction in spread for fiscal  increases in credit loss assumptions beginning with the mortgage loan securitization  and the impact sfas no 
were partially offset by the following factors o a higher percentage of business loans securitized 
for fiscal  business loans securitized  which have a higher coupon than home equity loans  represented of total loans and leases securitized  compared to of total loans and leases securitized for fiscal the higher percentage of business loans resulted in an increased value of the interest only strips generated from the pool of securitized loans 
o a reduction in the annual prepayment rate assumption on business loans and an increase in the length of the prepayment ramp period for home equity loans 
due to increases in the volume of loans originated with prepayment fees  we have reduced the annual prepayment rate assumption on business loans and lengthened the prepayment ramp period for home equity loans for mortgage loan securitizations beginning with the securitization 
reducing the annual prepayment assumption and lengthening the prepayment ramp period is supported by our experience with loans having prepayment fees  as discussed below  that fewer borrowers will prepay  and those prepaying will do so more slowly 
the percentage of home equity loans containing prepayment fees increased from less than of loans originated to over over the nine month period ending october  as a result of this increase in the percentage of loans originated having prepayment fees  we had lengthened the initial assumptions used for the prepayment ramp period on home equity loans from to months beginning with the mortgage loan securitization through the mortgage loan securitization and to months for the mortgage loan securitization 
this increase in the length of the prepayment ramp period for home equity loans was supported by actual cumulative prepayment experience through june   which demonstrated that only of home equity loans having prepayment fees were actually prepaid by the borrowers  while of home equity loans without prepayment fees were prepaid 
this cumulative historical performance demonstrates that it is nearly twice as likely that a loan without a prepayment fee will be prepaid 
see securitization accounting considerations for a comparison of the prepayment assumptions used in our valuation of interest only strips and servicing rights to actual historical experience 
sfas no 
requires that  after the securitization of a mortgage loan held for sale  an entity classify the resulting mortgage backed security or other retained interests based on its ability and intent to hold or sell those investments 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 as of january   we reclassified our interest only strips from trading securities to available for sale securities 
as available for sale securities  the difference on the date of securitization between the fair value of an interest only strip and its allocated cost is recorded in stockholders equity and reported as a component of comprehensive income 
fair value adjustments of million pre tax were recorded as a component of comprehensive income for fiscal in the first six months of fiscal  which was prior to the adoption of sfas no 
and the resulting reclassification from trading securities to available for sale securities  all differences on the date of securitization between fair value and allocated cost of interest only strips were recognized in securitization gains 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and  fair value differences were recognized as a component of comprehensive income 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial condition 
the following schedule details loan and lease originations during the fiscal years ended june   and in thousands year ended june  business purpose loans    home equity loans    equipment leases    loan originations for our subsidiary  american business credit  inc  which offers business purpose loans secured by real estate  increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was attributable to geographic expansion of american business credit s lending program as well as refocused marketing efforts 
in the third quarter of fiscal  american business credit launched a web site  www

interest and fee income 
interest and fee income for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal interest and fee income consists primarily of interest income earned on available for sale loans and leases  premiums earned on whole loan sales and other ancillary fees collected in connection with loan and lease originations 
interest income remained relatively consistent at million for fiscal from million for fiscal fee income increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in fee income for fiscal was the result of increases in the volume of loans originated during the period 
loan origination related fees which are mainly comprised of application fees and other fees collected in connection with the loan approval and closing process increased million or  for fiscal from fiscal mainly due to a increase in loan originations in fiscal from fiscal included in fee income are premiums earned on whole loan sales 
premiums on whole loan sales decreased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the decrease in premium income was due to a decline in the average premium earned on whole loan sales from in fiscal to in the current year  and a decrease in the volume of whole loan sales from million for fiscal  to million for fiscal interest accretion on interest only strips 
interest accretion represents the yield component of cash flows received on interest only strips 
interest accretion of million was recorded for fiscal and million was recorded for fiscal we currently use a prospective approach to estimate interest accretion 
periodically we update estimates of residual cash flow from our securitizations 
when it is probable that there is a favorable change in estimated residual cash flow from the cash flow previously projected  we recognize a greater percentage of estimated interest accretion earned by the securitization 
any probable unfavorable change in estimated residual cash flow would likewise decrease the percentage of estimated interest accretion earned by the securitization 
any change in value of the underlying interest only strip could impact our current estimate of residual cash flow earned from the securitizations 
for example  a significant change in market interest rates could increase or decrease the level of prepayments  thereby changing the size of the total managed loan portfolio and related projected cash flows 
see securitization accounting considerations for additional discussion 
our methodology and assumptions for each period since march  are further described below 
the increase in interest accretion was affected by two factors 
first  the increase reflects growth of million or in the average balance of interest only strips from million for fiscal to million for fiscal and growth in cash flow received from interest only strips 
second  cash flows received on interest only strips were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as of june   only one of our existing securitizations had satisfied its final target overcollateralization requirement and was generating residual cash flow 
as of june  five securitizations had met final overcollateralization requirements and as of june  nine securitizations had met final overcollateralization requirements 
meeting these final targets as well as the fact that our more recent securitizations were much larger resulted in a significant increase in cash flow to us from fiscal to the present 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  residual cash flows to us were limited due to the lack of maturity of the securitizations underlying our interest only strips 
as described above  as the securitizations matured  meaning that the final overcollateralization requirements were met  we received cash flow from a greater number of securitizations 
during the period prior to receiving significant cash flow from the securitizations  we recognized only a portion of the estimated interest accretion earned on our interest only strips 
this methodology reflected our uncertainty as to the timing and quantity of future residual cash flow 
our estimate of the amount of interest accretion to be recognized did not change until we received expected cash flow for a sustained period of time 
by the last quarter of fiscal  more experience with the securitization pools was acquired and on a gradual basis more securitizations were performing as expected in meeting their final targets 
at that time  we were realizing consistent cash flow and based on this historical experience  we recognized a greater percentage of the estimated interest accretion earned by the securitizations 
by the end of the first quarter of fiscal  as an even greater number of securitizations were meeting final targets  again  based on the sustained performance of the securitizations  we increased the percentage of estimated interest accretion recognized 
these increases reflected our increased certainty as to the amount of ongoing residual cash flow to be received from the securitization trusts 
throughout fiscal  the interest accretion recognized by quarter as a percentage of cash flow from the securitization trusts has remained stable 
servicing income 
servicing income is comprised of contractual and ancillary fees collected on securitized loans and leases less amortization of the servicing rights that are recorded at the time loans and leases are securitized 
ancillary fees include prepayment fees  late fees and other servicing compensation 
for fiscal  servicing income increased million  or  to million  from million for fiscal a servicing rights write down of million was recorded in fiscal to reflect the impact of adjustments to prepayment assumptions on earlier mortgage loan securitizations to reflect actual prepayment experience 
the following table summarizes the components of servicing income for the years ended june  and in millions year ended june  contractual and ancillary fees amortization of servicing rights servicing rights write down net servicing income as an annualized percentage of the average managed portfolio  servicing income before the fiscal servicing rights write down was compared to for the decrease resulted from a lower percentage of loans prepaying in fiscal in fiscal  prepayment fees collected as a percentage of the average managed portfolio were compared to for fiscal the origination of loans with prepayment fees impacts our servicing income in two ways 
prepayment fees reduce the likelihood of a borrower prepaying their loan 
this results in prolonging the length of time a loan is outstanding which increases the contractual servicing fees to be collected over the life of the loan 
additionally  the terms of our servicing agreements with the securitization trusts allow us to retain prepayment fees collected from borrowers as part of our compensation for servicing loans 
amortization of the servicing rights asset for securitized loans and leases is calculated individually for each securitization pool and is recognized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated future servicing income on that particular pool of loans or leases 
we perform a valuation analysis of servicing rights on a quarterly basis to determine the fair value of our servicing rights 
if our valuation analysis indicates the carrying value of servicing rights are not recoverable through future cash flows from contractual servicing and other ancillary fees  a valuation allowance or write down would be recorded 
to date  our valuation analysis has not indicated any impairment other than the million write down recorded in fiscal and no valuation allowance has been required 
impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value 
total expenses 
for fiscal  total expenses increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal as described in more detail below  this increase was a result of increased interest expense attributable to the sale of subordinated debt and borrowings used to fund loan and lease originations and increases in employee related costs  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses related to growth in loan originations  the growth of the total managed portfolio and the continued building of support area infrastructure and internet capabilities 
in addition a write down of our interest only strips of million was recorded primarily as a result of an increase from to in the discount rate used to value our interest only strips 
interest expense 
for the year ended june   interest expense increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase was attributable to an increase in the amount of subordinated debt outstanding during fiscal  the proceeds of which were used to fund loan originations  operating activities  repayments of maturing subordinated debt and investments in systems technology and internet capabilities required to position us for future growth 
average subordinated debt outstanding during fiscal was million compared to million during fiscal average interest rates paid on subordinated debt outstanding increased to during fiscal from during fiscal rates offered on subordinated debt increased in response to general increases in market rates and to attract funds with a longer average maturity 
the average outstanding balances under warehouse and other lines of credit were million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal in fiscal  we increased the utilization of proceeds from the sale of subordinated debt to fund loan originations thereby maintaining a comparable average warehouse line of credit balance while increasing loan originations 
borrowings under warehouse lines of credit are secured by mortgage loans and represent advances of cash to us  usually at of the principal amount of the mortgage loan used as collateral 
these borrowings are for a limited duration  generally no more than days  pending the ultimate sale of the mortgage loans through securitization or whole loan sale  either of which will generate the proceeds necessary to retire the borrowing 
provision for credit losses 
an allowance for credit losses for available for sale loans and leases is maintained primarily to account for loans and leases that are delinquent and are expected to be ineligible for sale into a future securitization 
the allowance is calculated based upon management s estimate of the expected collectibility of loans and leases outstanding based upon a variety of factors  including but not limited to  periodic analysis of available for sale loans and leases  economic conditions and trends  historical credit loss experience  borrowers ability to repay  and collateral considerations 
although we maintain an allowance for credit losses at the level we consider adequate to provide for potential losses  there can be no assurances that actual losses will not exceed the estimated amounts or that an additional provision will not be required 
the following table summarizes changes in the allowance for credit losses for the fiscal years ended june   and in thousands year ended june  balance at beginning of period acquired through acquisition provision for credit losses  charge offs  net of recoveries   balance at end of period  the following table summarizes net charge off experience by loan type for the fiscal years ended june   and in thousands years ended june  business purpose loans home equity loans equipment leases  total   the increase in charge offs for fiscal related to deterioration in our lease portfolio 
the increase in charge offs for fiscal related to the growth in the total managed portfolio  which increased from million as of june  to billion as of june   and to loans repurchased from our securitization trusts 
while we are under no obligation to do so  at times we elect to repurchase some foreclosed and delinquent loans from the securitization trusts 
under the terms of the securitization agreements  repurchases are permitted only for foreclosed and delinquent loans and the purchase prices are at the loans outstanding contractual balance 
under the terms of the trust agreements  a foreclosed loan is one where we as servicer have initiated formal foreclosure proceedings against the borrower and a delinquent loan is one that is days or more past due 
the foreclosed and delinquent loans we typically elect to repurchase must be days or more delinquent and are the subject of completed foreclosure proceedings  or where a completed foreclosure action is imminent 
we elect to repurchase loans in situations requiring more flexibility for the administration and collection of these loans in order to maximize their economic recovery and to avoid temporary discontinuations of residual or stepdown overcollateralization cash flows from securitization trusts 
the related charge offs on these repurchased loans are included in our provision for credit losses in the period of charge off 
our ability to repurchase these loans does not disqualify us for sales accounting under sfas no 
and other relevant accounting literature because we are not required to repurchase any loan and our ability to repurchase a loan is limited 
the following table summarizes the principal balances of loans we have repurchased from the mortgage loan securitization trusts for the three years ended june   and all loans were repurchased at the contractual outstanding balances at the time of repurchase

for fiscal  employee related costs increased million  to million  from million for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of staff in the marketing  loan servicing and other business support areas to support the growth in loan originations and total managed portfolio 
the number of employees was at june  and at june  sales and marketing expenses 
for fiscal  sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal expenses for direct mail advertising increased million  or  for fiscal compared to the prior year due to increased use of targeted direct mail programs for our loan products 
these targeted programs are considered to be more cost effective than the television and radio advertising campaigns utilized into the second quarter of fiscal television and radio advertising costs decreased by million  or  for fiscal compared to the prior year 
in addition  we increased the use of newspaper and periodical advertising by million to generate additional sales of our loan products and subordinated debt securities 
the remaining increase in sales and marketing expense was due to increased expenditures on various internet and short term telemarketing programs undertaken by the loan origination operations and expenditures for various corporate communications and initiatives 
subject to market conditions  we plan to selectively increase the funding for advertising in markets where we believe we can generate significant additional increases in loan originations and sales of subordinated debt securities 
general and administrative expenses 
for fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increases in rent  telephone  office supplies and equipment  expenses associated with real estate owned  professional fees  investments in systems and technology and other expenses incurred as a result of the previously discussed growth in loan originations  the volume of total loans and leases managed during fiscal and the continued building of support area infrastructure and internet capabilities 
interest only strips fair value adjustment 
in fiscal  a write down of million was recorded on our interest only strips 
the write down included a charge of million related to an increase from to in the discount rate used to value our interest only strips 
this change in the discount rate was considered a permanent fair value adjustment and was recorded as expense in fiscal the write down also included a charge of million for the impact of changes in one month libor deemed to be permanent 
a portion of the certificates issued to investors by securitization trusts have floating interest rates based on one month libor plus a spread 
the fair value of the excess cash flow we will receive from these trusts would be affected by any changes in rates paid on the floating rate certificates 
the write down included a credit of million for the net impact of adjustments made to the prepayment assumptions on mortgage loan securitizations at june  the fair value of our interest only strips at june  was million

see interest rate risk management interest only strips and servicing rights for a discussion of the impact of one month libor 
provision for income taxes 
in fiscal  our effective tax rate increased to from in fiscal due to increased state tax liabilities 
as a result of our geographic expansion  we have increased the number of states we are now doing significant business in and have increased our tax provision for additional tax liabilities in certain states 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  total revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increases in gains on sale of loans and leases through securitizations  increases in interest accretion on interest only strips and servicing income 
gain on sale of loans and leases 
for fiscal  gains of million were recorded on the securitization of million of loans and leases 
this is an increase of million  or  over gains of million recorded on securitizations of million of loans and leases for fiscal the increase in securitization gains for fiscal was primarily due to the higher volume of loans securitized 
the securitization gain as a percentage of mortgage loans securitized  for fiscal  was down from on mortgage loans securitized for fiscal including leases securitized  the gain percentages on loans and leases securitized for the fiscal years ended june  and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the gain percentage on mortgage loans securitized for fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in the spread between the average coupon on loans securitized and the pass through rate paid to investors  a lower percentage of business loans securitized for fiscal  and the impact of the january  adoption of sfas no 
for fiscal  business loans securitized  which have a higher coupon than home equity loans  represented of total loans securitized  compared to of total loans securitized for fiscal the lower percentage of business loans securitized resulted in a reduced value of the interest only strips generated from the pool of securitized loans 
see securitization accounting considerations for more detail on average coupons on loans securitized and pass through rates paid to investors 
the impact of sfas no 
is discussed below 
the unfavorable impacts of the reduction in spread for fiscal  a lower percentage of business loans securitized for fiscal  and the impact of sfas no 
were partially offset by a reduction in the annual prepayment rate assumption on business loans and an increase in the length of the prepayment ramp period for home equity loans 
due to increases in the volume of loans originated with prepayment fees  we have reduced the annual prepayment rate assumption on business loans and lengthened the prepayment ramp period for home equity loans for mortgage loan securitizations beginning with the securitization 
see year ended june  compared to year ended june  for further explanation of the reduction in the annual prepayment rate assumption on business loans and the increase in the length of the prepayment ramp period for home equity loans 
sfas no 
requires that  after the securitization of a mortgage loan held for sale  an entity classify the resulting mortgage backed security or other retained interests based on its ability and intent to hold or sell those investments 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 as of january   we reclassified our interest only strips from trading securities to available for sale securities 
as available for sale securities  the difference on the date of securitization between the fair value of an interest only strip and its allocated cost is recorded in stockholders equity and reported as a component of comprehensive income 
fair value adjustments of million pre tax were recorded as a component of comprehensive income in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal in fiscal  which was prior to the adoption of sfas no 
and the resulting reclassification from trading securities to available for sale securities  all differences on the date of securitization between fair value and allocated cost of interest only strips were recognized in securitization gains 
interest and fee income 
interest and fee income was million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or from fiscal interest and fee income consists primarily of income earned on available for sale loans and leases  premiums earned on whole loan sales and other ancillary fees collected in connection with loan and lease originations 
interest income decreased million  or  to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the duration of time available for sale loans accrued interest income prior to securitization and a reduction in the average coupon earned on loans and leases originated  from in fiscal to in fiscal the decline in the average coupon in fiscal primarily resulted from competitive pricing in the home equity lending market 
fee income increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in fee income was due to an increase in ancillary fees earned in connection with increased originations 
an increase in loan and lease origination related fees  which are primarily comprised of application fees and other fees collected in connection with the loan and lease approval and closing process  of million was partially offset by a decrease in premiums on whole loan sales 
premiums on whole loan sales decreased to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for fiscal year ended june  the decrease in premiums on whole loan sales for fiscal was due to a decrease in the average premium earned on whole loan sales 
for fiscal  the average premium earned on whole loan sales was compared to in fiscal the decrease was due to general market corrections in the whole loan sale market where purchasers of whole loans were no longer willing to pay the level of premiums previously earned 
the decrease in the average premium earned was partially offset by a increase in the volume of whole loan sales in fiscal to million from million during fiscal interest accretion on interest only strips 
interest accretion represents the interest component of cash flows received on interest only strips 
interest accretion of million was recorded for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in interest accretion reflects the growth in the average balance of interest only strips of  or million for the year ending june  from million for the year ending june  and growth in cash flow received on interest only strips 
cash flows received on interest only strips were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal because of the cash flow performance of the interest only strips  we began to recognize greater amounts of accretion in the fourth quarter of fiscal see year ended june  compared to year ended june  for further explanation of the increase in the amounts of accretion recognized in fiscal servicing income 
servicing income is comprised of contractual and ancillary fees collected on securitized loans and leases  less amortization of the servicing rights recorded at the time the loans and leases are securitized 
servicing income increased million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal this increase resulted from the higher average total managed portfolio  which was million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of the average managed portfolio  servicing income increased to for fiscal  from for fiscal  as a result of the increase in the origination of loans with prepayment fees and the collection of other ancillary fees 
the origination of loans with prepayment fees increases our servicing income in two ways 
prepayment fees reduce the likelihood of borrowers prepaying their loans 
this results in prolonging the period these loans are outstanding which increases the contractual servicing fees collected over the life of the loans 
additionally  the terms of our servicing agreements with securitization trusts allow us to retain prepayment fees collected from borrowers as part of our compensation for servicing loans 
as a result  if a borrower does prepay a loan  we are compensated for the loss of the remaining contractual servicing fees that would have been collected over the remaining term of the loan by receiving a lump sum fee at the time the prepayment occurs 
total expenses 
total expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal as described in more detail below  this increase was primarily a result of higher interest expense attributable to sales of subordinated debt securities and borrowings used to fund loan and lease originations and increases in sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
these increases related to the growth in loan and lease originations  the growth in the total managed portfolio and the continued building of support area infrastructure to support the increases in originated and managed portfolios 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was attributable to an increase in the amount of subordinated debt outstanding during fiscal  the proceeds of which were used to fund operating activities  repayments of maturing subordinated debt and investments in operations required to position us for future growth  and the interest costs related to greater utilization of warehouse and credit line facilities to fund loan and lease originations 
average subordinated debt outstanding during fiscal was million compared to million during fiscal average interest rates paid on outstanding subordinated debt increased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to increases in the rates offered on subordinated debt in order to respond to general increases in market rates and to attract additional funds 
the average outstanding balances under warehouse and other credit lines were million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses for fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal an allowance for credit losses for available for sale loans and leases is maintained primarily to account for loans and leases that are delinquent and are expected to be ineligible for sale into a future securitization

under the terms of the securitization agreements  repurchases are permitted only for foreclosed and delinquent loans and the purchase prices are at the loans outstanding contractual balance 
we elect to repurchase loans in situations requiring more flexibility for the administration and collection of these loans in order to maximize their economic recovery and to avoid temporary discontinuations of residual or stepdown overcollateralization cash flows from securitization trusts 
the related charge offs on these repurchased loans are included in our provision for credit losses in the period of charge off 
employee related costs 
employee related costs increased million  or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of additions to staff in support of the increased marketing efforts  loan and lease originations and servicing activities

management anticipates that these expenses will continue to increase in the future as our expansion continues and loan and lease originations continue to increase 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increases were primarily attributable to targeted television and radio advertising related to home equity loans and advertising costs resulting from increased newspaper and direct mail advertising related to sales of subordinated debt and loan products 
during fiscal  targeted television advertising was intensified in chicago  florida and georgia

as a result  it is anticipated that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in the future 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increases in rent  telephone  office expenses  professional fees and other expenses incurred as a result of previously discussed increases in loan and lease originations and in the volume of total loans and leases managed during fiscal and the continued building of support area infrastructure to support the increases in originations and the total managed portfolio

accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million  or  to million at june  primarily due to an increase in accrued interest payable on subordinated debt 
june  compared to june  total assets increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  due primarily to increases in interest only strips and other receivables  cash and cash equivalents and servicing rights 
cash and cash equivalents increased million  or to million at june  from million at june  primarily due to receipts from sales of subordinated debt securities 
interest only strips increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  during fiscal  million in loan and lease securitizations were completed 
a detailed analysis of the account activity for fiscal is presented above 
servicing rights increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  due primarily to the recording of million of servicing rights obtained in connection with loan and lease securitizations  partially offset by amortization of servicing rights 
loan and lease receivables available for sale decreased million  or  at june   primarily due to the timing and size of fourth quarter fiscal securitizations 
mortgage loans securitized in the fourth quarter of fiscal were million compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal total liabilities increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  due primarily to increases in subordinated debt and warehouse lines and other notes payable 
the increase in subordinated debt of million  or  was primarily attributable to net sales of subordinated debt securities 
additional borrowings of million  net of repayments  were obtained under warehouse and line of credit facilities to fund lending and leasing activities 
see liquidity and capital resources for further detail 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  due to growth in lending and leasing activities resulting in larger accruals for interest expense and other operating expenses 
deferred income taxes increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  due to timing differences in recognition of income from securitizations

see risk factors lending to credit impaired borrowers may result in higher delinquencies in our managed portfolio which could result in a reduction in profits for a discussion of risks associated with increases in delinquencies 
real estate owned total real estate owned  comprised of foreclosed properties and deeds acquired in lieu of foreclosure  increased to million  or of the total managed portfolio at june  compared to million  or and million  or at june  and  respectively 
the increase in the volume of real estate owned reflects the seasoning of the managed portfolio and the results of loss mitigation initiatives of quick repossession of collateral through accelerated foreclosure processes and cash for keys programs 
cash for keys is a program utilized in select situations 
when collateral values of loans support the action  a delinquent borrower may be offered a monetary payment in exchange for the deed to a property held as collateral for a loan 
this process eliminates the need to initiate a formal foreclosure process  which could take many months 
included in total real estate owned at june  was million recorded in our financial statements  and million in loan securitization trusts 
property acquired by foreclosure or in settlement of loan and lease receivables is recorded in our financial statements at the lower of the cost basis in the loan or fair value of the property less estimated costs to sell 
loss experience during fiscal  we experienced net loan and lease charge offs in our total managed portfolio of million 
net loan charge offs for fiscal represent of the average total managed portfolio 
loss severity experience on delinquent loans generally has ranged from to of principal and loss severity experience on real estate owned generally has ranged from to of principal 
the business purpose loans we originate have average loan to value ratios of 
the home equity loans we originate have average loan to value ratios of and the predominant share of our home mortgage products are first liens as opposed to junior lien loans 
we believe these factors may mitigate some potential losses on our managed portfolio 
interest rate risk management a primary market risk exposure that we face is interest rate risk 
profitability and financial performance is sensitive to changes in us treasury yields  libor yields and the spread between the effective rate of interest received on loans and leases available for sale or securitized generally fixed interest rates and the interest rates paid pursuant to credit facilities or the pass through rate to investors for interests issued in connection with securitizations 
a substantial and sustained increase in market interest rates could adversely affect our ability to originate and purchase loans 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management strategy is to mitigate the effects of changing interest rates on profitability and the fair value of interest rate sensitive balances primarily loans and leases available for sale  interest only strips  servicing rights and subordinated debt 
due to increases in market interest rates  we expect our ability to originate loans at rates that will maintain our current level of profitability will become more difficult than during a stable or falling interest rate environment 
we are addressing this challenge by carefully monitoring our product pricing  the actions of our competition and market trends in order to continue to originate loans in as profitable a manner as possible 
the higher rate environment could also unfavorably impact our liquidity and capital resources 
higher interest rates could impact our short term liquidity by widening investor spread requirements in pricing future securitizations  increasing the levels of overcollateralization in future securitizations  limiting our access to borrowings in the capital markets and limiting our ability to sell our subordinated debt securities at favorable interest rates 
in a rising interest rate environment  short term and long term liquidity could also be impacted by increased interest costs on all sources of borrowed funds  including the subordinated debt  and by reducing spreads on our securitized loans  which would reduce our cash flows 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of both long and short term liquidity and risk factors if we are not able to sustain the levels of growth in revenues and earnings that we experienced in the past  our future profits may be reduced 
interest rate sensitivity 
the following table provides information about financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for interest only strips and servicing rights  the table presents projected principal cash flows utilizing certain assumptions including prepayment and default rates 
see securitization accounting considerations for more information on these assumptions 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by expected maturity dates dollars in thousands amount maturing after june  there fair after total value rate sensitive assets loans and leases available for sale a     interest only strips         servicing rights         investments held to maturity investments available for sale rate sensitive liabilities fixed interest rate borrowings         average interest rate variable interest rate borrowings 
      average interest rate a for purposes of this table  all loans and leases which qualify for securitization are reflected as maturing within twelve months because all loans and leases available for sale are generally held for less than three months prior to securitization 
loans and leases available for sale 
gain on sale of loans may be unfavorably impacted to the extent fixed rate available for sale mortgage loans are held prior to securitization 
a significant variable affecting the gain on sale of loans in a securitization is the spread between the average coupon rate on fixed rate loans and the weighted average pass through rate to investors for interests issued in connection with the securitization 
although the average loan coupon rate is fixed at the time the loan is originated  the pass through rate to investors is not fixed until the pricing of the securitization which occurs just prior to the sale of the loans 
therefore  if market rates required by investors increase prior to securitization of the loans  the spread between the average coupon rate on the loans and the pass through rate to investors may be reduced or eliminated  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we estimate that each reduction in the spread reduces the gain on sale of loans as a percentage of loans securitized by approximately 
hedging strategies may be utilized in an attempt to mitigate the effect of changes in interest rates between the date rate commitments on loans are made and the date the fixed rate pass through certificates to be issued by a securitization trust are priced  a period typically less than days 
these strategies include the utilization of derivative financial instruments such as futures and forward pricing on securitizations 
the nature and quality of hedging transactions are determined based on various factors  including market conditions and the expected volume of mortgage loan and lease originations and purchases 
at the time the contract is executed  derivative contracts are specifically designated as hedges of mortgage loans  loan commitments or of our residual interests in mortgage loans in our conduit facility to be included in the next subsequent securitization 
the mortgage loans  loan commitments and the mortgage loans underlying our residual interests in the conduit facility consist of essentially similar pools of fixed rate loans and loan commitments  collateralized by real estate primarily residential real estate with similar maturities and similar credit characteristics 
fixed rate pass through certificates issued by securitization trusts are generally priced to yield a spread above a benchmark rate based on us treasury securities with a three year maturity 
the us treasury department has embarked on a repurchase program as a result of budget surpluses resulting in less liquidity in the treasury market 
as a result the asset backed security market is moving toward pricing that is based on the eurodollar and the interest rate swap markets 
therefore  we have incorporated eurodollar futures into our hedging program 
we hedge potential rate changes in treasury securities and eurodollars with futures contracts on similar underlying securities 
this has provided strong correlation between our hedge contracts and the ultimate pricing we have received on the subsequent securitization 
the gain or loss derived from these hedging transactions is deferred  reported in other assets or other liabilities and recognized as an adjustment to the gains on sale of loans when the loans are securitized 
cash flow related to hedging activities is reported as it occurs 
gains or losses on terminated contracts are recognized in the period the termination occurs 
the effectiveness of our hedges are continuously monitored 
if correlation did not exist  the related gain or loss on the contract would be recognized as an adjustment to income in the period incurred 
during fiscal  net cash losses of million were realized on hedging transactions futures contracts and were recognized as a component of gains on sale recorded on securitizations during the year 
during fiscal  net losses of approximately million were realized on hedging transactions futures contracts and were recognized as reductions to the gains on sale for the securitizations during the year 
the following schedule details outstanding hedge positions at june  there were no outstanding hedge positions at june  in thousands eurodollar forward futures treasury contracts sales total loans available for sale notional amount   unrealized losses mortgage conduit facility assets notional amount    unrealized losses loan commitments notional amount    unrealized losses total notional amount    unrealized losses if market interest rates decreased by basis points  the above hedge positions would result in a loss of approximately million 
while treasury rates  eurodollar rates and the pass through rate of securitizations are generally strongly correlated  this correlation has not held in periods of financial market disruptions eg the so called russian crisis in the later part of 
in addition to the above open hedge positions at june   we were obligated to satisfy a mortgage securitization prefund requirement of million which was satisfied in july in the future  we may expand the types of derivative financial instruments we use to hedge interest rate risk to include interest rate swaps or other types of futures contracts 
we may use hedging in an attempt to mitigate the effect of changes in market value of fixed rate mortgage loans held for sale 
however  an effective interest rate risk management strategy is complex and no such strategy can completely insulate us from interest rate changes 
poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions may increase rather than mitigate risk 
in addition  hedging involves transaction and other costs 
such costs could increase as the period covered by the hedging protection increases 
it is expected that such loss would be offset by income realized from securitizations in that period or in future periods 
as a result  we may be prevented from effectively hedging fixed rate loans held for sale  without reducing income in current or future periods due to the costs associated with hedging activities 
interest only strips and servicing rights 
a portion of the certificates issued to investors by securitization trusts are floating interest rate certificates based on one month libor plus a spread 
the fair value of the excess cash flow we will receive from these trusts would be affected by any changes in rates paid on the floating rate certificates 
at june   million of debt issued by loan securitization trusts was floating rate debt based on libor  representing of total debt issued by mortgage loan securitization trusts 
for fiscal increases in one month libor resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our interest only strips of million 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the temporary changes in fair value were recognized as part of net adjustments to other comprehensive income  which is a component of retained earnings 
of the total million impact of the change in libor  million was deemed to be a permanent change in fair value and has been recognized as a write down through the statement of income during fiscal it is estimated that a increase in one month libor would decrease the fair value of interest only strips by approximately million 
a significant change in market interest rates could increase or decrease the level of loan prepayments  thereby changing the size of the total managed loan portfolio and the related projected cash flows 
higher than anticipated rates of loan prepayments could require a write down of the fair value of related interest only strips and servicing rights  adversely impacting earnings during the period of adjustment 
revaluations of our interest only strips and servicing rights are periodically performed 
as part of the revaluation process  assumptions used for prepayment rates are monitored against actual experience and adjusted if warranted 
it is estimated that a basis point increase in prepayment rates for example  from to on home equity loans and from to on business loans would decrease the fair value of interest only strips by approximately million and the fair value of servicing rights by approximately million 
see securitization accounting considerations for further information regarding these assumptions 
we attempt to minimize prepayment risk on interest only strips and servicing rights by requiring prepayment fees on business purpose loans and home equity loans  where permitted by law 
currently  approximately of business purpose loans and of home equity loans in the managed portfolio are subject to prepayment fees 
subordinated debt 
we also experience interest rate risk to the extent that as of june  approximately million of our liabilities were comprised of fixed rate subordinated debt with scheduled maturities of greater than one year 
to the extent that market interest rates demanded for subordinated debt increase in the future  the rates paid on replacement debt could exceed rates currently paid thereby increasing interest expense and reducing net income 
liquidity and capital resources because we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations  our business requires continual access to short and long term sources of debt to generate the cash required to fund our operations 
our cash requirements include funding loan originations and capital expenditures  repaying existing subordinated debt  paying interest expense and operating expenses  and  in connection with our securitizations  funding overcollateralization requirements and servicer obligations 
at times  we have used cash to repurchase our common stock and could in the future use cash for unspecified acquisitions of related businesses or assets 
borrowings against warehouse and credit facilities provide the primary funding source for loan originations 
these borrowings represent cash advanced to us for a limited duration  generally no more than days  and are secured by the loans 
the ultimate sale of the loans through securitization or whole loan sale generates the cash proceeds necessary to repay the borrowings under these facilities 
see credit facilities below for a more detailed description on these facilities 
cash flow from operations and the issuance of subordinated debt fund our remaining cash requirements discussed above 
we rely significantly on our ability to issue subordinated debt to meet these requirements since our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to meet these requirements 
our cash requirements include the obligation to repay maturing subordinated debt 
in the process of growing our businesses over the last three years  we have issued subordinated debt to partially fund that growth and to partially fund maturities of subordinated debt 
we expect that our historical levels of negative cash flow from operations will decline in the future and then become positive as the rate of increase in our operating cash expenditures begins to level  then decline due to an expected decrease in the rate of growth in loan production and as we realize efficiencies in the infrastructure and loan production channels we have been building and as the cash flows from our interest only strips increase 
the cash balances that we have built over the last two years are sufficient to cover approximately of the million of subordinated debt maturities due within one year 
cash balances have increased from million at june   to million at june  and million at june  we continue to significantly rely on access to the asset backed securities market through securitizations to generate cash proceeds for the repayment of borrowings under warehouse and credit facilities and to create our interest only strips and servicing rights which will provide future cash flows 
it is our expectation that future cash flows from our interest only strips and servicing rights will generate more of the cash flows required to meet maturities of our subordinated debt 
a significant portion of our loan originations are non conforming mortgages to subprime borrowers 
some participants in the non conforming mortgage industry have experienced greater than anticipated losses on their securitization interest only strips and servicing rights due to the effects of increased delinquencies  increased credit losses and increased prepayment rates  resulting in some competitors exiting the business or recording valuation allowances or write downs for these conditions 
as a result  some participants experienced restricted access to capital required to fund loan originations  and have been precluded from participation in the asset backed securitization market 
however  we have maintained our ability to obtain funding and to securitize loans 
factors that have minimized the effect of adverse market conditions on our business include our ability to originate loans through established retail channels  focus on credit underwriting  assess prepayment fees on loans  diversify lending in the home equity and business loan markets and raise capital through sales of subordinated debt securities pursuant to a registered public offering 
subject to economic  market and interest rate conditions  we intend to continue to transact additional securitizations for future loan originations 
any delay or impairment in our ability to securitize loans  as a result of market conditions or otherwise  could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
additionally  we act as the servicer of the loans and leases securitized and in that capacity will be obligated to advance funds in some circumstances which may create greater demands on our cash flow than either selling loans with servicing released or maintaining a portfolio of loans and leases 
when borrowers are delinquent in making monthly payments on mortgage loans included in a securitization trust  we are required to advance interest for the delinquent loans if we deem that the advances will be ultimately recoverable 
these advances require funding from our capital resources  but have priority of repayment from the succeeding month s mortgage loan payments 
to a limited extent  we intend to continue to augment the interest and fee income earned on loans and leases by selling loans and leases in whole loan sales to unrelated third parties 
these transactions also create additional liquid funds available for lending activities 
subordinated debt securities 
during fiscal  we sold million in principal amount of subordinated debt securities  net of redemptions  with maturities ranging between one day and ten years 
as of june   million of subordinated debt was outstanding 
under a shelf registration statement declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on october   we registered million of subordinated debt  of which million was available for future issuance at june  the proceeds from sales of subordinated debt securities will be used to fund general operating and lending activities and maturities of subordinated debt 
we intend to meet our obligation to repay such debt as it matures with cash flow from operations  cash flows from interest only strips  and cash generated from additional debt financing 
the utilization of funds for the repayment of such obligations should not adversely affect operations 
credit facilities 
the following is a description of the warehouse and line of credit facilities that are utilized to fund origination of loans and our operations 
all of our balance sheet facilities are senior in right of payment to the subordinated debt 
the warehouse revolving lines of credit are secured by loan and lease receivables 
the other credit facilities are secured with interest only strips or other assets 
the warehouse credit agreements require that we maintain specific covenants regarding net worth  leverage and other standards 
at june   we were in compliance with the terms of all loan covenants 
amount amount amount utilized on utilized off committed balance sheet balance sheet warehouse revolving line of credit  expiring august   warehouse revolving line of credit  expiring october   warehouse revolving line of credit  december   total warehouse facilities    revolving line of credit  expiring december   repurchase agreement   total revolving credit facilities    other credit facilities and notes payable commercial paper conduit for lease production  maturity matches underlying leases    other debt total credit facilities    at june   our subsidiaries had an aggregate million available under interim warehouse and security agreements with prudential securities credit corporation expiring august  in september  the agreement with prudential was increased to million and its expiration date was extended to september the obligations described in these agreements are guaranteed by us 
under these agreements  the subsidiaries may fund loan originations by obtaining advances subject to specific conditions  which bear interest at a specified margin over the libor rate 
the obligations described in these agreements are collateralized by pledged loans 
in march of  these agreements were amended to provide for the sale of loans into an off balance sheet conduit facility 
the combination of on balance sheet borrowings against the warehouse facility to fund loan originations and the amount of loans sold into the off balance sheet conduit facility at any point in time was limited to million at june   million beginning september the sale into the off balance sheet conduit facility involves a two step transfer that qualifies for sale accounting under sfas no 
first we sell the loans to a special purpose entity which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the loans 
next the special purpose entity sells the loans to a qualified special purpose entity the facility for cash proceeds generated by its sale of notes to a third party purchaser 
we have no obligation to repurchase the loans and neither the third party note purchaser nor the facility has a right to require such repurchase 
the facility has the option to re securitize the loans  ordinarily using longer term certificates 
if the loans are not re securitized by the facility  the third party note purchaser has the right to securitize or sell the loans 
under this arrangement  the loans have been isolated from us and our subsidiaries  and  as a result  the transfer to the conduit facility is treated as a sale for financial reporting purposes 
during fiscal  we sold approximately million in principal amount of loans to the conduit facility and recognized gains on those sales totaling approximately million 
in june  million of loans in the conduit facility were re securitized by the facility 
at june  there were million in principal amount of loans in the conduit facility and an additional million in the on balance sheet facility 
subsequent to june   we and our subsidiaries  american business credit  homeamerican credit and new jersey mortgage  established a million facility which provides for the sale of loans into an off balance sheet funding facility with ubs principal finance  llc  an affiliate of ubs warburg 
the sale into the off balance sheet conduit facility involves a two step transfer that qualifies for sale accounting under sfas no 
first  we sell the loans to a special purpose entity which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the loans 
next  the special purpose entity sells the loans to a qualified special purpose entity the facility for cash proceeds generated by its sale of notes to a third party purchaser 
we have no obligation to repurchase the loans  except under certain conditions where loans do not conform to representations and warranties made by us at the time of sale  and neither the third party note purchaser nor the sponsor has a right to require such repurchase 
the facility has the option to re securitize the loans  ordinarily using longer term certificates 
if the facility fails to re securitize the loans within a specified period  the third party note purchaser has the right to securitize or sell the loans 
under this arrangement  the loans have been isolated from us and our subsidiaries  and  as a result  transfers to the conduit facility will be treated as sales for financial reporting purposes 
along with certain of our subsidiaries  we obtained a million warehouse credit facility from a syndicate of banks led by chase bank of texas na  expiring october  under this warehouse facility  advances may be obtained  subject to specific conditions described in the agreement  including sublimits based upon the type of collateral securing the advance 
interest rates on the advances are based upon day libor plus a margin 
obligations under the facility are collateralized by specified pledged loans and other related collateral 
the facility also requires us to meet specified financial ratios and contains restrictive covenants  including covenants limiting loans to and transaction with affiliates  the issuance of additional debt  and the types of investments that can be purchased 
at june   million of this facility was drawn upon 
given the increase in the prudential facility from million to million and the new million facility from ubs warburg  we intend to allow the chase facility to expire or be renewed at a reduced amount 
our subsidiaries  american business credit  homeamerican credit and new jersey mortgage obtained a million warehouse line of credit facility from residential funding corporation which expires december  under this warehouse facility  advances may be obtained  subject to specific conditions described in the agreement 
interest rates on the advances are based on libor plus a margin 
the obligations under this agreement are collateralized by pledged loans 
at june   million of this facility was drawn upon 
along with our subsidiaries  american business credit  homeamerican credit and new jersey mortgage  we obtained a million line of credit from chase bank expiring december interest rates on advances under the line are at libor plus a margin 
at june   million of this line of credit was being utilized 
the commercial paper conduit for lease production provided for sale of equipment leases using a pooled securitization 
after january  the facility was no longer available for sales of equipment leases 
the facility permitted us to sell leases in a two step transfer that qualified for sale accounting under sfas no 
first  we sold the leases to a special purpose entity which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the leases 
next  the special purpose entity sold the leases to a qualified special purpose entity the facility for cash 
the facility is sponsored by a major financial institution which has the option to re securitize the leases  ordinarily using longer term certificates 
should a longer term securitization not occur  the leases would remain in the commercial paper conduit until their contractual termination 
we have no obligation to repurchase the leases and neither the facility nor the sponsor has a right to require such repurchase 
at june   there was million of equipment leases in the commercial paper conduit facility representing the remaining balance of leases sold into the facility and accounted for as sales prior to the time we ceased originating equipment leases 
the company ceased originating equipment leases as of december  and no longer sells leases into this facility 
the final two transfers of leases into this facility with a remaining amount of million were accounted for as financing transactions 
the leases transferred in those final transfers were retained on our balance sheet and the financing raised by the commercial paper conduit facility was recorded as debt on the balance sheet 
as of june   million of debt was scheduled to mature during the next twelve months which was mainly comprised of maturing subordinated debt and warehouse lines of credit 
we currently expect to refinance the maturing debt through extensions of maturing debt or new debt financing and  if necessary  may retire the debt through cash flow from operations and loan sales or securitizations 
despite the current use of securitizations to fund loan growth  we are also dependent upon other borrowings to fund a portion of our operations 
we intend to continue to utilize debt financing to fund operations in the future 
a failure to renew or obtain adequate funding under a warehouse credit facility  or other borrowings  or any substantial reduction in the size or pricing in the markets for loans  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
to the extent we are not successful in maintaining or replacing existing financing  we may have to curtail loan production activities or sell loans rather than securitize them  thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we lease our corporate headquarters facilities under a five year operating lease expiring in july at a minimum annual base rent of approximately million 
we also lease a facility in roseland  new jersey under two operating leases  with the primary lease expiring in july and a sub lease expiring in january  at an annual base rent of million 
the primary roseland lease has a renewal provision at an increased annual rental 
in addition  branch offices are leased on a short term basis in various cities throughout the united states 
the leases for the branch offices are not material to operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding lease payments 
recent accounting pronouncements set forth below are recent accounting pronouncements which may have a future effect on operations 
these pronouncements should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies  which have been adopted  that are set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if specific conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction cash flow hedge  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
at the time of issuance sfas no 
was to be effective on a prospective basis for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  subsequently  the effective date of the standard was delayed until years beginning after june  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations
