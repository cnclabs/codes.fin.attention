provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan loss expense is based upon credit loss experience and on estimation of losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses for was million compared to million for over the last few years  through several strategic acquisitions and internal restructuring initiatives  sovereign has diversified its lending efforts and increased its emphasis on providing its customers with small business loans and an expanded line of commercial and consumer products  such as asset based lending and automobile loans 
as a result of the increased risk inherent in these loan products  and as sovereign continues to place emphasis on commercial and consumer lending in future years  management will regularly evaluate its loan portfolio and record additional loan loss allowance as is necessary 
historically  sovereign s additions to its loan loss allowance through income statement charges and acquisition accounting have been sufficient to absorb the incremental credit risk in its loan portfolio 
during  sovereign established an initial loan loss allowance of million related to million of loans acquired in connection with its corestates branch acquisition 
excluding charge offs of million incurred as part of an accelerated disposition of non performing residential loans during the second and fourth quarters of  as shown in table on the next page  the loan loss provision is in excess of net charge offs

for  acquired allowance and other additions represent million of loan loss allowance established as part of the fleet auto acquisition  partially off set by net charge offs of million related to first state for the three month period ended december  resulting from the differing fiscal year end of first state 
sovereign s policy for charging off loans varies with respect to the category of loans and specific circumstances surrounding each loan under consideration 
consumer loans are generally charged off when deemed to be uncollectible or days past due  whichever comes first 
charge offs of commercial loans and residential real estate mortgage loans are made on the basis of management s ongoing evaluation of non performing loans 
other income 
total other income was million for compared to million for several factors contributed to the increase in other income as discussed below 
retail banking fees were million for compared to million for this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of sovereign s transaction accounts and active fee collection efforts due in part to customer relationships acquired in the corestates and peoples acquisitions 
mortgage banking revenues were million for compared to million for at december   sovereign serviced billion of its own loans and billion of loans for others 
this compares to billion of its own loans and billion of loans for others at december  loan fees and service charges were million for compared to million for loan fees and service charges relate primarily to sovereign s non residential loan portfolios  and the growth period to period is the result of growth in the commercial and consumer loan portfolios due to internal growth and acquisitions 
net gains on sales of loans and investment securities were million for compared to million for  which included net investment security gains of million and million  and net gains on sales of loans of million and million in and  respectively 
this decrease was in part due to a net gain of million resulting from the sale of sovereign s credit card portfolio during the second quarter of  and gains on sales of investment securities available for sale during income from bank owned life insurance boli was million for compared to million for this increase was primarily due to an additional investment in boli  which was made during the first quarter of general and administrative expenses

financial condition loan portfolio 
sovereign s loan portfolio at december  was billion compared to billion at december  sovereign s loan portfolio has increased as a result of strong originations during the year 
with its increased focus on non residential lending and sovereign s acquisition activity over the past few years  at december   sovereign s total loan portfolio included billion of commercial loans and billion of consumer loans  including billion of outstanding home equity loans secured primarily by second mortgages on owner occupied one to four family residential properties and billion of auto loans 
this compares to billion of commercial loans and billion of consumer loans  including billion of outstanding home equity loans and billion of auto loans  at december  additionally  at december   sovereign has extended billion and million of unused commitments for commercial loans and home equity lines of credit  respectively

larger commercial loans are allocated loan loss allowance based upon individual asset risk assessments 
credit risk management 
extending credit exposes sovereign to credit risk  which is the risk that the principal balance of a loan and any related interest will not be collected due to the inability of the borrower to repay the loan 
sovereign manages credit risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to consistent standards  guidelines and limitations established by the board of directors 
written loan policies establish underwriting standards  lending limits and other standards or limits as deemed necessary and prudent 
various approval levels  based on the amount of the loan and whether the loan is secured or unsecured  have also been established 
loan approval authority ranges from the individual loan officer to the board of directors loan committee 
the loan review group conducts ongoing  independent reviews of the lending process to ensure adherence to established policies and procedures  monitors compliance with applicable laws and regulations  provides objective measurement of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio  and ensures that proper documentation exists 
the results of these periodic reviews are reported to the asset review committee  and to the board of directors of both sovereign and sovereign bank 
in response to sovereign s increased emphasis on commercial and consumer lending  sovereign has added to its loan review group by hiring loan review officers with significant commercial and consumer experience 
sovereign also maintains a watch list for certain loans identified as requiring a higher level of monitoring by management because of one or more factors  such as economic conditions  industry trends  nature of collateral  collateral margin  payment history  or other factors 
the following discussion summarizes the underwriting policies and procedures for the major categories within the loan portfolio and address sovereign s strategies for managing the related credit risk 
commercial loans 
credit risk associated with commercial loans is primarily influenced by prevailing and expected economic conditions and the level of underwriting risk sovereign is willing to assume 
to manage credit risk when extending commercial credit  sovereign focuses on both assessing the borrower s ability to repay and on obtaining sufficient collateral 
commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by the borrower s assets and by personal guarantees 
commercial real estate loans are originated primarily within the pennsylvania  new jersey  and new england market areas and are secured by developed real estate at conservative loan to values and often by a guarantee of the borrower 
management closely monitors the composition and quality of the total commercial loan portfolio to ensure that significant credit concentrations by borrower or industry do not exist 
consumer loans 
credit risk in the direct consumer loan portfolio is controlled by strict adherence to conservative underwriting standards that consider debt to income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower and  if secured  collateral values 
in the home equity loan portfolio  combined loan to value ratios are generally limited to or credit insurance is purchased to limit exposure 
other credit considerations may warrant higher combined loan to value ratios for approved loans 
the portion of the consumer portfolio which is secured by real estate  vehicles  deposit accounts or government guarantees comprises of the entire portfolio 
residential loans 
sovereign originates fixed rate and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans which are secured by the underlying family residential property 
at december  and  residential loans accounted for and respectively  of the total loan portfolio 
this decrease was the outcome of sovereign s increased emphasis on commercial and consumer lending 
credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower  including debt to equity ratios  credit scores  and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan to value ratios of generally no more than 
residential mortgage loans granted in excess of the loan to value ratio criterion are generally insured by private mortgage insurance  unless otherwise guaranteed or insured by the federal  state or local government 
sovereign also utilizes underwriting standards which comply with those of the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or the federal national mortgage association fnma 
credit risk is further reduced since a portion of sovereign s fixed rate mortgage loan production and all of its sub prime mortgage loan production is sold to investors in the secondary market without recourse 
collections 
sovereign closely monitors delinquencies as another means of maintaining high asset quality 
collection efforts begin within days after a loan payment is missed by attempting to contact all borrowers and to offer a variety of loss mitigation alternatives 
if these attempts fail  sovereign will proceed to gain control of any and all collateral in a timely manner in order to minimize losses 
while liquidation and recovery efforts continue  officers continue to work with the borrowers  if appropriate  to recover all monies owed to sovereign 
sovereign monitors delinquency trends at   and days past due 
these trends are discussed at the monthly committee meetings 
minutes from these meetings are submitted to the board of directors of sovereign bank 
approximately million  or  of the loans in the loan portfolio at december   were to days delinquent  compared to million  or of portfolio loans  at december  sovereign also maintains a watch list for loans identified as requiring a higher level of monitoring by management because of one or more factors  such as economic conditions  industry trends  nature of collateral  collateral margin  payment history or other factors 
non performing assets 
at december   sovereign s non performing assets were million compared to million at december  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets was 
at december  compared to 
at december  this decrease  both in dollars and as a percent of total assets  is a result in part of the aforementioned non performing asset sales in the second and fourth quarters of and an active non performing loan management program 
at december   of non performing assets consisted of loans related to real estate or oreo 
another of non performing assets consist of indirect auto loans and other repossessed assets 
indirect auto loans delinquent in excess of days carry an allowance allocation of 
repossessed autos carry an allowance allocation of 
the remainder of sovereign s non performing assets consist principally of consumer loans  many of which are secured by collateral 
sovereign places all loans days or more delinquent except auto loans and loans guaranteed by the government or secured by deposit accounts on non performing status 
sovereign s auto loans continue to accrue interest until they are days delinquent  at which time they are placed on non accrual status and a allowance allocation is assigned

impaired loans 
at december  and  the gross recorded investment in impaired loans totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase in the investment in impaired loans at december  compared to december  was primarily the result of sovereign s recent balance sheet transformation strategy which places more emphasis on building the commercial and consumer loan portfolios 
along with higher yields  these loan types also bring greater risk of impairment  especially as the portfolio becomes more seasoned 
sovereign classifies all commercial loans that are greater than days delinquent on non accrual status  and classifies certain criticized loans as impaired 
impaired loans includes a significant portion of potential problem loans discussed in a following paragraph 
these are primarily commercial loans that have been classified internally but are not necessarily days delinquent 
gross interest income for the years ended december   and would have increased by approximately million  million and million  respectively  had sovereign s period end non accruing and restructured loans been current in accordance with their original terms and outstanding throughout the period 
interest income recorded on these loans for the years ended december    and was million  million and million  respectively 
potential problem loans consisting of loans for which management has doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with present repayment terms  although not currently classified as non performing loans amounted to approximately million at december  and consisted principally of commercial loans 
allowance for loan loss 
the adequacy of sovereign s allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance to absorb potential loan losses takes into consideration the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  past loan loss experience  specific loans which have loss potential  geographic and industry concentrations  delinquency trends  economic conditions  the level of originations and other relevant factors 
management also considers loan quality  changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  consultation with regulatory authorities  amount of non performing loans  delinquency trends  economic conditions and industry trends when determining the allowance 
at december   sovereign s loan delinquencies all loans greater than days delinquent as a percentage of total loans was compared to at december  this decrease was primarily attributable to sovereign s business decision to accelerate the disposition of certain non performing residential mortgage loans  as well as improved collections efforts for its loan portfolio 
overall  management believes delinquencies  charge offs and non performing statistics are improved compared to previous years because of changes in sovereign s underwriting and credit monitoring process during  and the fact in the current year versus prior year  a larger percentage of sovereign s loan portfolio primarily indirect and commercial loans represents internally generated loans that were underwritten using sovereign s own underwriting policy 
at december   sovereign s loan portfolio was residential  consumer and commercial 
at december   sovereign s loan portfolio was residential  consumer and commercial 
along with higher yields  management believes this shift in loan composition brings higher inherent risk

as discussed in credit management  sovereign believes the current allowance to be at a level adequate to cover such inherent losses 
at december   the company s total allowance was million 
the company s total allowance at year end equated to approximately times the average charge offs for the last three years and times the average net charge offs for the same three year period 
because historical charge offs are not necessarily indicative of future charge off levels  the company also gives consideration to other risk indicators when determining the appropriate allowance level 
the allowance for loan losses consists of two elements i an allocated allowance  which is comprised of allowances established on specific loans  and class allowances based on historical loan loss experience and current trends  and ii unallocated allowances based on both general economic conditions and other risk factors in the company s individual markets and portfolios  and to account for a level of imprecision in management s estimation process 
the specific allowance element of the allocated allowance is based on a regular analysis of criticized loans where internal credit ratings are below a predetermined classification 
this analysis is performed at the relationship manager level  and periodically reviewed by the loan review department 
the specific allowance established for these criticized loans is based on a careful analysis of related collateral value  cash flow considerations and  if applicable  guarantor capacity 
the class allowance element of the allocated allowance is determined by an internal loan grading process in conjunction with associated allowance factors 
these class allowance factors are updated annually and are based primarily on actual historical loss experience  consultation with regulatory authorities  and peer groups loss experience 
while this analysis is conducted annually  the company has the ability to revise the class allowance factors whenever necessary in order to address improving or deteriorating credit quality trends or specific risks associated with a given loan pool classification 
regardless of the extent of the company analysis of customer performance  portfolio evaluations  trends or risk management processes established  certain inherent  but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio 
this is due to several factors including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends  volatility of economic or customer specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger non homogeneous credits  and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allocated allowances for homogeneous groups of loans among other factors 
the company maintains an unallocated allowance to recognize the existence of these exposures 
these other risk factors are continuously reviewed and revised by management where conditions indicate that the estimates initially applied are different from actual results 
a comprehensive analysis of the allowance for loan losses is performed by the company on a quarterly basis 
in addition  a review of allowance levels based on nationally published statistics is conducted on an annual basis 
the company has an asset review committee  which has the responsibility of affirming allowance methodology and assessing the general and specific allowance factors in relation to estimated and actual net charge off trends 
this committee is also responsible for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses for each loan pool classification at sovereign 
residential portfolio 
the allowance for the residential mortgage portfolio decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease was due primarily to the aforementioned sale of the non performing loan portfolio during  which enhanced the overall performance of the remaining portfolio 
consumer portfolio 
the allowance for the consumer loan portfolio decreased from million at december  to million at december   and is due to management s continual assessment of the credit quality of the consumer portfolio 
specifically  during  the company enhanced its underwriting and credit monitoring processes related to its indirect auto portfolio  which has resulted in a decrease in delinquencies outstanding to of the december  portfolio from of the december  portfolio 
charge offs related to the indirect portfolio were 
of the portfolio  down from in additionally  as acquired consumer portfolios continued to season and were exposed to sovereign s credit monitoring and collection processes  sovereign could accurately monitor loss statistics and the company determined that the general reserve factors associated with such portfolios could be reduced 
commercial portfolio 
the portion of the allowance for loan losses related to the commercial portfolio has increased million  or  to million at december  this increase is primarily attributable to the significant growth in the commercial loan portfolio 
unallocated allowance 
the decrease in the unallocated allowance versus the prior year is related to the company s ability to reallocate the unallocated allowance to the various portfolios as a result of management s enhancement of its credit analysis  and favorable delinquency and non performing statistics 
investment securities 
sovereign s investment portfolio is concentrated in mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by federal agencies or private label issues 
the private label issues have ratings of aaa by standard and poor s and fitch at the date of issuance 
the classes are backed by single family residential loans which are primary residences geographically dispersed throughout the united states 
sovereign purchases classes which are senior positions backed by subordinate classes 
the subordinate classes absorb the losses and must be completely eliminated before any losses flow through the senior positions 
sovereign s strategy is to purchase classes which have an average life of four years or less 
the effective duration of the total investment portfolio at december  was years

sovereign utilizes borrowings as a source of funds for its asset growth and its asset liability management 
collateralized advances are available from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh fhlb provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met 
another source of funds for sovereign is reverse repurchase agreements 
reverse repurchase agreements are short term obligations collateralized by investment securities 
total borrowings at december  were billion  of which billion were short term  compared to total borrowings of billion  of which billion were short term  at december  the increase in fhlb advances is principally due to loan growth during the period being funded by borrowings 
the increase in other borrowings is due to million senior notes and million senior secured credit facility  issued in november and december   in anticipation of the acquisition of sovereign bank new england

liquidity and capital resources sovereign bank is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain specified levels of liquid investments in cash and us treasury securities and other qualifying investments 
regulations currently in effect require sovereign bank to maintain liquid assets of not less than of its net withdrawable accounts plus short term borrowings 
these levels are changed from time to time by the office of thrift supervision ots to reflect economic conditions 
sovereign bank s liquidity ratio for december was 
sovereign s primary financing sources are deposits obtained in its own market area and borrowings in the form of securities sold under repurchase agreements and advances from the fhlb 
while the majority of sovereign s certificate of deposit accounts are expected to mature within a one year period  historically  the retention rate has been approximately 
if a significant portion of maturing certificates would not renew at maturity  the impact on sovereign s operations and liquidity would be minimal due to cash flows produced by sovereign s investment portfolio which approximate million per month 
sovereign bank can also borrow from the fhlb  subject to required collateralization 
other sources of funds include operating activities  repayments of principal on investment securities  repayment of principal on loans and other investing activities 
sovereign also maintains strong relationships with numerous investment banking firms  and has the ability to access the capital markets through a variety of products and structures  should liquidity or capital needs arise 
sovereign raised billion of debt and equity in november and december  to finance its pending acquisition of sovereign bank new england

at december   sovereign bank was classified as well capitalized and was in compliance with all capital requirements 
for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital requirements  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements hereof 
the following table sets forth the capital ratios of sovereign bancorp and sovereign bank and the current regulatory requirements at december  well sovereign sovereign minimum capitalized bancorp bank requirement requirement tangible capital to tangible assets none leverage core capital to tangible assets leverage core capital to risk adjusted assets risk based capital to risk adjusted assets ots capital regulations do not apply to thrift holding companies 
sovereign bancorp ratios are computed using quarterly average tangible assets  which is consistent with the method used by bank holding companies 
asset and liability management the objective of sovereign s asset and liability management is to identify  measure and manage its interest rate risk in order to produce consistent earnings that are not contingent upon favorable trends in interest rates 
sovereign manages its assets and liabilities to attain a stable net interest margin across a wide spectrum of interest rate environments 
this is attained by monitoring the levels of interest rates  the relationships between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities  the absolute amount of assets and liabilities which reprice or mature over similar periods  off balance sheet positions and the effect of all these factors on the estimated level of net interest income 
sovereign measures interest rate risk utilizing three tools net interest income simulation analysis in multiple interest rate environments  instantaneous parallel interest rate shocks and lastly  gap analysis  which is a schedule measuring the difference between assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions which will mature or reprice within specific terms 
income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net income  but also other factors  such as yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  customer preferences and general market conditions 
sovereign manages the impact to net interest income in a basis point instantaneous rate shock environment to be within a variance 
sovereign estimates that if interest rates decline by basis points  net interest income would decrease by million  or  for as compared to million  or  for conversely  if interest rates increase by basis points  net interest income would decrease by million  or  for as compared to million  or  for sovereign generally manages the one year interest rate gap within a range 
a positive gap position implies that the bank is asset sensitive  which could cause net interest income to decrease if interest rates fall 
conversely  a negative gap position implies that the bank is liability sensitive  which could cause net interest income to decrease if interest rates rise 
sovereign estimates that the cumulative one year gap position was a negative and a positive at december  and  respectively 
the negative position at december   is a result of positioning for the sovereign bank new england acquisition in pursuant to its interest rate risk management strategy  sovereign enters into off balance sheet transactions which involve interest rate exchange agreements swaps  caps and floors for interest rate risk management purposes 
sovereign s objective in managing its interest rate risk is to provide sustainable levels of net interest income while limiting the impact that changes in interest rates have on net interest income 
interest rate swaps are generally used to convert fixed rate assets and liabilities to variable rate assets and liabilities and vice versa 
sovereign utilizes interest rate swaps that have a high degree of correlation to the related financial instrument 
at december   sovereign s principal off balance sheet transactions were to convert liabilities from fixed rate to floating rate to reduce the cost of funds 
interest rate caps are generally used to limit the exposure from the repricing and maturity of liabilities and interest rate floors are generally used to limit the exposure from the repricing and maturity of assets 
interest rate caps and floors are also used to limit the exposure created by other interest rate swaps 
in certain cases  interest rate caps and floors are simultaneously bought and sold to create a range of protection against changing interest rates while limiting the cost of that protection 
as part of its mortgage banking strategy  sovereign originates fixed rate residential mortgages 
it sells the majority of these loans to fhlmc  fnma and private investors 
the loans are exchanged for cash or marketable fixed rate mortgage backed securities which are generally sold 
this helps insulate sovereign from the interest rate risk associated with these fixed rate assets 
sovereign uses forward sales  cash sales and options on mortgage backed securities as a means of hedging loans in the mortgage pipeline which are originated for sale 
sovereign s primary funding source is deposits obtained in its own marketplace 
deposit programs at sovereign are priced to meet management s asset liability objectives  while taking into account the rates available on lending opportunities and also considering the cost of alternative funding sources 
borrowings are a significant funding source for sovereign and have primarily been in the form of securities sold under repurchase agreements and advances from the fhlb 
since borrowings are not subject to the market constraints to which deposits are  sovereign uses borrowings to add flexibility to its interest rate risk position
