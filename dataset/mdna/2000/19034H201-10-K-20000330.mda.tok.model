item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a 
overview the company opened its first dental center in may and since then  has added internally developed and acquired dental centers 
the company derives its revenue through fees earned from the coast pa for providing management services and support at the dental centers  located in florida  georgia  tennessee and virginia 
as of december   coast dentists were employed by the coast pa  serving approximately  patients 
in the near future  the company plans to grow by utilizing existing excess capacity 
once the excess capacity is optimized  the company expects to expand the coast dental network in new and existing markets through the addition of internally developed and strategically opportunistic acquired dental centers 
pursuant to the services and support agreements with the coast pa  the company provides management services and support to facilitate the development and growth of dental centers 
operating expenses at the dental centers  with the exception of compensation paid to the coast dentists and dental hygienists  are expenses of the company and are recognized as incurred 
the services and support fees paid to the company by the coast pa have historically ranged from to of the dental centers gross revenue  net of refunds and discounts 
the company is dependent upon the future success of the coast pa and the ability of the coast pa to grow with the company 
the services and support fees between the parties may be revised from time to time based upon negotiations between the audit committee and the coast pa the company pays  out of the services and support fee  all of the operating and non operating expenses incurred by the coast pa at the dental centers  except for the salaries and benefits of the coast dentists and dental hygienists 
for the period june  through january   the company paid the coast pa the sum of  in connection with each internally developed dental center it committed to open  in consideration for the coast pa s agreement to expand the services and support agreements to include the new internally developed dental centers 
effective february   the services and support agreements were modified to discontinue the payment of this fee  and the services and support fees were adjusted to of the dental centers gross revenue 
see notes and to the financial statements for further information 
the audit committee approved a further adjustment to the services and support fees beginning in january  to in connection with the coast pas anticipated roll out of a new compensation plan for coast dentists  which will be staged throughout the year 
as a result of the adjustment  the service and support fees are expected to average between and over the next several years 
recent developments recognizing the changes to its business caused by shifts in the dental practice management sector and its own growth  the company recently announced several operational initiatives aimed at strengthening and improving performance in and beyond 
the company believes these steps are crucial to maximizing long term shareholder value 
first  the company is curtailing the number of new dental center openings 
this reduced growth plan is designed to enable the company to fully optimize the opportunities in its existing dental centers 
another strategic decision was made to dramatically reduce the amount spent on television advertising 
the company is shifting some of the marketing focus internally to patient and employee relations  internal promotions  and patient referrals 
the company has also begun implementing an automated  centralized appointment confirmation system 
this system will enable the dental center staff to more efficiently utilize their time by advantageously applying technology to confirm patient appointments and reduce appointment cancellations and no shows 
the company s operations team expanded its regional vice president level of management to four and also increased staffing in the recruiting department to four professional recruiters 
the company believes the addition of its regional vice presidents will ensure the operations team is able to more effectively and proactively meet the needs of the dental centers 
likewise  the recruiting staff was enhanced to better handle the anticipated need for additional affiliated dental professionals 
the company s affiliated coast pas have developed in cooperation with the company a new professional compensation plan 
this plan is designed to provide incentive based compensation to the dental professionals by aligning compensation with the performance of the dental center 
compensation for all dentists will be based on individual performance  and for managing dentists  compensation will also depend  in part  on the financial results of the individual dental center in which the professional performs services 
while the company believes this form of compensation by the coast pas should serve to improve the company s revenue and bottom line performance in the longer term  the company and the affiliated pas have re negotiated the management fee in the short term to provide the pas with the ability to properly implement this new plan 
the implementation will be staged throughout and  as such the management fee has been adjusted to for the year 
important trends and data the company took a very significant step beginning in  shifting from an acquisition model to a development model 
at that time  management determined that it would go in a different direction  and a plan of opening internally developed dental centers from scratch was adopted 
the company has since placed less emphasis on acquiring dental centers 
while the ramp up of these brand new dental centers has been slower than anticipated  which has negatively impacted its financial performance  management is nonetheless excited by recent trends 
overall  the company s acquired dental centers have averaged annualized gross revenue of  per dental center compared to  for the company s mature internally developed dental centers opened for more than sixty months 
additionally  internally developed dental centers open between two and three years average  per year in gross revenue  internally developed dental centers open between one and two years average  per year in gross revenue and internally developed dental centers open less than one year average  per year in average gross revenue 
the average annualized gross revenue for dental centers open three years or less is  per year 
currently  the company manages internally developed dental centers less than months old which exemplifies the internal growth opportunity associated with the de novo model with minimal additional capital investment 
the company believes that as a result of its cost effective growth  principally through the development model  cash position  and relatively debt free balance sheet  it is in the financial position to slow down external growth in  and to achieve long term growth in a more cost effective and productive manner 
the company opened nine internally developed dental centers in  in and in in florida  georgia and tennessee 
the average cost to the company of an internally developed dental center has been approximately  which included the cost of equipment  leasehold improvements  working capital and in years prior to  an agreed upon  payment per dental center  see notes and to the financial statements to the coast pa to open the additional dental centers thus expanding the services and support agreements to include the new internally developed dental centers 
at internally developed dental centers  profitability to the company has been attained within the first twelve months after opening 
the company s growth strategy  in addition to principally focusing on existing dental centers  will continue to include the addition of internally developed dental centers and when strategically opportunistic  acquisitions 
management believes that while the strategy of focusing on existing and adding internally developed dental centers is expected to result in slightly lower targeted revenue and operating margins in the short run  it is an effective use of its working capital and provides for low cost expansion and long term stockholder value
