additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements is contained in the company s sec reports  including the report on form k for the year ended december  overview we develop  market  license and support mademanage  an open architecture  standards based  client server enterprise business system software solution for small and midsize manufacturers engaged in engineer to order  make to order  assemble to order  make to stock and mixed styles of production 
we have developed manufacturing software applications for this market since our inception in our first generation of mademanage  designed for pc networks running the dos operating system on novell networks  was introduced in  and we introduced a unix version of mademanage in we ceased offering the dos and unix versions to new customers in and  respectively and we discontinued supporting these versions in in march we launched mmeport  our web site dedicated to the needs of small and midsize manufacturers 
this site will provide many internet resources for our customers and other manufacturers 
the mmeport site features advanced distance learning offerings  the ability to offer mademanage through an application service provider asp  along with content rich collaboration opportunities for customers and suppliers 
during we acquired bridgeware  inc  a company that offers advance planning and scheduling software  for a combination of cash and common stock 
the total cost of the acquisition was million 
in connection with this acquisition  we recorded a million in process technology charge 
the remaining costs of the acquisition are recorded as assets and are expected to be amortized over lives of five and seven years 
our revenues are derived from software licenses  services and hardware 
software revenues are generated from licensing software to new customers  and from current customers increasing the number of licensed users and from licensing new applications 
we recognize revenue from software license fees and hardware upon shipment to the customer following execution of a sales agreement 
service revenues are generated from annual fees paid by customers to receive support services and software upgrades and also from implementation  education and consulting services 
support is typically purchased as part of the initial sales agreement and is renewable annually 
support fees are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
service revenues from implementation  education and consulting services are generally included in the initial agreement 
we recognize revenue from these services as they are performed 
hardware revenues are generated primarily from the sale of bar coding and data collection equipment used in connection with mademanage and constitute a relatively small component of total revenues 
software revenues for a particular quarter depend substantially on orders received and products shipped in that quarter 
furthermore  large orders may be significant to operating income in the quarter in which the corresponding revenue is recognized

total revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in total revenues increased by million  or  in from million in the increase in was primarily due to an increase in service and support revenues 
the increase in was primarily due to a greater volume of license transactions  an increase in average order size and sales of new software modules  all of which was driven by an increase in market awareness and acceptance of mademanage and the expansion of our sales and marketing organizations 
we have not historically recognized significant annual revenues from any single customer 
although revenues have increased in over and  we believe during the last six months  of  we were adversely impacted by the industry wide trend of delays in new business system purchases due to the year market dynamics  as manufacturers delayed major business system purchases 
see business environment and risk factors year market dynamics for a description of year market dynamics and potential revenue impact 
software revenues 
software revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in and increased by million  or  in from million in software license revenues constituted  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in software license revenues in was mainly due to a lower volume of license transactions and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in the average contract size 
the increases in software license revenues in and were primarily due to a greater volume of license transactions and  to a lesser extent  increases in average contract size 
the decreases in the percentage of total revenues represented by software revenue resulted from the greater rate of growth in services revenues  and  in  was due in part to the reduced demand for enterprise business systems due to industry wide year market dynamics 
services revenues 
services revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in and by million  or  in from million in these revenues constituted  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increases in the revenues recognized were due to i increased support fees from a larger user base  ii greater utilization by customers of implementation  consulting and customization services offerings and iii delivery of expanded educational offerings 
hardware revenues 
hardware revenues increased by  or  to million in from  in and by  or  in from  in these revenues constituted  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the hardware equipment sold is bar coding and data collection equipment necessary to utilize certain features of mademanage 
the increases were due to increased demand for this equipment as a result of continued expansion of the number of customers using our software 
costs of revenues costs of software revenues 
costs of software revenues totaled million  million and  in  and  respectively  resulting in gross profits of  and of software revenues  respectively 
the decrease in the gross profit in and was due to a greater proportion of revenue generated from third party products 
amortization of purchased technology 
this expense of  and  in and  respectively  results from amortizing the value assigned to bridgeware technology and is being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
costs of services revenues 
costs of services revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  resulting in gross profits of  and of service revenues  respectively 
the cost increases were due primarily to the growth in our installed customer base and related support services revenue  which resulted in an increase in the staffing levels for technical support  implementation  customization and education services 
the increase in gross profits in compared to was due to one time costs incurred in to develop customer requirements 
costs of hardware 
costs of hardware totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
the gross profit from hardware was  and of hardware revenues in  and  respectively 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in was primarily due to increased i staffing for sales and marketing  ii marketing activities  including promotional activities  iii travel expenses related to sales and marketing efforts  and  iv the costs of beginning international sales efforts 
the increases in sales and marketing expenses in and were principally due to increased i staffing for sales and marketing  ii marketing activities  including promotional activities  iii travel expenses related to sales and marketing efforts  and  iv commissions as a result of increased license revenues 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenue in compared to was a result of greater productivity 
product development expenses 
product development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
we did not capitalize any software development costs during these years  since the capitalizable portion was not significant 
product development expenses increased in as a percent of revenue over as we continued to invest in our product to meet competitive pressures 
we expect product development costs will continue to increase in proportion to the increase in revenues  but not as a percent of revenue 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the expense increases resulted primarily from additional costs incurred to support the growth of operations and  to a lesser extent  as a result of the addition of personnel 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
this expense of  and  in and  respectively  results from amortizing excess cost over net assets acquired and assembled workforce related to the acquisition of bridgeware 
acquired in process technology 
this charge of million in is a result of the amounts assigned to in process technology in connection with the acquisition of bridgeware 
on a pro forma basis  exclusive of the bridgeware acquisition charge for in process technology and amortization of purchase related assets  results of operations would be comparatively reported as follows 
results excluding acquired in process technology charge and related intangible assets amortization year ended december  total revenues    operating income loss    net income loss   per share amounts basic net income loss per share average number of shares   diluted net income loss per share 

average number of shares    intangible assets amortization for purchased technology  assembled workforce and excess cost over net assets acquired recorded in connection with the bridgeware acquisition  net of related tax 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was  and  of income in and  respectively and  of expense in  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
other income in and principally reflects interest earned on the proceeds of our initial public offering  which was completed in december the other expense in was principally interest on borrowings  which were subsequently repaid from proceeds of the initial public offering 
income tax provision benefit the income tax provision benefit effective rate was in and  excluding the in process research technology charge  in and in the effective rate was higher for compared to primarily due to the impact of non deductible amortization 
the effective rate was lower for compared to due to the impact of tax free interest included in other income expense  net  offset  in part  by non deductible intangible assets amortization in the acquired in process technology charge is not deductible for income tax purposes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year compliance the year issue relates to whether computer systems are able to properly recognize and process information relating to dates in and after the year prior to january   significant uncertainty existed in the software industry concerning the potential consequences that might have occurred from the failure of software to adequately address the year issue 
we have not encountered any year compliance issues relating to our currently developed and actively marketed software products or with our internal computer information system and non computer systems 
our current product and service offerings have been designed to be year compliant though earlier versions of our products that are not the most currently released or are not currently being developed may not be year compliant 
year compliance issues have many elements and consequences  some of which cannot be readily detected or foreseen 
we will continue to monitor our operations for year problems 
any failure of our software product and service offerings or our internal computer information system or non computer systems to properly process dates could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we expensed all costs related to preparation for year issues 
the total costs of evaluation and compliance were not material 
market dynamics 
we believe that during we were adversely affected by year market dynamics  and we are uncertain of the impact year market dynamics will have on us during see business environmental and risk factors year market dynamics for a description of year market dynamics and potential revenue impact 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
accounting pronouncements in december  the aicpa issued sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  which will retain the limitation of sop on what constitutes vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
sop was effective for transaction entered into in fiscal years beginning after march  we believe that our current revenue recognition policies and practices are consistent with the provisions of the new guidance 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded operations to date primarily through equity capital  including the initial public offering of common stock in december  debt and cash generated from operations 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and investments resulting principally from the proceeds of our initial public offering 
cash flows from operations were  million and million in  and  respectively 
during we used million of cash in connection with the acquisition of bridgeware 
other cash usage included the purchase of computer equipment and office furniture and aggregated million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during we received  from the exercise of stock options and purchase of common stock under the stock purchase plan and realized tax benefits of  from stock option exercises 
subsequent to the acquisition of bridgeware in  we repaid  of outstanding bridgeware indebtedness 
net borrowings decreased  in principally as a result of the repayment of outstanding indebtedness using the proceeds of the initial public offering 
at december   we had working capital of million 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the average accounts receivable days outstanding was days at december   and days as of december  deferred revenue increased to million at december   from million at december  deferred revenue principally relates to support agreements or contracted services  and the current portion of deferred revenue is expected to be recognized in revenue during the next twelve months 
deferred revenue increased primarily as a result of high support renewal rates from the installed base of customers and from sales of new systems that contain support and service components which are recognized on a straight line basis over the support period or when the service is delivered 
we have a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank which expires on march   borrowings under which bear interest at the prime rate at december  
loans under the revolving credit agreement are limited  in the aggregate  to the lesser of million and a borrowing base amount 
as of december   we satisfied the borrowing base requirements and were eligible to borrow up to the maximum of million 
we have not borrowed under the revolving line of credit 
we expect to renew our line of credit april  we believe that cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and credit commitments will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through business environment and risk factors in addition to other information contained in this report  the following factors could affect our actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from those achieved in the past or expressed in our forward looking statements 
fluctuations of quarterly operating results  seasonality we have experienced in the past  and expect to experience in the future  significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
a substantial portion of our software license revenue in each quarter is from licenses signed and product shipped in that quarter  and such revenues historically have been recorded largely in the third month of a quarter  with a concentration of revenues mostly in the last week of that third month 
accordingly  our quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict  and delays in closings of sales near the end of a quarter or product delivery could cause quarterly revenues and  to a greater degree  net income to fall substantially short of anticipated levels 
in addition  we have experienced a seasonal pattern in our operating results  with the fourth quarter typically having the highest total revenues and operating income and the first quarter having historically reported lower revenues and operating income compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year 
other factors  many of which are beyond our control  that may contribute to fluctuations in quarterly operating results include the size of individual orders  the timing of product introductions or enhancements by us and our competitors  competition and pricing in the manufacturing software industry  market acceptance of new products  reduction in demand for existing products  the shortening of product life cycles as a result of new product introductions by us or our competitors  product quality problems  personnel changes  conditions or events in the manufacturing industry  and general economic conditions 
the sales cycle for mademanage typically ranges from three to nine months 
however  license signing may be delayed for a number of reasons outside of our control 
since software is generally shipped as orders are received  we have historically operated without significant backlog 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  small variations in the timing of revenue recognition can cause a significant fluctuation in operating results from quarter to quarter and may result in unanticipated quarterly earnings shortfalls or losses 
in addition  we currently intend to increase operating expenses in anticipation of continued growth and to fund expanded product development efforts 
to the extent such expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
year market dynamics we believe the year planning cycle reduced demand for enterprise business systems in in addition  each customer s evaluation of its need to achieve year compliance with other internal systems potentially lengthened the sales cycle 
we believe that in certain customers and potential customers were engaged in testing and correcting system year problems  and such customers may have chosen to defer system investments during  negatively impacting our revenues 
additionally  prior year sales may have been increased due to customers need to address year issues 
such year demand most likely was reduced in due to the lead time required to implement new systems  possibly negatively impacting our revenues 
our sales cycles may lengthen in and future years due to lessened urgency of customers system investment decisions 
because year related impacts on customer purchasing decisions were unprecedented  we have a limited ability to determine the impact of the year market dynamics on our quarter to quarter revenues in product and market concentration our revenues are currently derived from licenses of mademanage  including optional modules  licensing of bridgeware s advanced planning and scheduling products and third party software  and related support  services and hardware 
in the near term  mademanage and related services are expected to continue to account for substantially all of the our revenues 
accordingly  any event that adversely affects the sale of mademanage  such as competition from other products  significant quality problems  incompatibility with third party hardware or software products  negative publicity or evaluation  reduced market acceptance of  or obsolescence of the hardware platforms on  or software environments in  which mademanage operates  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends substantially upon the software expenditures of small and midsize manufacturers  which in part depend upon the demand for such manufacturers products 
a recession or other adverse event affecting manufacturing industries in the united states could impact such demand  forcing manufacturers in our target market to curtail or postpone capital expenditures for business information systems 
any adverse change in the amount or timing of software expenditures by our target customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on third party technologies mademanage uses a variety of third party technologies  including operating systems  tools and other applications developed and supported by microsoft corporation microsoft 
there can be no assurance that microsoft will continue to support the operating systems  tools and other applications utilized by mademanage or that they will continue to be widely accepted in our target market 
mademanage relies heavily on microsoft s visual studio  and there can be no assurance that microsoft will not discontinue or otherwise fail to support visual studio or any of its components 
in addition  we use a number of other programming tools and applications  including activex  ole  odbc  oledb and internet information server 
we sublicense various third party products  including microsoft visual foxpro  microsoft project  products from powerway  best software  and frx  and bar code hardware and software 
there can be no assurance that these third party vendors will continue to support these technologies or that these technologies will retain their level of acceptance among manufacturers in our target market 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
product development our growth and future financial performance depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing applications and to develop and introduce new applications to incorporate technological advances that satisfy customer requirements or expectations 
as a result of the complexities inherent in product development  there can be no assurance that either improvements to mademanage or applications that we develop in the future will be delivered on a timely basis or ultimately accepted in the market 
any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to technological development or end user requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could damage our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel our success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key employees  including members of senior management 
no employee is subject to an employment contract 
our ability to implement business strategy is substantially dependent on our ability to attract  on a timely basis  and retain skilled personnel  especially sales  service  support and development personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we compete for such personnel with numerous companies  including larger  more established companies with significantly greater financial resources 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of the key employees or the failure to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth  international expansion we have experienced rapid growth in our business and operations 
while we have managed this growth to date  there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively do so in the future 
our ability to manage growth successfully is contingent on a number of factors including our ability to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems and to motivate and effectively manage employees 
while we plan to distribute mademanage in international markets  we have no significant experience in international markets and there can be no assurance that such expansion can be successfully accomplished 
if we are unable to manage future growth effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
risks associated with acquisitions as part of our business strategy  we expect to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing product offerings  augment market coverage or enhance technological capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect operating results and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
no assurance can be given as to our ability to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future  and the failure of to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or results of operations 
insufficient customer commitment to obtain the benefits of mademanage  customers must commit resources to implement and manage the product and to train their employees in the use of the product 
the failure of customers to commit sufficient resources to those tasks or to carry them out effectively could result in customer dissatisfaction with mademanage 
if a significant number of customers became dissatisfied  our reputation could be tarnished and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
competition the business management applications software market is intensely competitive  rapidly changing and significantly affected by new product offerings and other market activities 
we face competition from a variety of software vendors  including application software vendors  software tool vendors and relational database management systems vendors 
a number of companies offer windows compatible products that are directed at the market for erp systems 
the technologies we use to develop mademanage are generally available and widely known and include technologies developed by microsoft 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop products based on the same technology upon which mademanage is based 
our competitors include a large number of software and system vendors  many of which are public companies 
in addition  there are numerous international  national and regional vendors that offer alternative systems 
several software companies that have traditionally marketed erp systems to larger manufacturers have announced initiatives to market erp systems to midsize manufacturers 
compared to us  many of the existing competitors  as well as a number of potential competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources and a larger installed base of customers 
there can be no assurance that such competitors will not offer or develop products that are superior to mademanage or that achieve greater market acceptance 
if such competition were to result in significant price declines or loss of market share for mademanage  our business  financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected 
relationships with value added resellers we distribute our software products through a direct sales force and a network of value added resellers vars 
a significant portion of licenses of mademanage sold to new customers is sold by vars 
if some or all of the vars reduce their efforts to sell mademanage  promote competing products or terminate their relationships with us  our business  financial condition and results of operation would be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  vars frequently develop strong relationships with their customers  so if vars criticize us or our products to their customers  our reputation could be damaged  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
product liability and lack of insurance we market  sell and support software products used by manufacturers to manage their business operations and to store substantially all of their operational data 
software programs as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors  despite testing  which are discovered only after the product has been installed and used by customers 
there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in existing or future releases of our software or that any such errors will not impair the market acceptance of these products 
a customer could be required to cease operations temporarily and some or all of its key operational data could be lost or damaged if its information systems fail as the result of human error  mechanical difficulties or quality problems in mademanage or third party technologies utilized by mademanage 
we have insurance covering product liability or damages arising from negligent acts  errors  mistakes or omissions  however there can be no assurance that this insurance will be adequate 
a claim against us  if successful and of a sufficient magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on proprietary rights  risk of infringement we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that competitors will not independently develop products incorporating technology that is substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
furthermore  other than pending united states patent applications for software included in mademanage related to the material requirements planning regeneration feature and a navigational interface for the enterprise  the we have no patents or patent applications pending  and existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
in the event that we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that our technology infringes on the intellectual property of third parties  that we would prevail against any such claims or that a licensing agreement will be available on reasonable terms in the event of an unfavorable ruling on any such claim 
any such claim  with or without merit  would likely be time consuming and expensive to defend and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantial control by single shareholder as of march   hambrecht quist h q and its affiliates  as a group  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  h q and its affiliates will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
concentration of stock ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
effect of antitakeover provisions our amended and restated articles of incorporation the articles authorize the board of directors to issue  without shareholder approval  up to two million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as the board of directors may determine in its sole discretion 
the mademanage systems  inc stock option plan the option plan provides that  unless the board of directors or a committee of the our board of directors decides to the contrary  all outstanding options vest and become immediately exercisable upon a merger or similar transaction 
in addition  certain provisions of indiana law could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control 
further  certain provisions of indiana law impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions 
the foregoing provisions could discourage an attempt by a third party to acquire a controlling interest without the approval of management even if such third party were willing to purchase shares of common stock at a premium over its then market price 
possible volatility of stock price the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new applications by us or our competitors  the failure of earnings to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  as well as other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price of many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
shares eligible for future sale the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding  of which  shares of common stock are restricted shares  which are subject to volume and other limitations of rule and rule restrictions under the securities act 
as of march   there were options outstanding to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average price of share under mademanage systems  inc stock option plan the option plan  of which options to purchase  shares of common stock were then vested and exercisable 
we have reserved  shares of common stock for future grant under the option plan 
we have reserved  shares of common stock for issuance under the mademanage systems  inc employee stock purchase plan the stock purchase plan 
as of march    shares have been issued under the stock purchase plan 
we filed registration statements registering shares of common stock issued pursuant to the option plan and stock purchase plan on january  accordingly  shares issued pursuant to these plans will be saleable in the public market upon issuance  subject to certain restrictions 
absence of dividends we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain earnings  if any  for the development of our business 
investment risk despite the high credit ratings on our cash equivalents and investments  there is no assurance such agencies will not default on their obligations which could result in losses of principal and accrued interest
