the insurance companies primarily issued policies covering all or part of an insured s self insured retention  with limits generally up to  that follow the form of the policies for coverage in excess of the insurance companies policies 
the insurance companies did not issue exclusions on these policies 
the insurance companies also issued a number of policies with greater limits of coverage  and included a year exclusion on such policies 
the company is aware that year liabilities may be deemed not to be fortuitous in nature and  therefore  not covered under the policies underwritten by the insurance companies

however  changes in social and legal trends may establish coverage unintended for year exposures by re interpreting insurance contracts and exclusions
