in march  the company  with four other investors  formed aloe and herbs international  inc  a panamanian corporation  with the sole intent of acquiring a  acre tract of land in costa rica to be used for the production of aloe vera l 
leaves to be sold to the company at competitive  local market rates 
this would allow the company to save approximately on the per kilogram cost of leaves as compared to the cost of importing leaves from other central and south american countries 
aloe herbs subsequently formed a wholly owned subsidiary  rancho aloe cr  cr  a costa rica corporation  which acquired the land in april the company received  shares of aloe herbs common stock  which represents a ownership position  which was increased to in  in exchange for providing expertise in farming aloe plants and providing a cash advance to rancho aloe to be used for the purchase of aloe plants 
this cash advance of  is evidenced by a note receivable  payable in installments  with the final payment due in june the company also advanced  to aloe herbs in november for the acquisition of an irrigation system to improve production on the farm and allow harvesting of leaves year round

leaves from rancho aloe during the remainder of the year 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with comerica bank texas for a  line of credit  secured by accounts receivable and inventory 
this credit facility had an outstanding balance of  at december  to fund operating needs and is being used to secure the letter of credit described below 
in november  the company signed a licensing agreement with a supplier of calcium alginates and other wound care products 
under the agreement  the company has exclusive marketing rights for ten years to advanced calcium alginate products for north and south america and in the people s republic of china 
under the agreement  the company made an up front payment to the supplier of  in november in july and october  additional payments of  and  respectively  were paid to this supplier upon delivery of the carrasmart

hydrocolloid  a product launched in the third quarter of these payments resulted in an increase to other assets of the company

in february  the company entered into a supply agreement with oregon freeze dry  inc ofd  its supplier of freeze dried products 
the agreement required that the company establish a letter of credit equal to of the minimum purchase commitment of  but allowed for the amount of the letter of credit to be reduced by of the purchases made under the agreement

tm 
m freeze dried gel and the carringtonr aphthous ulcer patch for the company 
both of these products represent new technology and are in the early phase of marketing

m and carringtonr aphthous ulcer patch inventory on hand as of december  the supply agreement also required the company to make minimum monthly purchases of  in february  the supply agreement was amended to allow for unmet monthly minimum purchase requirements to be met by prepayments  to be applied to future purchases under the agreement  which allows the company to keep inventory at levels appropriate for sales demand 
in december  ofd agreed to add a freeze dried gel product as a listed product under the agreement 
the company is continuing its effort to develop the market for its freeze dried products 
due to the unique technology of these products  the effort has taken longer than was initially expected 
the current agreement expires in august the company no longer believes that it can satisfy the minimum purchase requirements of this agreement and has established a reserve of  to cover its estimated liability to ofd under the agreement 
the company is currently negotiating with ofd regarding purchase arrangements beyond the term of the current agreement 
the company believes that its available cash resources and expected cash flows from operations will provide the funds necessary to finance its current operations 
however  the company does not expect that its current cash resources will be sufficient to finance future major clinical studies and costs of filing new drug applications necessary to develop its products to their full commercial potential 
additional funds  therefore  may need to be raised through equity offerings  borrowings  licensing arrangements or other means  and there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such funds on satisfactory terms when they are needed 
the company is subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
certain of the company s proposed products will require governmental approval prior to commercial use 
the approval process applicable to prescription pharmaceutical products usually takes several years and typically requires substantial expenditures 
the company and any licensees may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in their respective efforts to secure necessary approvals 
future united states or foreign legislative or administrative acts could also prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s or any licensees products 
failure to obtain requisite governmental approvals or failure to obtain approvals of the scope requested could delay or preclude the company or any licensees from marketing their products  or could limit the commercial use of the products  and thereby have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition

this market has continued to be very competitive and price sensitive as a result of pressures to control health care costs and has become increasingly commodity oriented 
in addition  the market is heavily influenced by government reimbursement programs 
the home health care segment of the market again experienced significant turmoil in as many of the company s customers either went out of business or postponed buying decisions due to changes in government reimbursement programs

nursing homes were also impacted by government regulations in  as government mandated reimbursement changes due to go into effect in january were postponed until the year many nursing home facilities and the dealers who supply them postponed buying decisions and liquidated inventory in anticipation of the regulations taking effect

year issues like many organizations  the company faced the prospect of what would happen to computers and other microprocessor controlled equipment using two digit data fields when they encountered the year  which could be mistaken as the year this was known as the year issue 
with respect to this issue  the company undertook efforts to assess the impact on its information technology systems  non information technology systems  such as production and laboratory equipment  and third party business partners such as vendors and customers 
the results of this assessment  which included analysis and compliance testing  showed that virtually all of the company s internal systems  as well as the systems of almost all of its vendors and customers  were prepared to handle the year issue without interruption of sales or service 
nevertheless  the company prepared an assessment of its most reasonably likely worst case scenario for dealing with year related disruptions and estimated that it would spend approximately  on equipment and software remediation and approximately  on a buildup of inventory 
the company did find several minor instances of software programs which needed upgrading  and several equipment items which needed upgrading or replacing  in order to be year ready 
the company spent approximately  on the upgrading or replacement of such programs and equipment 
the company spent approximately  on its inventory buildup program  but did not experience any unusual levels of order demand in the fourth quarter of relating to year concerns 
the company has subsequently been reducing its inventory to normal levels excluding this buildup 
the company did not experience any significant disruptions to its business systems or equipment as a result of year issues  nor does it expect to experience any such disruptions to its systems in the future 
the company also did not experience any disruptions in the delivery of products or services obtained from its vendors as a result of year issues
