item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of vidamed s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report on form k  and the cautionary statements regarding future operations presented herein at the end of this item overview since its founding in  vidamed has been engaged in the design  development and marketing of urological systems used to treat the enlarged prostate or benign prostatic hyperplasia  commonly known as bph 
we commenced international sales of our patented tuna system in late and began commercial sales in the united states in october  after receiving the food and drug administration clearance 
in we sold the tuna system to domestic office based urology practices  assuming that after receiving fda clearance  medicare reimbursement would soon follow 
in it was announced that office based medicare reimbursement for the tuna system and procedure would be delayed due to year computer problems experienced by medicare  and that current reimbursement was approved only in a hospital based setting  on a reasonable cost basis  and that it would require a state by state approval process 
at the end of fiscal  we began restructuring our sales and marketing model to take advantage of existing hospital based medicare reimbursement coverage 
under our current model  known as the fee per use program  we place an entire tuna system with a hospital at no charge to the hospital 
revenue is generated by selling a single use component needed for each tuna procedure performed 
once the procedure is performed  the single use component is discarded and a new component must be purchased for the next procedure performed 
as of february   states provide for hospital based reimbursement coverage for the tuna procedure 
we believe that obtaining medicare reimbursement coverage in doctors offices and ambulatory surgery centers  as well as patient awareness and physician advocacy of the tuna procedure  are our greatest challenges 
our business strategy is to focus marketing and sales efforts on patient education and physician support for our fee per use program while at the same time continue to advance medicare reimbursement coverage for the tuna procedure 
results of operations revenues 
net revenues for were million  an increase of million or nearly times over net revenues of million  and down from record revenues in of million 
in  we recognized sales reserves of million to adjust for the impact of a delay in office based medicare reimbursement 
excluding this specific sales reserve  revenues were million in revenue fluctuations over the three year period from through are primarily attributed to the following i record revenue performance in  of million  occurred as a result of receiving fda clearance in the us in late to sell the tuna system 
revenues included capital equipment and catheter sales to urologist offices in the us  a sale of systems to tenet healthcare systems  and nonrecurring license fees and an initial stocking order received in from our japanese distributor following japanese approval of the tuna system 
ii in mid  medicare coverage for supplies and devices in the office based and ambulatory surgery center markets was delayed due to medicare announced yk compliance issues 
we estimated that medicare reimbursement approvals and coverage for procedures performed in these markets would be delayed at least until july as a result of the delay  we established the million sales reserve in third quarter of  reducing net revenue of million to million 
iii in late and early  we implemented a strategy to focus our sales and marketing efforts on us hospitals  where medicare had authorized reimbursement for the tuna procedure  subject to state approvals 
we began with approvals in states  and ended the year with approvals in states 
in addition  we implemented a new fee per use sales and marketing model at the end of  that allows customers to pay a fee for a single use catheter needed to perform a tuna procedure  without the need for any large capital expenditure 
the combination of established reimbursement and the new fee per use sales and marketing model were the primary contributors to revenues of million 
medicare coverage for supplies and devices in the office based and ambulatory surgery center markets is not expected to be effective in the near future 
the failure to receive medicare reimbursement coverage at adequate reimbursement rates within the ambulatory surgery center or physicians office  or a failure to continue to receive adequate medicare reimbursement in the hospital setting in the year  could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues 
cost of sales and gross margins 
cost of product sold in decreased to million from million in  due primarily to the implementation of our fee per use sales model and the increased unit sales of disposable catheter sales versus higher cost generators 
cost of product sold in decreased to million from million in the higher cost of sales in is due primarily to higher product sales and a one time charge of million related to the closure of our research and manufacturing facility in the united kingdom 
due to increased fee per use sales in the united states  we recognized a significant increase in gross margin in under the fee per use program we place the tuna capital equipment with hospitals at no charge and sell single use catheters for each tuna procedure performed 
we amortize the cost of the tuna equipment to cost of sales and recognize the cost of each catheter upon shipment 
gross margin was million or of revenues 
gross margin in was a negative million 
after adjusting for the million in sales reserves recorded in  gross margin was million or of adjusted revenues of million 
the gross margin in was million or of revenue  including a million one time charge to cost of sales related to the closure of our facility in the united kingdom 
research and development 
research and development expenses include expenditures for regulatory compliance and clinical trials 
clinical trial costs consist largely of payments to clinical investigators  product for clinical trials  and costs associated with initiating and monitoring clinical trials 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in  and down from million in the decrease from the year ended to is primarily due to reduced clinical activity in  resulting from the completion of food and drug administration clinical trial studies  and the completion of research and development expenditures for our current provu generation of products in the decrease in research and development expenditures from the year ended to is attributed to significant development and clinical trial costs in related to the tuna system radio frequency generator and cost savings in from the closure of the facility in the united kingdom 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in  and million in the higher selling  general and administrative costs in are due primarily to a charge to the allowance for doubtful accounts  which was in addition to the million sales reserve necessitated by the length of time involved in obtaining medicare coverage  a charge incurred in the transition to a new chief executive officer  and non routine legal expenses related to patent defense 
while selling  general and administrative expense levels were relatively consistent with  they included a realignment of critical sales positions  the addition of a new executive vice president of worldwide sales and marketing  and the transition to a new chief executive officer 
spending in and also included new product start up and launch related expenses not incurred in interest and other income expense 
interest and other income were   and  in  and  respectively 
interest income  and the annual fluctuations  are a result of investment balances from proceeds from private placements of our common stock 
interest and other expense were   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense from through is due to the addition of a revolving credit line and an equipment term loan 
income taxes 
as of december   we had federal and california net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
additionally  we had foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million 
the federal net operating loss carry forwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
the california net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change rules provided by the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating losses before utilization 
our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future from year to year as well as from quarter to quarter 
revenues may fluctuate as a result of actions relating to regulatory and reimbursement matters  the success of our fee per use program and the extent to which the tuna system gains market acceptance 
operating expenses may fluctuate as a result of several factors  including 
the timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  
costs of clinical activities  and 
research and develop and selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the potential growth of our organization 
fluctuations in operating results could have a material adverse effect on our business by  among other things  disrupting our cash flow  limiting our ability to attract investors and impairing our ability to implement long range plans 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will achieve profitability 
if profitability is achieved  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain profitable operations 
liquidity and capital resources as we began fiscal  we believed that our current cash balances  projected cash flows from operations  including our newly introduced fee per use program  and cash available under our financing facility would be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements through the end of the year 
although quarterly revenues generated by the fee per use program increased since its inception  experience has shown that the fee per use program will take longer to implement than originally planned 
in an effort to increase revenues  we believe that it is necessary to 
increase the number of physicians who perform tuna procedures  
implement marketing initiatives to assist physicians in building their practices by increasing the number of tuna procedures performed  and 
increase consumer awareness of the treatment options available to bph patients with the view that an informed patient and his doctor are more likely to choose the tuna procedure 
the increased costs associated with this three pronged approach together with lower than anticipated revenues from the fee per use program in required us to obtain additional financing to meet our current operating and capital requirements 
in october and november  we sold million shares of common stock at a price of per share in a private placement  resulting in net proceeds of approximately  in january  we sold million shares of common stock at a price of per share in a private placement for net proceeds of approximately  in october  we obtained a million debt facility with transamerica technology finance  a division of transamerica corporation 
the facility is secured by our assets and consists of a revolving accounts receivable based credit line of up to million and a million equipment term loan 
in connection with the debt facility  we issued transamerica a year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the term loan was funded in full as of december   at an interest rate of per year 
repayment of that loan is amortized over a three year period  with the first monthly payment having been made in december as of december   we owed  under the equipment term loan 
as of december   we borrowed approximately  against the revolving accounts receivable based line at a rate of per year 
the revolving credit line has a minimum interest payment of  per year 
on october   we entered into an amendment and waiver agreement with transamerica 
under that agreement  transamerica waived an event of default under our loan and security agreement resulting from the inclusion of a going concern uncertainty paragraph in an updated opinion from our independent auditors regarding our fiscal financial statements 
in consideration for the waiver  we paid transamerica a  fee and issued a warrant to acquire to  shares of our common stock for a purchase price of per share 
the warrant has a term of five years 
in january  we renewed our debt facility with transamerica and in consideration of this renewal paid a  fee and issued a warrant to transamerica to acquire an additional  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the warrant has a term of years 
the shares of common stock underlying all of the warrants issued to transamerica have been registered for resale 
management believes that the proceeds of the equity and debt financings described above  together with existing cash and anticipated revenues from the fee per use program  will be sufficient to fund operations at current levels through the end of year our actual capital requirements  however  will depend on many factors  including the rate of increase in the number of hospitals that perform tuna procedures  the rate of increase in the number of procedures performed at hospitals where our equipment has been placed  the cost of promoting the program  competition in the marketplace  our ability to expand the fee per use program to doctors offices and ambulatory surgery centers when or if medicare approves reimbursement for the costs of tuna procedures performed in those locations and the amount of reimbursement provided for procedures performed outside of hospitals 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement  which is required to be adopted in the first quarter of the year ending december  management does not anticipate that the adoption of statement will have a significant effect on our results of operations or our financial position 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab summarizes certain areas of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we believe that our current revenue recognition principles comply with sab year in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems and we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems 
we did not incur any material expenditures in in connection with remediating our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
however  there can be no assurance that we have fully and accurately assessed our year readiness or of the effectiveness of our corrective actions 
nor can there be any assurance that our customers  suppliers and vendors fully and accurately assessed their year readiness or of the effectiveness of their corrective actions 
accordingly  we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our customers  suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
cautionary statements regarding future operations the cautionary statements that follow are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect the financial condition and results of operations of vidamed 
they are not meant to be an exhaustive or complete discussion of the risks our company faces and they should be read in conjunction with the discussions of factors appearing elsewhere in this report  in vidamed s other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in materials incorporated by reference in those filings 
our current cash resources are limited and we may have difficulty raising capital in the future 
although quarterly revenues generated by the fee per use program have been increasing since its inception  experience has shown that the program will take longer to implement than originally planned 
the number of hospitals equipped to perform tuna procedures has not increased as rapidly as expected and the number of tuna procedures being performed at hospitals where our equipment has been placed is lower than expected 
costs to promote the program were higher than expected and we required additional funding to maintain current operating levels through december  because of the shortage of operating funds  our independent auditors amended their opinion  issued in connection with the financial statements included in our amended annual report on form k a filed with the securities and exchange commission for our fiscal year  to include an explanatory fourth paragraph expressing substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
management believes that the proceeds of the recent equity and debt financings together with existing cash and anticipated revenues from the fee per use program will be sufficient to fund operations through the end of the year however  this forecast is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
the factors described above under liquidity and capital resources will affect our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
we may have to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot be certain that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
furthermore  additional equity financing will dilute the interests of our current stockholders and may depress the market price of our stock 
additional debt financing may be available  but management believes it would be limited in amount  may involve restrictive covenants  and would be costly because it would be subordinate to our secured financing facility with transamerica business credit corporation 
we may be able to obtain additional debt financing from transamerica  but we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to do so or that the terms of the financing would be favorable 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if additional financing is needed but unavailable  management nonetheless believes that it would be able to conserve cash by scaling back research and development  clinical trials  expansion into the office based and ambulatory surgery center markets and otherareas of discretionary spending 
reductions in those areas  however  could have a material adverse effect on our long term opportunities to develop new and competitive products  obtain necessary governmental approvals of those products and develop additional markets for our products 
we have a history of operating losses and we expect operating losses to continue 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses through the end of the year as we expend substantial funds on sales and marketing activities  fund clinical trials in support of reimbursement approvals and fund research and development 
our profitability depends on numerous factors  including 
our success in promoting the fee per use program  
our success in achieving market acceptance of the tuna procedure  
our success in obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory clearances  
the extent to which medicare and other healthcare payors approve reimbursement of the costs of tuna procedures performed in hospitals  doctors offices and ambulatory surgery centers  and 
the amount of reimbursement provided 
the tuna procedure is a new therapy and may not be accepted by physicians  patients and healthcare payors 
physicians will not recommend the tuna procedure unless they conclude  based on clinical data and other factors  that it is an effective alternative to other methods of enlarged prostate treatment  including more established methods 
in particular  physicians may elect not to recommend the tuna procedure until the long term duration of the relief provided by the procedure has been established 
clinical data for assessing the durability of relief provided by the tuna therapy in the united states does not extend beyond five years 
some physicians may consider five years of clinical data to be sufficient evidence of durability and others may not 
as time passes since the first tuna procedures were performed  and as more procedures are performed  the clinical data will continue to be developed 
we are in the process of conducting multi year patient follow up studies to assess the durability of the relief provided by the tuna procedure 
even if the clinical efficacy of the tuna procedure is established  physicians may elect not to recommend the procedure unless acceptable reimbursement from healthcare payors is available 
healthcare payor acceptance of the tuna procedure will require evidence of its cost effectiveness compared with other therapies for enlarged prostate  which will depend in large part on the duration of the relief provided by the tuna procedure 
patient acceptance of the procedure will depend in part on physician recommendations and in part on other factors  including the degree of invasiveness and the rate and severity of complications associated with the procedure compared with other therapies  and the ability to educate patients of their treatment choices 
if coverage is not approved for procedures performed outside of hospitals  or if the amount of coverage is inadequate  we will not be able to achieve widespread acceptance of the tuna therapy 
to achieve widespread acceptance of the tuna therapy  we believe that reimbursement will need to be available for procedures performed outside of the hospital setting  in doctors offices and ambulatory surgery centers 
in addition  the amount of reimbursement for tuna procedures performed in those locations must be adequate 
medicare has not yet approved reimbursement for the costs of supplies  equipment and overhead outside of hospital settings 
in  medicare announced that it would delay consideration of coverage in doctors offices and ambulatory surgery centers while it reviewed its year compliance issues 
medicare is now behind schedule in many areas  and we do not expect that coverage for procedures performed at these alternative sites will be approved until at least mid to late when and if reimbursement is approved  it most likely will be subject to a prospective payment system 
under this system  ambulatory surgery centers and doctors offices will be allowed a flat rate of reimbursement for each tuna procedure performed  and will need to manage their costs of supplies  equipment and overhead to fit within the approved payment 
the amount of reimbursement allowed for a tuna procedure under a prospective payment system has not been determined 
as a result of these factors  we can give no assurance that procedures performed in doctors offices and ambulatory surgery centers will generate significant revenue for us in the united states at least during the year if coverage becomes available for procedures performed in doctors offices and ambulatory surgery centers  we expect that the number of procedures performed will increase 
the amount of reimbursement could decrease  however  and the decrease could be substantial 
we cannot predict whether the amount of reimbursement  when and if it is approved  will be deemed adequate by physicians and patients or whether our revenues from procedures performed outside of hospitals will be sufficient to cover our operating expenses 
our future revenues and profitability are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reimbursement and reform 
the continuing efforts of government and insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability 
in the united states  given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care  the us congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform including the reform of medicare and medicaid systems  and on the cost of medical products and services 
our ability to commercialize the tuna procedure successfully will depend in part on the extent to which the users of our products obtain appropriate reimbursement for the cost of the tuna procedure 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states and the concurrent growth of organizations such as hmos  which could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our products 
the cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could cause reductions in the amount of reimbursement available to users of our products  and could materially adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
we sell one product line and our revenues will suffer if there is a disruption in the supply of components 
the vidamed tuna system consists of a radio frequency generator  a reusable handle  a disposable cartridge and an optical telescope 
if a material problem develops with any one or more of those components  our revenues would likely suffer because we do not have other products to rely on 
possible problems include  but are not necessarily limited to  malfunctions  failure to comply with or changes in governmental regulations  product recalls  product obsolescence  injunctions resulting from litigation  inability to protect our intellectual property  invalidity of our patents or shortages of one or more of the components of the system 
we rely on contract manufacturers for the majority of our manufacturing 
we outsource the manufacture of the disposable cartridge and most other components of the tuna system  and we rely on contract manufacturers to supply our components in sufficient quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  product recalls  quality control and assurance  component supply and lack of qualified personnel 
if any of our manufacturers experience any production problems  we may not be able to locate an alternate manufacturer promptly 
delays in production could adversely affect the success of our fee per use program and our future revenues 
our rights to inventions of our founder are limited to the field of urology 
the proprietary information agreement between vidamed and stuart d 
edwards  one of our company s founders  obligates mr 
edwards to assign to vidamed his inventions and related intellectual property only in the field of urology 
mr 
edwards has assigned to a third party his inventions in the cancer field 
mr 
edwards has also conceived of and may continue to conceive of  various medical device product concepts for other fields outside of urology  including certain product concepts for the treatment of snoring and sleep apnea and others in the gynecology and internal medicine field  all of which have been assigned to unrelated third parties 
we may fail to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trade secret law to protect the technology in our products 
we hold numerous us and foreign patents and patent applications relating to our products 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how which we seek to protect in part through proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and others 
these agreements typically provide that all materials and confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and cannot be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances and that all inventions arising out of the relationship with vidamed shall be our exclusive property 
these agreements may be breached  and in some instances  we may not have an appropriate remedy available for the breach 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology 
the steps we take may be inadequate to protect our rights in our proprietary technology 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of a third party s proprietary rights 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could subject us to liabilities 
the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
we are aware of patents held by other participants in our market  and there can be no assurance that we will not in the future become subject to patent infringement claims and litigation or united states patent and trademark office interference proceedings 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time consuming 
these proceedings could also result in significant diversion of the time and attention of our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that necessary licenses would be available on satisfactory terms or at all 
an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business exposes us to product liability claims 
use of our products involves an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against us 
although we are insured against such risks up to a million annual aggregate limit  our present product liability insurance may be inadequate 
a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any successful product liability claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable or reasonable terms 
in addition  product liability insurance may cease to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost 
an inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage could prevent or inhibit the marketing and sale of our products 
a product liability claim could result in a recall of the product by the fda and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  business  financial condition and results of operations 
exercise of outstanding warrants and options will dilute existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our stock 
as of february   we had issued and outstanding approximately million shares of common stock and outstanding warrants and options to purchase approximately million additional shares of common stock 
the existence of the outstanding options and warrants may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the terms under which we could obtain additional equity capital 
the exercise of the options and warrants will dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders 
the million outstanding options and warrants include i options to purchase a total of approximately million shares granted to our employees  officers  directors and consultants under various stock option plans  ii warrants to purchase up to approximately million shares of common stock issued to investors who purchased common stock from us in a private placement in january  and iii warrants to purchase a total of approximately million shares issued to other investors 
in addition  we have reserved approximately million shares of common stock for future issuance under employee and director stock option plans  and our employee stock purchase plan 
if we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market  our stock could become subject to the sec s penny stock rules  making it difficult to sell 
in december  the nasdaq amex market group notified us that the listing of our common stock would be transferred from the national market to the smallcap market 
the transfer occurred because we did not satisfy the minimum net tangible asset listing requirement of the national market and because our independent auditors included a going concern uncertainty paragraph in the opinion they issued in connection with our amended annual report on form k a for the fiscal year ended december  management believes that vidamed can satisfy the continued listing requirements of the smallcap market for the foreseeable future  but if one or more of the risks described herein were to occur  our listing could be jeopardized 
if we were to lose our smallcap market listing  our common stock would likely trade in the over the counter markets through the pink sheets or on the nasdaq s otc bulletin board 
in addition  our stock could become subject to the penny stock rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission 
these rules provide that a company s stock will be considered a penny stock if it is not listed on a national securities exchange or nasdaq and its trading price is below per share 
the rules impose several sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and investors who meet certain high net worth and income standards 
broker dealers executing transactions in penny stocks must make special suitability determinations for purchasers and receive each purchaser s written agreement prior to the transaction 
consequently  the rules may adversely affect the ability of broker dealers to sell penny stocks and the ability of stockholders to sell their shares in the secondary market 
the volatility of our stock price may limit our ability to obtain additional financing 
the market price of our common stock has historically been highly volatile and could be materially and adversely affected if any of the risks described herein were to occur 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to our operating performance 
the broad market fluctuations and the volatility of our stock may adversely affect its market price and impair our ability to obtain future funding from the sale of our common or preferred stock 
competitors have greater resources and may develop better products 
although there is a large market for the treatment of men suffering from enlarged prostate  there are a number of therapies competing for market share 
competition in the market for minimally invasive devices to treat this condition has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase 
the relative speed with which we can develop products  complete clinical testing and regulatory approval processes  secure third party reimbursement and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than ours  which allows them to have larger technical  research  marketing  and sales and distribution programs 
if competitors are able to develop superior products  or are better able to market their products  we may not be successful in commercializing our products and marketing and sales programs 
us governmental regulation may impair our ability to compete 
the manufacture and distribution of our products are subject to continuous governmental review 
in addition  new products or substantial modifications to our existing product generally must be cleared by the fda before they can be introduced to the marketplace 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in 
fines  
injunctions  
civil penalties  
recall or seizure of products  
total or partial suspension of production  
failure of the government to grant approval for devices  and or 
criminal prosecution 
medical devices are classified into one of three classes  class i  ii or iii  on the basis of the controls necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness 
safety and effectiveness can be ensured for class i devices through general controls such as labeling  pre market notification and adherence to good manufacturing practices and for class ii devices through the use of special controls such as performance standards  post market surveillance  patient registries  and fda guidelines 
generally  class iii devices are those which must receive pre market approval by the fda to ensure their safety and effectiveness such as life sustaining  life supporting and implantable devices  or new devices that have not been found substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices 
the fda has cleared vidamed s tuna system as a class ii device 
before a new device or a substantial modification to an existing product can be introduced into the market  the manufacturer must generally obtain fda clearance 
clearance through a pre market notification will be granted if the submitted data establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or ii medical device  or to a class iii medical device for which the fda has not called for a pre market approval 
the fda may determine that a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  or that additional data is needed before a substantial equivalency determination can be made 
a determination that the proposed device is not substantially equivalent  or a request for additional data  could delay the market introduction of new products that fall into this category 
if we are required to obtain clearance in the future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so within a commercially reasonable time  if at all 
foreign governmental regulation may impair our ability to compete 
foreign regulations governing the sale of medical devices outside of the united states vary widely from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval for sale in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required in the united states and the requirements may differ 
although we have received regulatory approvals where required for commercial sale of the tuna system in all major international markets  the requirements to maintain those approvals could change  or new approvals could be necessary as we develop new products or modify existing products 
we have received certifications that allow us to affix the ce mark to the tuna system  permitting us to market and sell the tuna system in all countries of the european economic area 
additional product approvals from foreign regulatory authorities may be required for international sale of the general electro surgical components of the tuna system 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in loss of previously received approvals and other sanctions 
our previous distributor in japan  century medical  inc  has been responsible for managing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory and reimbursement approvals for the tuna system in japan 
regulatory approval in japan was received from the japanese ministry of health and welfare in july for our previous generation product 
approval by the japanese ministry of health was granted for the new model generator and provu system in august failure to obtain market acceptance for the tuna procedure in japan could preclude the commercial viability of our products in japan and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we agreed with century medical to terminate our business relationship  and in january entered into a new distribution agreement with mc medical  a subsidiary of mitsubishi 
all regulatory approvals and distribution rights are in the process of being transferred to mc medical and in compliance with japanese law the relationship with century medical will not terminate until all regulatory transfers are completed and effective  which we anticipate to be in may item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates primarily to the investment of our excess cash in marketable securities 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
our policy is to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we have no investments denominated in foreign currencies and therefore are not subject to foreign exchange risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
as of december   our investments consisted of us government securities with maturities of less than ninety days
