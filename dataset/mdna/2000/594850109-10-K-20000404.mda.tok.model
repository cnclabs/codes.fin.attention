item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and resultsof operations this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk related factors set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
results of operations overview micro linear corporation was founded in micro linear currently serves the communications  industrial and computer markets with a broad range of standard products for a variety of applications  including local area networks  video  telecommunications  power management  battery management  motor control 
the company utilizes three principal manufacturing process technologies  bipolar  cmos and bicmos 
in recent years  sales of communications products  including networking and telecom  have constituted a majority of the company s revenues 
specifically  such products represented approximately  and of net revenues for   and  respectively 
the communications market is characterized by intense competition  relatively short product life cycles and rapid technological change 
in addition  the communications market has undergone rapid growth and consolidation in the last few years 
the company s net revenues and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected in the event of a slowdown in this market 
the company is attempting to reduce its dependency on the communications industry through various means  such as expanding its product mix and customer base 
the company s communications market includes networking applications 
a substantial portion of the company s net revenues are derived from sales of products for computer networking applications 
sales of the company s products to network equipment manufacturers accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues in and accounted for of the company s top selling products for these products constituted approximately of the company s revenues for the same period 
the computer networking equipment market is characterized by intense competition  relatively short product life cycles and rapid technological change 
in addition  the computer network equipment market has undergone a period of rapid growth and experienced consolidation among the competitors in the market in recent years 
although the company has expanded its product mix and customer base  the company expects its dependency on sales to network equipment manufacturers to continue into the company s business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant slowdown in the computer networking equipment market 
in addition  as a result of competitive pricing pressures  the company has experienced lower margins in certain of its existing products for computer networking applications 
there can be no assurance as to when or if such pricing pressure will lessen 
such pricing pressures will have an adverse affect on the company s results of operations unless they can be offset by higher margins on other products or reduced operating expenses 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and other fluctuations which may result from the timing and extent of process development costs  changes in the mix of products sold  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  the availability and cost of wafers from outside foundries  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  and competitive pricing pressures 
other factors which may result in operating fluctuations are the company s ability to access advanced process technologies  the ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  the timing of new product announcements and cyclical semiconductor industry conditions 
moreover  the company s business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  the company expects to continue to experience material fluctuations in its future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
annual results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative legal settlement and related cost total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income  net income loss before provision for taxes provision benefits for taxes net income loss net revenues net revenues were million for  million for and million for net revenues in decreased from net revenues in  and net revenues decreased from the company serves three principal markets  computer  communications and industrial 
net revenues for compared to increased in the computer market and in the industrial market and decreased in the communications market 
net revenues for compared to increased in the industrial market and decreased and in the communications market and computer market respectively 
the communications market includes the computer networking equipment networking sub market 
revenues in the networking sub market for were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues for and million  or of net revenues for the networking sub market is characterized by intense competition  relatively short product life cycles and rapid technological change 
in addition  the networking sub market has undergone a period of rapid growth  price erosion and consolidation in recent years 
although the company has expanded its product mix and customer base  the company expects its dependency on sales to network equipment manufacturers to continue 
the company s business and results of operations have been and will be adversely affected by a significant slowdown in the computer networking equipment sub market 
international revenues for totaled million or of net revenues compared to million or of net revenues for and million or of net revenues for the moderate decrease in international revenues in compared to and decrease in compared to was due to a combination of lower demand for the company s products in asia and decreased asia pacific subcontract work for domestic customers 
domestic distributor revenues were approximately of net revenues for  compared to for and for the company defers recognition of revenue derived from sales to distributors until such distributors resell the products to their customers 
gross margin the company s gross margin is affected by the volume of product sales  price  product mix  manufacturing utilization  product yields and the mix of sales to oem s and to distributors 
gross margin is periodically affected by costs incurred in connection with start up and installation of new process technologies at outside manufacturing foundries 
gross margin increased slightly to in from in due primarily to lower costs and better production yields 
gross margin declined from in  primarily due to a shift of product mix to lower margin products  lower levels of production and lower average selling prices related to competitive pricing pressures 
the company s gross margin is affected by costs associated with installing new processes at its foundries 
the company has been able to mitigate the effect on gross margin associated with new wafer manufacturing process costs by relying upon process technologies existing at its outside wafer foundries 
the costs of new processes installed in and related to the closure of an internal bipolar fabrication facility are discussed below 
the cost of additional new processes installed in  unrelated to the closure of the bipolar fabrication facility  were approximately million 
the company currently purchases its wafers from six wafer suppliers 
a substantial majority of the company s wafer supply is obtained from three wafer suppliers 
the company s products are assembled and packaged by four vendors 
supply interruptions due to such factors as inadequate capacity or raw material shortages at the company s wafer suppliers or assembly vendors could materially and adversely affect product shipments 
the company purchases most of its bicmos wafers from one wafer foundry in taiwan 
accordingly  the company s bicmos wafer supply could be materially and adversely affected if this foundry is unable to meet the company s supply requirements 
the company closed its owned bipolar fabrication facility in the fourth quarter of production related to this fabrication facility has been moved to an outside foundry resulting in lower wafer costs 
the cost of closing the operation  including asset disposal  inventory write off  facility clean up and new foundry qualification totaled million 
of this amount approximately million was expensed in the amount expensed in included new foundry qualification costs and installation costs of new process technologies of million and an inventory write off of approximately million 
additional foundry qualification costsand installation costs of new process technologies of approximately million were incurred and expensed in the net book value of fixed assets disposed totaled  in these assets were sold for approximately  research and development expenses research and development expenses include costs associated with the definition  design and development of standard and semi standard products  tile arrays and standard cells 
in addition  research and development expenses include test development and prototype assembly costs associated with new product development 
the company also expenses prototype wafers and new production mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until products based on new designs are fully characterized by the company and are demonstrated to support published data sheets and satisfy reliability tests 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success 
research and development expenses such as mask and silicon costs that are related to the development of new products can fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the product design process 
research and development expenses were million for or of net revenues compared to million or of net revenues in and million or of net revenues in research and development expenses in increased over the increase in is primarily attributable to the addition of personnel associated with the company s development center in cambridge  england and the addition of a new design center in livingston  scotland 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million for or of net revenues compared to million or of net revenues in and million or of net revenues in the decrease in compared to is primarily attributable to lower staffing  patent and advertising costs 
the decrease in compared to is primarily attributable to a decrease in sales commissions resulting from lower net revenues and decreased business conference costs 
legal settlement and related costs the financial results in fiscal include a pre tax charge of million associated with the settlement of a legal claim 
of the total million  million was for the legal settlement and the remaining million was for legal services related to the case 
interest and other income and interest expense interest and other income was million for  million for and million for interest income is affected by changes in the company s cash balances as well as prevailing interest rates 
interest expense was million in and million in and provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate was negative for and for and the effective tax rates differ from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and federal research credits 
liquidity and capital resources the company has in recent years financed its operations and capital requirements principally through cash flow from operations 
operations provided million of net cash during  a decrease of million from the decrease in is primarily attributable to lower net income and decreased accrued liabilities partially offset by lower inventory and higher ccounts payable at the end of cash used in investing activities for is attributable to capital expenditures of million and the net purchase of short term investments of million 
financing activities for consist primarily of the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock for million 
from january through the end of  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million 
the company terminated the share repurchase program at the end of the first quarter of the company received million from the sale of common stock issued under the employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
working capital was million at december  which includes cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
the company anticipates that its existing cash resources and cash generated from operations will fund necessary purchases of capital equipment and provide adequate working capital for at least the next twelve months 
the company s liquidity is affected by many factors  including  among others  the extent to which the company pursues additional wafer fabrication capacity from existing foundry suppliers or new suppliers  capital expenditures  and the level of the company s product development efforts  and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require the company to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
other factors affecting future operating results the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect revenues and profitability  including the company s access to advanced process technologies  the timing and extent of process development costs  the company s ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the volume and timing of orders received  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  changes in the mix of products sold  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  the availability and cost of wafers from outside foundries  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  competitive pricing pressures and cyclical semiconductor industry conditions 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry have decreased over the life of any particular product 
competitive pricing pressures are expected to continue in the future  especially in the communications market  and may have a material adverse effect on the company s gross margin 
the company s business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
due to the absence of substantial noncancellable backlog  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions 
to remain competitive  the company must develop or obtain access to advanced semiconductor process technologies in order to reduce die size  increase die performance and functional complexity  and improve yields 
semiconductor design and process methodologies are subject to rapid technological change  requiring large expenditures for research and development 
if the company is unable to develop or obtain access to advanced wafer processing technologies as they become needed  or is unable to define  design  develop and introduce competitive new products on a timely basis  its future operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  if the company is unable to transfer and install such new process technologies to one or more of its foundries in a timely manner  its business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  significant price erosion  periods of over capacity and production shortages  variations in manufacturing costs and yields and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
the industry has from time to time experienced depressed business conditions 
the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions or other factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   the company s investment portfolio consisted of us government obligations and commercial paper of million  typically with maturities of less than months see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these securities  like all us government obligations and commercial paper  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
additionally  the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  the company would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in income or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk the company s inventory purchase and product sales transactions are almost all denominated in us dollars 
the company has international sales and research and development facilities and is  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
the company s foreign currency risks are mitigated principally by maintaining only minimal foreign currency balances 
to date  the exposure to the company related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant 
if the foreign currency rates fluctuate by from rates at december   the effect on the company s financial position and results of operations would not be material 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future
