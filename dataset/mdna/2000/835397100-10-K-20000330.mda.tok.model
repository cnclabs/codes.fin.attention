item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information set forth in this item below contains forward looking statements designated by an  and the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors  including those set forth above under additional risk factors 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and market innovative medical devices that utilize our proprietary temperature controlled radiofrequency technology for the treatment of upper airway disorders 
our somnoplasty system provides physicians with a suite of products designed to offer minimally invasive  curative treatment alternatives for disorders of the upper airway  including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome  osas  chronic turbinate hypertrophy and habitual snoring 
our operations in and consisted largely of research and development  product engineering  seeking clearance of our products from the food drug administration fda  development of a direct sales force in the united states and internationally  and training international distributor employees for distribution of the somnoplasty system in the european union eu  australia  southeast asia and certain other areas 
we commercially introduced the somnoplasty system internationally  beginning in june one month later  after receiving k clearance from the fda for the use of the somnoplasty system to treat habitual snoring  we began direct sales of the somnoplasty system in the united states 
we received fda clearance to treat chronic turbinate hypertrophy in december and osas in november during the third quarter of fiscal we established a european headquarters in the netherlands 
during  we continued to build our direct sales force in the united states 
presently  the sales force consists of a vice president of sales and marketing  two domestic regional sales managers  ten domestic sales representatives  one independent representative group and three clinical specialists 
during  we hired a vice president and general manager of european sales and marketing to manage distributors in european countries 
during the fourth quarter of  we hired a director of international sales to manage our distributors in countries other than the united states and europe 
we anticipate significant short term expenditures in the development of our direct and indirect sales infrastructure 
product shipments of control units and disposable devices are made directly from our facility in sunnyvale  california to domestic customers and international distributors 
as the company s sales have grown  the dollar volume of products has shifted from a mix of about percent control units and percent disposables during to a mix of about percent control units and percent disposables during the fourth quarter of we plan to continue to hire additional management and engineering personnel to support and develop manufacturing expertise and larger scale manufacturing capacity expansion as required to support the current and anticipated growth 
additionally  we will invest in further production equipment  vertical integration and facility expansion to reduce manufacturing costs  reduce manufacturing cycle time and increase production capacity 
personnel hires and capital expenditures will require operating capital on an ongoing basis 
we will continue to expand our internal reporting capabilities and further strengthen systems to manage our expanding business 
this current and anticipated significant growth of our personnel  sales and scope of operations may place considerable strain on our management  financial  manufacturing and other capabilities  procedures and controls 
there can be no assurance that any existing or additional capabilities  procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations or that our capabilities  procedures or controls will be designed  implemented or improved in a timely and cost effective manner 
failure to implement  improve and expand such capabilities  procedures and controls in an efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we have incurred cumulative losses from inception of approximately  moreover  we expect to incur significant additional operating losses over the next couple of years primarily due to the development of our manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities along with ongoing research and development efforts  including clinical studies and expenses associated with our patent portfolio  as well as due to costs associated with the implementation of the appropriate infrastructure to support and grow the business operations 
our limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
future revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year and will depend upon numerous factors  including the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  the scale up of manufacturing capabilities  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  competition  the timing and success of new product introductions by us or our competitors  the timing of regulatory clearances or approvals of those new products and our ability to market our products in the united states and internationally 
accordingly  interim period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of likely future performance or annual operating results 
our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected in the event that we are unable to market the somnoplasty system effectively  anticipate customer demand accurately or effectively manage new product launches  pricing and cost containment pressures in health care 
our operations and financial results could also be significantly affected by international factors  including oversight by numerous regulatory agencies  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and foreign economic and political conditions 
results of operations net revenues our revenues for and were derived primarily from sales of our somnoplasty system  consisting of the control units and disposable devices  to private practices  hospitals  clinics and sleep clinics 
net revenues increased in to  from  in and  in the year over year increase was  or percent from to and  or percent from to these increases were due to both the increased sale of control units  boosted by the introduction of the new s control unit during the third quarter of and increased disposable handpiece shipments driven off the higher installed base and an increased use of disposable devices per control unit 
during  about percent of net revenues were attributable to sales to customers in the united states and about percent from europe and the rest of the world 
this compares with about percent domestic sales in  with europe and the rest of the world about percent 
traditionally  the sale of control units has been the major part of our total revenues 
in about percent of our domestic revenue came from the sale of control units  with disposable handpieces representing about percent 
in  only percent of our domestic revenue represented sales of control units  with disposable handpieces representing percent of revenue 
in the fourth quarter of  handpieces represented about percent of total sales compared to the fourth quarter of where disposables represented percent of revenue 
we expect disposable devices to increase as a percentage of total revenue  year over year  as we implement sales programs that reduce the price of control units 
cost of sales and gross profit cost of sales consists of raw materials  subassemblies and completed electronics  quality assurance and warranty costs 
our gross profit increased to  in  or percent gross margin  from  representing a percent gross margin in during  our initial year of product sales  we sustained a negative gross profit of  due to manufacturing start up costs 
during and increased volume and cost reduction efforts contributed to better efficiency in our manufacturing process 
cost of sales included a one time charge of approximately  relating to certain manufacturing process issues which were experienced in the fourth quarter of we believe that cost of sales will increase in absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues depending on volume and product mix 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for were  compared to  for the prior year  a decrease of  or percent 
research and development expenses are comprised of salaries  prototype development costs  costs associated with intellectual property  and clinical trial and regulatory approval expenses 
the decrease in expenses was primarily due to a shifting of focus over a wide range of activities 
we reduced clinical trial expenses by  reduced prototype and engineering expenses by  intellectual property and patent expenses by  and lowered personnel costs in the research and development category by  these lower expenses resulted principally from our previously receiving fda approval for three indications and the introduction of our s control unit in  thus reducing our activity in research and development 
from to our research and development expenses increased from  to  this increase of  or percent was primarily due to increased salaries and employee related expenses of  in versus  in  increased consulting fees of  compared to  and increased patent legal expenses of  versus  in the prior year period 
selling  marketing  general and administrative selling  marketing  general and administrative sg a expenses for were  compared to  for a decrease of approximately   or percent 
sg a expenses consist of sales salaries  sales and marketing expenses  executive salaries  professional fees including consulting  accounting  legal and risk management  facilities overhead  accounting and human resources and general office administration expenses 
the decrease in sg a from to results from a decrease in one time charges incurred in of approximately  in connection with the transition of our former chief executive officer and chairman of the board to chief technical officer and board director  severance of our former chief financial officer and certain other executives  offset by increased advertising expenses of about  and increased investment in the european sales effort of about  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for were  compared to  for  an increase of approximately  or percent  including approximately  in one time charges in the other increases in sg a costs are primarily due to increased salaries and employee related expenses of  due to increased headcount  higher levels of commission on higher sales volumes  and the opening of the european headquarters 
interest and other income interest and other income for was  compared to  for and  for the increase from to is attributable to interest income earned by somnus on an increased outstanding balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  invested from the proceeds of the ipo 
in interest income decreased as invested cash balances decreased 
interest expense was for  compared to  in and  in the decrease was due to the repayment of borrowings under the equipment lease line of credit 
net loss the net loss was  for   for  and  for we expect that our operating losses will continue for at least the next couple of years  as we continue to invest substantial resources in product development  manufacturing  sales  marketing and infrastructure development 
income taxes as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
we also had federal and california research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year through  if not utilized 
the state of california net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
the deferred tax asset on the balance sheet has been fully offset by a valuation allowances 
impact of year in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
liquidity and capital resources since inception through december   somnus has financed its operations primarily through the private placement of equity securities  bank loans  lease lines of credit  stockholder loans and our november  ipo 
from inception  we raised approximately  in net proceeds from private equity financing 
we raised an additional  from our ipo  net of costs of  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were  compared to  at december  net cash used in operating activities was approximately  for the year ended december   compared to  for and  in net cash used in operating activities differs from our net loss for these comparison periods primarily due to non cash charges associated with the amortization of deferred compensation  the depreciation of property and equipment  and other changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities for capital expenditures was approximately  for  compared to  for and  for net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for the year ended december   compared to  for and  in this was due to the exercise of stock options of approximately  in and  in the net cash provided by financing activities for the twelve months ended december  primarily included the issuance of preferred stock  borrowings under a lease line of credit and proceeds from our ipo 
during  the company repurchased  of its common stock 
we recorded deferred stock compensation expense for the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of our common stock for certain options granted and related to the severance of former executives including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer 
the total unamortized deferred stock compensation at december  is  we amortized deferred compensation expenses of approximately  in the twelve months ended december  compared to  and  for the respective and periods 
the remainder of the deferred stock compensation will be amortized over the corresponding vesting period of each respective option  which is generally four years from date of original issuance 
at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of  in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
there were no other material unused sources of liquid assets at december  we currently anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements will be approximately million for the next twelve months 
these requirements relate primarily to the acquisition of additional leasehold improvements  manufacturing equipment  computer hardware and software to handle anticipated manufacturing expansion and headcount additions 
in october  we announced that our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program permitting the purchase of up to  shares  at up to per share  of our common stock in the open market 
no shares had been repurchased by somnus as of december  during the company purchased  shares for a total of  under the program 
we anticipate that our existing resources will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations at least through the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional funding prior to such time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the ability of somnus to establish and maintain strategic distributor relationships  the time and cost in obtaining regulatory clearances  competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing and other factors 
there can be no assurance that additional financing to meet our funding requirements will be available as needed 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
insufficient funds may require somnus to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish rights to products at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise seek to obtain or to scale back and eliminate certain sales and marketing initiatives 
the failure of somnus to raise capital when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shift in the interest rates we invest in short term securities and have maintained an average maturity of about months and a maximum maturity of months 
due to the nature of short term investments we have concluded that we do not have a material market risk exposure
