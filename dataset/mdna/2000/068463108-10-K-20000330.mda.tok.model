the company s revenues represent all amounts billed to customers for direct payroll  related employment taxes  workers compensation coverage and a service fee equivalent to a mark up percentage 
the company s oregon and california offices accounted for approximately of its total revenues in consequently  weakness in economic conditions in these regions could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results

the company also maintains a large deductible workers compensation insurance policy for employees working in states where the company is not currently self insured 
safety incentives represent cash incentives paid to certain peo client companies for maintaining safe work practices in order to minimize workplace injuries 
the incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined workers compensation claims cost objectives 
the largest portion of workers compensation expense is the cost of workplace injury claims 
when an injury occurs and is reported to the company  the company s respective independent third party claims administrator tpa analyzes the details of the injury and develops a case reserve  which is the tpa s estimate of the cost of the claim based on similar injuries and its professional judgment 
the company then records  or accrues  an expense and a corresponding liability based upon the tpa s estimates for claims reserves 
as cash payments are made by the company s tpa against specific case reserves  the accrued liability is reduced by the corresponding payment amount 
the tpa also reviews existing injury claims on an on going basis and adjusts the case reserves as new or additional information for each claim becomes available 
the company has established additional reserves to provide for future unanticipated increases in expenses adverse loss development of the claims reserves for open injury claims and for claims incurred but not reported related to prior and current periods 
management believes that the company s internal claims reporting system minimizes the occurrence of unreported incurred claims

in addition  included  of merger expenses related to the company s june pooling of interests merger with western industrial management  inc basic and diluted earnings per share for were 
as compared to 
for both basic and diluted earnings per share for revenues for totaled  an increase of approximately  or over revenues of  the increase in total revenues was primarily due to the tss  tpm and tsu acquisitions  which were consummated in the first half of the internal growth rate for revenues was for  although it improved to for the fourth quarter of staffing services revenue increased  or  while professional employer services revenue increased  or  which resulted in an increase in the share of staffing services to of total revenues for  as compared to for the increase in staffing services revenue for was primarily attributable to the three acquisitions made during the share of professional employer services revenues had a corresponding decrease from of total revenues for to for gross margin for totaled  which represented an increase of  or over the gross margin percent increased from of revenues for to for the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to lower payroll taxes and benefits for  primarily attributable to lower state unemployment tax rates in certain states in which the company does business 
the company expects gross margin  as a percentage of revenues  to continue to be influenced by fluctuations in the mix between staffing and peo services  as well as the adequacy of its estimates for workers compensation liabilities  which may be negatively affected by unanticipated adverse loss development of claims reserves 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of compensation and other expenses incident to the operation of the company s headquarters and the branch offices and the marketing of its services 
sg a expenses excluding the amortization of intangibles for amounted to  an increase of  or over sg a expenses  expressed as a percentage of revenues  decreased from for to for the increase in total sg a dollars was primarily due to management payroll  advertising expense  rent expense and increased profit sharing and related taxes in connection with the additional branch offices acquired in the tss  tpm and tsu acquisitions 
amortization of intangibles totaled  or of revenues for  which compares to  or of revenues for the increased amortization expense was primarily due to the amortization of intangibles recognized in the acquisitions of tss  tpm and tsu 
the company s effective income tax rate for was  as compared to for the higher effective rate was primarily attributable to the nondeductibility of certain merger expenses 
the company offers various qualified employee benefit plans to its employees  including its worksite employees 
these qualified employee benefit plans include a savings plan the k plan under section k of the internal revenue code the code  a cafeteria plan under code section  a group health plan  a group life insurance plan  a group disability insurance plan and an employee assistance plan 
generally  qualified employee benefit plans are subject to provisions of both the code and the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
in order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the code  qualified plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees 
a definitive judicial interpretation of employer in the context of a peo arrangement has not been established 
the tax exempt status of the company s k plan and cafeteria plan is subject to continuing scrutiny and approval by the internal revenue service the irs and depends upon the company s ability to establish the company s employer employee relationship with peo employees 
the issue of whether the company s tax qualified benefit plans can legally include worksite employees under their coverage has not yet been resolved 
if the worksite employees cannot be covered by the plans  then the exclusive benefit requirement imposed by the code would not be met by the plans as currently administered and the plans could be disqualified 
the irs has established a market segment study group regarding employee leasing for the stated purpose of examining whether peos  such as the company  are the employers of worksite employees under the code provisions applicable to employee benefit plans and are  therefore  able to offer to worksite employees benefit plans that qualify for favorable tax treatment 
the irs study group is reportedly also examining whether the owners of client companies are employees of peo companies under code provisions applicable to employee benefit plans 
to the best of the company s knowledge  the market segment study group has not issued a report 
a peo company headquartered in texas stated publicly over four years ago that the irs national office was being requested by the irs houston district to issue a technical advice memorandum tam on the peo worksite employee issue in connection with an ongoing audit of a plan of the texas peo company 
the stated purpose of tams is to help irs personnel in closing cases and to establish and maintain consistent holdings 
the irs s position is that tams are not precedential  that is  they are limited to the particular taxpayer involved and that taxpayer s set of facts 
the draft request for a tam by the irs houston district reportedly stated its determination that the texas peo company s code section k plan should be disqualified for the reason  among others  that it covers worksite employees who are not employees of the peo company 
the timing and nature of the issuance and contents of any tam regarding the worksite employee issue or any report of the market segment study group regarding employee leasing is unknown at this time 
there has also been public discussion for the past several years of the possibility that the treasury department may propose some form of administrative relief or that congress may provide legislative resolution or clarification regarding this issue 
in the event the tax exempt status of the company s benefit plans were to be discontinued and the benefit plans were to be disqualified  such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is not presently able to predict the likelihood of disqualification nor the resulting range of loss  in light of the lack of public direction from the irs or congress 
years ended december  and net income for amounted to  a decrease of  or from net income of  the small decrease in net income from was primarily due to  of merger expenses in connection with the wimi transaction and a higher income tax rate  offset in part by the effect of a higher gross margin percent and lower sg a expenses

the share of professional employer services revenues had a corresponding increase from of total revenues for to for gross margin for totaled  representing an increase of  or over the gross margin rate of of revenues represents a basis point increase from due primarily to lower payroll taxes and benefits and workers compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues  offset in part by higher direct payroll costs as a percentage of revenues 
the decline in payroll taxes and benefits  in total dollars and as a percent of revenues  for was primarily due to lower state unemployment tax rates 
the increase in direct payroll costs  as a percentage of revenues  was primarily attributable to the increased share of professional employer services business  where payroll costs typically represent a higher percentage of revenues as compared to staffing services

fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company has historically experienced significant fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and expects such fluctuations to continue in the future 
the company s operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors such as seasonality  wage limits on payroll taxes  claims experience for workers compensation  demand and competition for the company s services and the effect of acquisitions 
the company s revenue levels fluctuate from quarter to quarter primarily due to the impact of seasonality on its staffing services business and on certain of its peo clients in the agriculture and forest products related industries 
as a result  the company may have greater revenues and net income in the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year 
payroll taxes and benefits fluctuate with the level of direct payroll costs  but tend to represent a smaller percentage of revenues later in the company s fiscal year as federal and state statutory wage limits for unemployment and social security taxes are exceeded by some employees 
workers compensation expense varies with both the frequency and severity of workplace injury claims reported during a quarter  as well as adverse loss development of prior period claims during a subsequent quarter 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash position at december  decreased by  from december  the decrease in cash at december  was primarily due to cash used in investing activities of  principally in connection with three acquisitions made since january   offset in part by proceeds from operating activities of  and financing activities of  arising from the company s bank term loan and borrowings on its unsecured credit line 
net cash provided by operating activities for amounted to  as compared to  for for  cash flow was primarily generated by net income and depreciation and amortization  coupled with an increase of  in accrued payroll and benefits  offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of  net cash used in investing activities totaled  for  as compared to  for for  cash used in investing activities was primarily for the acquisitions of tss  tpm and tsu totaling  and for capital expenditures of  approximately  of the total capital expenditures was related to new computer hardware and software for the company s new management information system  which was implemented on march  the company presently has no material long term capital commitments 
net cash provided by financing activities for amounted to  which compares to  of net cash used in financing activities in for  the primary source of cash provided by financing activities was an  term loan obtained from the company s principal bank and  of net borrowings on the company s credit line  offset in part by payments on long term debt of  and common stock repurchases of  the term loan was obtained to provide financing for the tsu acquisition and  at december   had an outstanding principal balance of the company renegotiated its loan agreement with its principal bank which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility of million and an million year term loan 
this loan agreement  which expires may   also includes a subfeature for standby letters of credit in connection with certain workers compensation surety arrangements  as to which approximately million was outstanding as of december  the company had an outstanding balance of  on the revolving credit facility at december  see note of the notes to financial statements 
effective december   the company negotiated a minor modification to the quarterly financial covenants of its loan agreement with its principal bank 
the company requested that the minimum working capital requirement be replaced by a minimum current ratio 
in exchange for this accommodation  the company agreed to an increase in the trailing four quarter ebitda requirement 
the company was in compliance with the financial covenants in the loan agreement at december  management expects that the funds anticipated to be generated from operations  together with the bank provided credit facility and other potential sources of financing  will be sufficient in the aggregate to fund the company s working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
on february   the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to  common shares from time to time in open market purchases 
on november   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares  thereby increasing the total number of common shares authorized for repurchase to  during  the company repurchased  shares at an aggregate price of  management anticipates that the capital necessary to execute this program will be provided by existing cash balances and other available resources 
inflation inflation generally has not been a significant factor in the company s operations during the periods discussed above 
the company has taken into account the impact of escalating medical and other costs in establishing reserves for future expenses for self insured workers compensation claims 
year readiness as the company previously reported  its mission critical legacy systems were believed to be year compliant prior to december  such compliance was achieved through minor reprogramming by internal staff at no incremental cost to the company 
the company s non mission critical systems were also brought into compliance in a timely fashion at a very minimal cost 
as discussed above in part i  item  management information systems  the company implemented its new information system on march  the new information system project was initiated in mid to accommodate the anticipated growth of the company and was unrelated to the year compliance issue 
subsequent to december   the company has not experienced any significant problems with any of its internal information systems or any interruption of products or services from any vendors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to the company s short term and long term debt obligations 
as of december   the company had interest bearing debt obligations of approximately million  of which approximately million bears interest at a variable rate and approximately million at a fixed rate of interest 
the variable rate debt is comprised of approximately million outstanding under an unsecured revolving credit facility  which bears interest at the federal funds rate plus 
the company also has an unsecured three year term note with its principal bank  which bears interest at libor plus 
based on the company s overall interest exposure at december   a percent change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s long term debt or its results of operations 
as of december   the company had not entered into any interest rate instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk
