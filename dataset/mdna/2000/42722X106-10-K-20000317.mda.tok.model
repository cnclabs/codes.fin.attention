item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the december  audited consolidated financial statements and notes to those financial statements included in this form k 
statements concerning future performance  developments or events  concerning expectations for growth and market forecasts  and any other guidance on future periods  constitute forward looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which might cause actual results to differ materially from stated expectations 
specific factors include  but are not limited to the effect of interest rate changes  risks associated with acquisition of other banks and opening new branches  the ability to control costs and expenses  and general economic conditions 
additional information on these and other factors which could affect our financial results are included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
general in the fiscal year ended june   we began to implement a growth strategy to broaden our products and services from traditional thrift offerings to those more closely related to commercial banking 
that strategy entails 
geographic and product expansion 
loan portfolio diversification 
development of relationship banking 
maintenance of asset quality we incurred substantial expenses as we have carried out our growth strategy 
those expenses have been concentrated in 
personnel hired in anticipation of growth and expanded market share 
maintaining the mortgage origination capacity during times of fluctuating mortgage origination volumes 
facilities expansion 
upgrading data processing capabilities these expenditures had a negative impact on our earnings in the fiscal year ended june   the fiscal year ended june  and for the six months ended december  positive results from those expenditures emerged in the second half of as the efficiency ratio improved from for to for in the fiscal year ended june   our growth strategy was further bolstered by two significant events 
the january stock offering and conversion 
our acquisition of north pacific bancorporation 
through the january stock offering  we raised million in net new capital which has  and will continue to  enhance our ability to implement our growth strategy 
using million of the net proceeds of the stock offering  we completed out first bank acquisition in june by purchasing all of the outstanding stock of north pacific bancorporation whose wholly owned subsidiary was north pacific bank 
the acquisition of north pacific bank provided further geographical expansion into the pierce county market area and enhanced expertise in commercial banking 
while this acquisition had a significant impact on our growth and financial condition at june   north pacific bank s operations had a minimal impact on our earnings for the year ended june  due to the timing of the closing of the transaction on june  during the six months ended december   we integrated the operations of north pacific bank into heritage bank culminating in the merging of data processing systems effective november  and substantially upgrading north pacific bank s item processing capability to handle existing and projected future volumes 
we invested million in item processing hardware and software and facilities which became operational in december consistent with our strategy  on march  we merged with washington independent bancshares  inc  whose wholly owned subsidiary was central valley bank 
in the merger  we exchanged  shares of our common stock for all of the outstanding shares of washington independent common stock 
this merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and accordingly  our financial information reported herein has been restated to include the accounts and results of operations of washington independent for all periods presented 
net interest income our profitability depends primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between the income we receive on our loan and investment portfolios and our cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected significantly by general economic conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates and by government policies 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated statistics for us related to net interest income 
the average loan balances presented in the table are net of allowances for loan losses 
nonaccrual loans have been included in the tables as loans carrying a zero yield

on april  our board of directors authorized the repurchase in the open market of  of our shares 
this was accomplished in the second quarter for million  or per share 
on october  we announced our intention to repurchase up to of our outstanding common shares  or approximately million shares 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased  shares  representing of the of stock intended to be repurchased for million at an average price of per share 
subsequent to year ending december   on february   we announced the repurchase of an additional  or approximately  shares 
the additional share repurchase will take place over the next months 
results of operations for the years ended december  and net income 
our net income was million or per diluted share for the year ended december  as compared to million or per diluted share for the same period last year 
the amounts include merger related charges of  on a pre tax basis 
excluding these charges  net income for the twelve months ended december  was million or per diluted share 
these nonrecurring charges were related to severance and other costs associated with the merger and integration of north pacific bank into heritage bank in november  costs associated with the formerly proposed acquisition of harbor bancorp which was terminated by mutual agreement in december  and costs associated with the then pending acquisition of washington independent  which was completed march  and accounted for as a pooling of interests 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared with the same period last year  primarily as a result of the million increase in the average balance of loans which was heavily concentrated in commercial loans 
average interest earning assets grew million as average interest earning short term investments primarily deposits decreased by million to fund loan growth 
net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets net interest margin for the year ended december  increased to from for the same period last year 
the increase was the result of strong growth in commercial loans which have higher yields and a shift away from overnight funds repossessed from the million in net proceeds from the january stock offering 
our net interest spread for the year ended december  has increased to from for the prior year as a result of the decrease in the average cost of funds to for the year ended december  from for the same period last year 
this resulted from our efforts  particularly during at lowering the cost of deposits 
although retail deposit balances declined  it had its desired effect on our cost of funds 
provision for loan losses 
during the year ended december   we provided  through operations to maintain our allowance for loan losses at an adequate level during a time of change in loan portfolio composition and loan growth 
in the year ended december   we experienced net charge offs of  while our loan portfolio  and in particular commercial loans  have grown substantially over the past three years  our asset quality has remained very solid as demonstrated by the nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of at december  because commercial business lending generally involves greater risk than those associated with residential and commercial real estate lending  we have increased the portion of our general allowance for loan losses allocated to our commercial loans over the past three years 
we consider the allowance for loan losses at december  to be adequate to cover reasonably foreseeable loan losses based on our assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including the level of problem loans  business conditions  estimated collateral values  loss experience and credit concentrations 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income decreased million for the year ended december  compared with the prior year 
the decline is attributable to the region wide reduction in the level of mortgage banking activity particularly for refinanced mortgages 
loan sale gains fell million to million for from million in  a decline of 
total mortgage production of million during the year ended december  was down from the prior year production of million by million 
noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased million for the year ended compared to the period 
included  in charges related to severance and other costs associated with the merger and integration of north pacific bank into heritage bank in november  costs associated with the formerly proposed acquisition of harbor bancorp terminated by mutual agreement in december and costs associated with the then pending acquisition of washington independent 
excluding these non recurring charges from  noninterest expense increased million primarily in the areas of salaries and benefits  occupancy  amortization of goodwill and other expenses related to the strengthening of our capabilities in commercial lending  plus a full year s impact of north pacific bank s operations which had impacted only the second half of our efficiency ratio for was  compared with for the same twelve month period in results of operations for the six month periods ended december  and net income 
our net income before merger related charges was million or per diluted share for the six months ended december  as compared to million or per diluted share for the same period in including merger related charges of  on a pre tax basis  net income for the six months ended december  was million or per diluted share 
these nonrecurring charges were related to severance and other costs associated with the merger and integration of north pacific bank into heritage bank in november  costs associated with the formerly proposed acquisition of harbor bancorp which was terminated by mutual agreement in december  and costs associated with the pending acquisition of washington independent  which was completed on march  and accounted for as a pooling of interests 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  for the six months ended december  compared with the same period in  primarily as a result of a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets 
this growth in interest earning assets was attributable to million in interest earning assets acquired through north pacific bank in june and the interest earning assets funded by the million in net proceeds raised in our january stock offering 
average loan balances increased million  or  which was concentrated in commercial loans 
net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets net interest margin annualized for the six months ended december  increased to from for the same period in the increase was the result of strong growth in commercial loans which have higher yields and a lower cost funding mix attributable to the million in net proceeds from our january stock offering and the addition of lower cost deposits acquired with north pacific bank 
the significant shift in our funding mix is demonstrated in our ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities which increased to for the six months ended december  from for the same period in this ratio indicates that we are funding more of our earning asset growth with noninterest bearing funds capital and noninterest bearing deposits 
our net interest spread annualized for the six months ended december  declined to from for the same period in as a result of the decrease in the average yield on earning assets to for the six months ended december  from for the same period last year 
the increase in the average balances of investment securities and interest earning deposits at yields significantly below the average earning asset yield  as well as the decline in market interest rates  had the effect of decreasing the overall earning asset yield for the six months ended december  provision for loan losses 
during the six months ended december   we provided  through operations to maintain our allowance for loan losses at an adequate level during a time of change in loan portfolio composition and loan growth 
in the six months ended december   we experienced net charge offs of  most of which were related to loans originated and classified by north pacific bank prior to our acquisition of north pacific bank in june while our loan portfolio  and in particular commercial loans  have grown substantially from to  our asset quality remained very solid as demonstrated by the nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of at december  because commercial business lending generally involves greater risk than those associated with residential and commercial real estate lending  we increased the portion of our general allowance for loan losses allocated to our commercial loans during those years 
we considered the allowance for loan losses at december  to be adequate to cover reasonably foreseeable loan losses based on our assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including the level of problem loans  business conditions  estimated collateral values  loss experience and credit concentrations 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased  or  for the six months ended december  compared with the same period in this increase was primarily due to increases in gains on sales of loans  service charges on deposits and other income 
gains on sales of loans increased  or for the period compared to the same period in due to the increase in the volume of mortgage loans sold in the period 
service charges on deposits increased  or  as a result of growth in business and personal checking accounts 
other income increased  or  for the period due to  in fees from vehicle licensing activities performed by a former subsidiary of north pacific bank as well as increases in the volume of loan servicing fees and merchant card processing fees 
noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased million  or  for the period compared to the period 
this million increase included  in merger related charges related to severance and other costs associated with the merger and integration of north pacific bank into heritage bank in november  costs associated with the formerly proposed acquisition of harbor bancorp which was terminated by mutual agreement in december and costs associated with the then pending acquisition of washington independent 
excluding merger related charges  noninterest expense increased million  or  primarily in the areas of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  amortization of goodwill and other noninterest expenses due to the impact of the acquisition and integration of the operations of north pacific bank 
total noninterest expense adjusted for the nonrecurring merger related charges was of total revenue the sum of net interest income and noninterest income for the six months ended december  as compared to for the six months ended december  results of operations for the years ended june  and net income 
our earnings increased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended june   compared with million  or per diluted share  for the same period in  an increase of 
the increase in net income was primarily attributable to a million increase in the average balance of earning assets and a widening of the net interest margin 
the majority of the increase in earning assets and the widening of the net interest margin was the result of the large influx of equity capital million from our january stock offering 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or in compared to  primarily as a result of a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets 
this growth in interest earning assets was funded by the million in net proceeds raised in our january stock offering 
average loan balances increased million  or  which was concentrated in commercial loans with higher yields 
net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets net interest margin for increased to from in the increase was primarily attributable to growth in earning assets combined with a significant shift in our funding mix due to the funds raised in our stock offering 
this is demonstrated by the increase in our ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities to for from for which indicates that we are funding more of our earning asset growth with non interest bearing funds capital and noninterest bearing deposits 
our net interest spread for declined to from for as a result of the decrease in the average yield on earning assets to for from for although the average yield on loans increased to for from for due primarily to the growth in commercial loans with higher yields  the increase in the average balances of investment securities and interest earning deposits at yields significantly below the average earning asset yield had the effect of decreasing the overall earning asset yield for provision for loan losses 
during  we provided  through operations to maintain our allowance for loan losses at an adequate level during a time of change in loan portfolio composition and loan growth 
in  we recorded a million recovery on a multifamily mortgage loan which had been partially charged off in a prior year 
in reviewing the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses as of june   we determined that the allowance balance was more than adequate to cover any potential losses in our loan portfolio and therefore reduced the allowance balance through a  negative provision for loan losses 
we considered the allowance for loan losses at june  to be adequate to cover reasonably foreseeable loan losses based on our assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including the level of problem loans  business conditions  estimated collateral values  loss experience and credit concentrations 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased  or  for compared with primarily due to the  or  increase in gains on sales of loans for the increase in gains on sales of loans was attributable to the increase in the volume of mortgages sold million for compared to million for and the increase in residential mortgage loan originations for compared to commissions on sales of annuities and securities decreased  or  as a result of lower sales volume due to staff turnover 
service charges on deposits increased  or  due to growth in personal and business checking accounts 
other income increased  or  for due to increases in the volume of fees related to merchant credit card processing and customer check ordering activity 
noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense decreased  or  in compared with excluding the million special saif assessment in  noninterest expense in increased million  or  compared with adjusted expense levels 
the increase in noninterest expenses during were concentrated in data processing and marketing expenses and represent a continuation of our implementation of our growth strategy  specifically  geographical and product expansion  development of relationship banking and loan portfolio diversification 
we have developed business checking accounts and commercial lending products and services for businesses and their owners  introduced credit and debit cards  installed an automated response system for customer account inquiries and developed products to assist realtors and potential borrowers to obtain information about loan programs 
total noninterest expense was of total revenue the sum of net interest income and noninterest income for the year ended june  as compared to adjusted for the nonrecurring saif assessment for salaries and employee benefits increased  or  for as a result of increases in mortgage commissions  salaries and benefits related to north pacific bank employees for june and increases in payroll taxes  health insurance and other employee benefits 
mortgage commissions increased  or  due to the increased volume of residential mortgage loans originated and the increased proportion of that volume produced by commissioned loan officers 
the increases in data processing  marketing and other expenses were due to our implementation of our growth strategy as described in the paragraph above 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are deposits  loan repayments  loan sales  maturing investment securities and advances from the fhlb of seattle 
these funds  together with retained earnings  equity and other borrowed funds  are used to make loans  acquire investment securities and other assets and to fund continuing operations 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals  to satisfy other financial commitments and to fund operations 
we generally maintain sufficient cash and short term investments to meet short term liquidity needs 
at december  cash and cash equivalents totaled million  or of total assets 
at december   heritage bank maintained a credit facility with the fhlb of seattle for million of which only million was outstanding at that date 
to fund growth in  our strategy has been to acquire core deposits which we define to include all deposits except public funds from our retail accounts  non interest bearing demand deposits from our commercial customers and public funds from the state of washington 
total deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the largest increase in deposits occurred in public funds which grew million 
in the month of december we increased our public deposit totals to give us additional short term funds to provide for exigencies over the yk year end 
year to year non interest bearing demand deposits grew by million while all other deposits declined by million 
the decline in all other deposits occurred primarily in retail time certificates of deposit which management made a conscious decision in the first half of year to price less aggressively expecting to incur runoff 
we anticipate that we will continue to rely on the same sources of funds in the future and will use those funds primarily to make loans and purchase investment securities 
loan growth was also funded in through a reduction in cash cash on hand and in banks  interest earning overnight deposits  and federal funds sold of million or to million at december  from million at december  we and our banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements 
as of december   we and our banks were classified as well capitalized institutions under the criteria established by the fdic act 
as of june    and december  heritage bank was also classified as a well capitalized institution 
asset liability management our primary financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while controlling our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates 
to accomplish this objective  we have formulated an interest rate risk management policy that attempts to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities while maintaining an acceptable interest rate sensitivity position 
the principal strategies which we employ to control our interest rate sensitivity are the sale of most long term  fixed rate  one to four family residential mortgage loan originations  the origination of commercial loans and residential construction loans at variable interest rates for terms generally one year or less  and offering noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts to businesses and individuals 
the longer term objective is to increase the proportion of noninterest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing demand deposits and money market accounts and savings deposits relative to certificates of deposit thereby reducing interest sensitivity and risk our asset and liability management strategies have resulted in a modest positive gap of for the month period and an equally modest negative one year gap of as of december  these gaps measure the difference between the dollar amount of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within the designated period months and one year as a percentage of total interest earning assets  based on certain estimates and assumptions as discussed below 
the acquisition of north pacific bank accelerated our progress toward our objective of achieving balance by adding more variable rate commercial loans to our loan portfolio and reducing the percentage of certificates of deposit to total deposits from as of june  to as of december  with a small increase to as of december  we believe that the implementation of our operating strategies has reduced the potential effects of changes in market interest rates on our results of operations 
the continuing positive gap for the month period indicates that decreases in market interest rates may adversely affect our results in the near term 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing and the resulting interest rate sensitivity gap of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  based upon estimates of expected mortgage prepayment rates and deposit decay rates consistent with national trends 
we have adjusted mortgage loan maturities for loans held for sale by reflecting these loans in the zero to three month category which is consistent with their sale in the secondary mortgage market 
the amounts in the table are derived from our internal data  and because certain assumptions have been utilized in presenting this data  the amounts may not be consistent with financial information appearing elsewhere in this document that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the amounts in the tables also could be significantly affected by external factors  such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawal of deposits and competition 
estimated maturity or repricing within more than months months years years years total dollars in thousands interest earnings assets loans       investment securities      fhlb stock   fed funds sold   interest earning deposits total interest earning assets       noninterest earning assets  total assets  interest bearing liabilities total interest bearing deposits     fhlb advances and other borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities     noninterest bearing liabilities and equity  total liabilities and equity  rate sensitivity gap       cumulative rate sensitivity gap amount      as a percentage of interest earning assets certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  some assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in the interest rates of those assets both on a short term basis and over the lives of such assets 
further  in the event of a change in market interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of a substantial increase in market interest rates 
year issues we utilize various computer software programs to provide banking products and services to our customers 
many existing computer programs used only two digits to identify a year in the date field and were not designed to consider the impact of the change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could have failed or created erroneous results on or at the year the year issue affected virtually all companies and organizations 
we spent approximately  analyzing  testing  upgrading systems  and planning for possible contingencies to assure our customers  stockholders  and the general public that we would be able to facilitate the delivery of our financial services 
as a result of these efforts  we experienced no events  major or otherwise  related to the programming problem 
impact of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
recent financial accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no
