item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion contains forward looking statements and such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below and in business and additional business risks  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of innovative therapeutics for treatment of cancer based on our proprietary virus technology platform 
we believe our technology platform represents a novel approach in developing therapeutics that selectively kill cancer cells in the body  leaving healthy  non cancerous tissues unharmed 
our lead product candidate  onyx  is genetically engineered to selectively replicate in and destroy human tumors based on the loss of p tumor suppressor gene function in cancer cells 
we have now completed phase ii clinical trials using onyx for the treatment of head and neck cancer 
based on these results  and in collaboration with warner lambert  we expect to begin a pivotal phase iii clinical trial of onyx by the middle of we are also evaluating onyx in clinical trials for a number of other cancer indications 
other potential products from our technology platform include viruses that replicate in and destroy human tumors based on defects in the rb tumor suppressor gene function in cancer cells 
additionally  we are developing armed viruses that increase the cancer killing power of the virus and expand the range of human cancers sensitive to the therapy 
further  we are working with bayer and warner lambert to identify and develop small molecule therapeutic compounds for a number of cancers 
together with bayer  we have selected an anticancer compound for clinical development 
depending upon final results of preclinical testing of this compound  we expect bayer to file an ind with the fda by the middle of we have not been profitable since inception and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to expenses associated with the expansion of our self funded virus research and development programs 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
in january  we sold and issued  shares of common stock to four institutional investors in a private placement  at a price of per share  for aggregate proceeds of  in february  we sold and issued  shares of common stock to warner lambert in a private placement  at a price of per share  for aggregate proceeds of  our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our research and development efforts  the results of the onyx clinical trials  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the sale of proposed products in the foreseeable future 
we expect that all of our revenues in the foreseeable future will be generated from collaboration agreements 
results of operations years ended december   and total revenues 
our total revenues in each of the last three years was derived almost exclusively from collaborative research and development programs with warner lambert  bayer and eli lilly company 
the approximate revenue from each of our programs  and other sources for each of the past three years was as follows year ended december  in millions warner lambert onyx and armed viruses cell cycle inflammation bayer eli lilly company total contract revenues all other sources total revenues total revenues increased by from to and from to  in each case primarily as a result of increased contract revenues 
total contract revenues are expected to increase in from total contract revenues realized in because we anticipate a full year of revenues under the warner lambert onyx collaborative agreement  which was in effect for only four months of in january  our collaboration with bayer transitioned from a research program to the co development of a product candidate and as a result  we will not recognize any revenue in from this program 
in june  the collaboration program with eli lilly company expired pursuant to the terms of the agreement and as a result  we will not recognize any future revenues under this program 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the expense decrease of was primarily due to a reduced level of research activities associated with the transition of the ras program 
the expense increase of was primarily due to additional costs associated with phase i and phase ii clinical trials of onyx and  additionally  due to higher research expenses in our self funded virus program 
research under our collaboration agreements with warner lambert is fully funded by them up to specified levels 
we expect to continue to expand the scope of our self funded virus research and development programs in future periods  which may result in substantial increases in research and development expenses 
these research and development expenses may not be funded by collaborative parties 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses for all three years remained at essentially the same level 
it is anticipated that general and administrative expenses may increase modestly in future periods in order to support increases in research and development activities 
net interest income 
we had net interest income of million in  million in and million in net interest income decreased by in primarily due to a lower average balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
net interest income decreased by in primarily due to higher interest expense on a line of credit arrangement entered into in december liquidity and capital resources since our inception  our cash expenditures have substantially exceeded our revenues  and we have relied primarily on the proceeds from the sale of equity securities and revenues from collaborative research and development agreements to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash and investments of million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the decrease of million in was primarily due to cash used in operations of million  repayment of debt of million and capital expenditures of million 
the decrease of million in was primarily due to cash used in operations of million  repayment of debt of million and capital expenditures of million primarily offset by the issuance of  shares of common stock to two institutional investors  raising million in aggregate proceeds 
our cash used in operations was million in  million in and million in the cash was used primarily to fund increasing levels of research and development and the general and administrative expenses necessary to support increased operations 
expenditures for capital equipment amounted to million in  as compared to million in and million in we currently expect to make expenditures for capital equipment of approximately million in we recorded and amortized over the related vesting periods deferred compensation representing the difference between the exercise price of options granted and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of grant 
options generally vest over four years 
the amortization of deferred compensation was  in and  in both and during  deferred compensation was fully amortized 
we believe that our existing capital resources and interest thereon including equity placements of million in early and anticipated revenues from existing collaborations will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations through at least march there can be no assurance  however  that changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses will not result in the expenditure of such resources before such time  and in any event  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in future periods 
we intend to seek such additional funding through collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other financing sources that may be available 
however  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement of financial reporting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
change in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designed as part of a hedge transaction  and  if so  the type of hedge transaction 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial reporting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 or sfas  which amends sfas to be effective for all fiscal quarters or all fiscal years beginning after june  management does not currently expect that adoption of sfas will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
impact of the year in our public disclosures in  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to be year compliant 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of computer systems and research and development software and instrumentation 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in those systems applications or our financial and information technology systems 
we believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we expensed approximately  during in connection with remediating our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our research and development systems  other internal systems or the products and services of our significant suppliers and other third parties 
we will continue to monitor our computer applications and those of our suppliers throughout the year to ensure that any year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer  limit duration by restricting the term  and hold investments to maturity except under rare circumstances 
we classify our cash equivalents or short term investments as fixed rate if the rate of return on an instrument remains fixed over its term 
as of december   all of our cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as fixed rate 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of our cash equivalents and short term investments at december  fair value average maturity in millions interest rate cash equivalents  fixed rate daily short term investments  fixed rate year
