interest rate risk measurement and management the net interest income of the corporation is subject to interest rate risk to the extent the corporation s interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits and borrowings mature or reprice on a different basis than its interest earning assets primarily loans and investment securities 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets during a given period  an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  a decrease in interest rates could have a negative impact on net interest income 
in addition  the impact of interest rate swings may be exacerbated by factors such as our customers propensity to manage their demand deposit balances more or less aggressively or to refinance mortgage and other consumer loans depending on the interest rate environment 
the asset liability committees of each of the corporation s subsidiary companies are responsible for managing interest rate risk 
the asset liability committees generally meet monthly 
recommendations for changes to a particular subsidiary s interest rate profile  should they be deemed necessary and exceed established policies  are made to its board of directors 
other than loans that are originated and held for sale and commitments to purchase and sell foreign currencies and mortgage backed securities  the corporation s interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
the corporation s exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily by taking actions that impact certain balance sheet accounts eg  lengthening or shortening maturities in the investment portfolio  changing asset and or liability mix including increasing or decreasing the amounts of fixed and or variable instruments held by the corporation to adjust sensitivity to interest rate changes and or utilizing off balance sheet instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors  options  or forwards 
the corporation models its net interest income in order to quantify its exposure to changes in interest rates 
generally  the size of the balance sheet is held constant and then subjected to interest rate shocks up and down of and basis points equals basis points each 
each account level item is repriced according to its respective contractual characteristics  including any imbedded options which might exist eg  periodic interest rate caps or floors or loans which permit the borrower to prepay the principal balance of the loan prior to maturity without penalty 
off balance sheet instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps or floors are included as part of the modeling process 
for each interest rate shock scenario  net interest income over a month horizon is compared against the results of a scenario in which no interest rate change occurs a flat rate scenario to determine the level of interest rate risk at that time 
the projected impact of and basis point increases and decreases in interest rates on the corporation s consolidated net interest income over the next months beginning january  and is shown below

the changes in the models are due to differences in interest rate environments which include the absolute level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between various benchmark rates 
significant assumptions utilized and inherent limitations the significant net interest income changes for each interest rate scenario presented above include assumptions based on accelerating or decelerating mortgage prepayments in declining or rising scenarios  respectively  and adjusting deposit levels and mix in the different interest rate scenarios 
the magnitude of changes to both areas in turn are based upon analyses of customers behavior in differing rate environments 
however  these analyses may differ from actual future customer behavior 
for example  actual prepayments may differ from current assumptions as prepayments are affected by many variables which cannot be predicted with certainty eg  prepayments of mortgages may differ on fixed and adjustable loans depending upon current interest rates  expectations of future interest rates  availability of refinancing  economic benefit to borrower  financial viability of borrower  etc as with any model for analyzing interest rate risk  certain limitations are inherent in the method of analysis presented above 
for example  the actual impact on net interest income due to certain interest rate shocks may differ from those projections presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the analysis 
furthermore  the analysis does not consider the effects of a changed level of overall economic activity that could exist in certain interest rate environments 
moreover  the method of analysis used does not take into account the actions that management might take to respond to changes in interest rates because of inherent difficulties in determining the likelihood or impact of any such response 
forward looking statements certain matters contained in this item a 
are forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the corporation s actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
a discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations page in the financial review section of the corporation s annual report and is incorporated herein by reference thereto
