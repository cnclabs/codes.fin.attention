certain of these acquisitions provide for contingent payments by the company as a part of the purchase consideration based upon the operating results of the acquired businesses for specified future periods 
the acquisitions were financed by the company principally through its issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowings under credit facilities 
as a result  the company s historical results of operations include bridge financing costs  which are not expected to be incurred in future periods  and preferred stock dividends 
all previously issued preferred stock has been repurchased or redeemed by the company

the company offers health  dental  disability and life insurance to its billable employees 
staffing and consulting companies  including the company  typically pay their billable employees for their services before receiving payment from their customers  often resulting in significant outstanding receivables 
to the extent the company increases revenues through acquisitions and or internal growth  these receivables will grow and there will be greater requirements for borrowing availability under its credit facilities to fund current operations

selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales of services was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this percentage increase was principally attributable to the decline of net sales of services discussed above 
operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  this decrease was principally attributable to the reduced net sales of services discussed above  partially offset by increased margins 
the company s interest expense for and is attributable to the interest on the company s credit facility with heller financial  inc the credit facility  coi s senior notes due the coi notes and the company s senior secured pik debentures due the pik debentures  which obligations were incurred in  principally in connection with the funding of business acquisitions

the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate and the company s effective tax rate relates primarily to the nondeductibility of amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets  the nondeductibility of a portion of the interest expense associated with the pik debentures and adjustments to prior period tax estimates 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales of services of million for the year ended december  were million  or nearly higher than net sales of services for the year ended december  the increase in net sales of services is attributable principally to the company s acquisition of uniforce on november cost of services for the year ended december  was of net sales of services compared to cost of services of for the year ended december  the cost of services decrease of for is a result of the company s business mix in that year  which reflected the full period impact of acquisitions completed during as well as growth in sales to the company s it  telecom and financial services customers 
sales in these fields have historically generated higher gross margins than those in the more mature technical staffing field 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this percentage increase was principally attributable to the operations of the company s uniforce subsidiary  which was acquired in uniforce s selling  general and administrative fees  which include significant licensee costs related to its franchise operations  are substantially higher on a percentage basis than those historically recorded by the company

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company pays its billable employees weekly for their services  and remits certain statutory payroll and related taxes as well as other fringe benefits 
invoices are generated to reflect these costs plus the company s markup 
these bills are typically paid in approximately days 
increases in the company s net sales of services  resulting from expansion of existing offices or establishment of new offices  will require additional cash resources 
management of the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds anticipated to be available under the credit facility will be sufficient to service the company s indebtedness and to meet anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
as of december   the company had outstanding million in principal amount of pik debentures bearing interest at a rate of  million in principal amount of coi notes bearing interest at a rate of and million outstanding under the credit facility bearing interest at an average rate of per annum 
the debt service costs associated with the borrowings under the coi notes and the credit facility have significantly reduced the company s liquidity 
the debt service costs associated with the pik debentures may be satisfied through the issuance of new notes 
to date  the company has chosen to issue new notes to pay these costs 
as of december   approximately million  or  of the company s total assets were intangible assets 
these intangible assets substantially represent amounts attributable to goodwill recorded in connection with the company s acquisitions and will be amortized over a five to year period  resulting in an annual charge of approximately million 
the company is obligated under various acquisition agreements to make earn out payments to the sellers of acquired companies  subject to the acquired companies having met certain contractual requirements 
the maximum amount of the remaining potential earn out payments is million in cash payable in the two year period beginning january  the company cannot currently estimate whether it will be obligated to pay the maximum amount  however  the company anticipates that the cash generated by the operations of the acquired companies will provide all or a substantial part of the capital required to fund the cash portion of the earn out payments 
during the year ended december   the company s primary sources of funds to meet working capital needs were from operating activities and borrowings under the credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents increased million during the year ended december  cash flows provided by operating activities of million exceeded cash flows used in financing activities of  and million of cash flows used in investing activities 
year as described in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  and its quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended march   june  and september   the company has examined its critical it and non it operating systems for year compliance 
since entering the year  the company has not experienced any significant disruptions to its business either directly or by reason of any year problems affecting the company s customers or suppliers 
the company will continue to monitor its critical systems over the next several months  but does not anticipate any significant year impact on its business 
as previously disclosed  the company significantly upgraded its computing systems over the last several years  principally for reasons unrelated to year issues 
consequently  the company did not incur significant incremental costs in seeking to become year compliant 
seasonality the company s quarterly operating results are affected primarily by the number of billing days in the quarter and the seasonality of its customers businesses 
demand for technical staffing services has historically been lower during the year end holidays through january of the following year  showing gradual improvement over the remainder of the year 
although less pronounced than in technical services  the demand for telecom and it services is typically lower during the first quarter until customers operating budgets are finalized 
the company believes that the effects of seasonality will be less severe in the future if sales to it  telecom and financial services customers continue to increase as a percentage of the company s consolidated net sales of services 
other matters in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
the fasb issued sfas no 
in june to delay the effective date of sfas to the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after june  january  for the company 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas  as amended by sfas  to have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
forward looking statements various statements made in this item and elsewhere in this report concerning the manner in which the company intends to conduct its future operations  and potential trends that may impact future results of operations  are forward looking statements 
the company may be unable to realize its plans and objectives due to various important factors  including  but not limited to  heightened competition for customers as well as for contingent personnel which could potentially require the company s to reduce its current fee scales without being able to reduce the personnel costs of its billable employees  due to the company s significant leverage  its greater vulnerability to economic downturns and its diminished ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or for other purposes  and if the company is unable to sustain the cash flow necessary to support the significant amortization charges related to goodwill for its acquired businesses  it could be required to write off the impaired assets  which could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations 
additional important factors that could cause the company to be unable to realize its plans and objectives are described under risk factors in the registration statement on form s of the company filed with the securities and exchange commission on july  registration no 

the disclosure under risk factors in the registration statement may be accessed through the web site maintained by the securities and exchange commission at http www

in addition  the company will provide  without charge  a copy of such risk factors disclosure to each stockholder of the company who requests such information 
requests for copies should be directed to the attention of linda annicelli  vice president of administration at comforce corporation  crossways park drive  po box  woodbury  new york  telephone item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the preponderance of the company s borrowings are fixed rate obligations 
during  only approximately of the company s interest expense was attributable to variable rate loans  all of which were under the credit facility 
consequently  management does not believe that any adjustments to the rate under the credit facility are likely to have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the immediate future 
assuming an immediate increase in the interest rate under the credit facility  the impact to the company in annualized interest payable would be approximately  since management does not believe that any adjustments to the rate under the credit facility are likely to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  the company has not entered into any swap agreements or other hedging transactions as a means of limiting exposure to interest rate fluctuations
