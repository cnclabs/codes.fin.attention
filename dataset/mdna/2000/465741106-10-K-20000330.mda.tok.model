item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial information and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview itron is a leading provider to the energy and water industry of integrated systems solutions for collecting  communicating  analyzing and managing information about energy and water usage 
we design  develop  manufacture  market  install and service hardware  software and integrated systems that enable customers to obtain  analyze and use meter data 
our major product lines include automatic meter reading amr systems and electronic meter reading or handheld systems 
we both sell our products and provide outsourcing services 
effective january  we reorganized internally around strategic business units sbus focused on the customer segments that we serve 
these include natural gas systems  water and public power systems  electric systems  international systems and energy information systems 
we have also created an sbu focused on potential new business 
future reporting of financial and operating results will include information about sbu results 
our amr solutions primarily utilize radio and telephone technology to collect meter data and include off site amr  mobile amr and network amr technology reading options 
off site amr utilizes a radio device attached to an itron handheld computer that collects data from meters equipped with our radio meter modules 
mobile amr uses a transceiver in a vehicle to collect data from meters equipped with our radio meter modules as the vehicle passes by 
we offer a number of network amr solutions that utilize radio  telephone  cellular  or a combination of these technologies  to collect and transmit meter information from a variety of fixed locations 
our handheld systems product line includes the sale and service of ruggedized handheld computers and supporting products that record visually obtained meter data 
outsourcing services typically involve the installation  operation and or maintenance of systems that provide meter information for billing and management purposes 
outsourcing contracts usually cover long timeframes and typically involve contracts in which we own  operate and maintain the system for a periodic fee 
we currently derive substantially all of our revenue from product sales and services to utilities 
however  we have done business with other utility industry participants such as energy service providers and end user customers  and we may see an increasing percentage of sales to these customers 
we have experienced variability of operating results on both an annual and a quarterly basis due primarily to utility purchasing patterns and delays of purchasing decisions 
in recent years these delays have generally resulted from changes or potential changes to the federal and state regulatory frameworks in the electric utility industry  and mergers and acquisitions in the utility industry 
prior to  our growth was driven primarily by new product introductions and by acquisitions of businesses or technologies for the amr market 
we expected the amr market prior to to grow much faster than it did and invested in manufacturing capacity and product development to support that growth 
partly as a result of slower overall market growth than expected  we incurred losses for five of the last eight quarters 
with minimal overall amr market penetration  we believe that there are still tremendous growth opportunities in that market 
in we initiated some limited restructuring measures to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
in  we aggressively extended our restructuring activities to further reduce spending and to provide greater focus 
these restructuring activities are described in more detail below and have resulted in significant changes  which will enable us to be profitable in results of operations revenues the following table shows our revenue and percent change from the prior year by type of system or service 
year ended december  in millions change change amr systems handheld systems outsourcing total revenues compared to marked the first year in our history in which amr systems revenues declined from the previous year 
the largest decrease in amr revenues was in the electric segment of the market  which is our market segment most impacted by deregulation and industry consolidation 
also affecting amr revenues for was an order issued by the fcc mid year  which temporarily restricted our customers abilities to get access to radio licenses required to use certain of our amr products and therefore resulted in lower amr revenues in the last half of the order was lifted shortly before the end of we shipped  electric meter modules in  down from the  units shipped in the largest factor impacting this was that in  we had a very large order with one electric utility customer for a network amr system covering over  meters that we did not replace with a similar sized order in additionally  revenues from that same customer were reduced by a million price concession related to a number of changes in the customer s requirements for the system  including the elimination of their need for meter level outage information 
both gas and water meter module shipment volume increased in and was million units total on a combined basis  representing an increase over we believe revenues in our gas business will be somewhat flat or slightly lower in compared to as we complete shipments on a contract to a single large gas utility in the first half of we expect to continue to see good growth in our water market as only of meters in this market are currently automated 
amr revenues from the sale of products in our energy information systems eis market increased to million in eis systems include products for large commercial and industrial c i customers of utilities  such as power billing systems  as well as products and systems for deregulated environments to manage wholesale market settlement transactions 
we believe that we will continue to experience good growth in the eis market as products and systems aimed at c i customers the largest users of energy and water and wholesale markets will be of increasing importance as deregulation of the energy marketplace continues 
handheld systems revenues increased over from increased volume to both north american and international markets 
customer upgrades to handheld systems that were yk compliant and sales of our portable network pn radio card  a new product introduced in late  drove the increase 
we expect to have future handheld systems revenues from upgrades and replacements of systems in north america and from further penetration into international markets 
we expect revenues from these systems to be somewhat flat over the long term 
outsourcing revenues  which are included in our finance segment  declined  or million  in we use the cost to cost percentage of completion method of accounting for outsourcing contracts and about million of the decrease resulted from an adjustment to our estimates of revenues to be received in providing meter reads under our contract with duquesne light company duquesne 
this contract is a year outsourcing agreement  in which we own and operate a network amr system  and provide information from that system to duquesne 
we update our estimates every quarter for our outsourcing contracts and as required by the percentage of completion accounting method  record any material changes in estimates in the quarter they are determined 
we recorded the million reduction in outsourcing revenues in the fourth quarter for changed estimates on the duquesne contract 
subsequent to december   we entered into a non binding mou with duquesne to sell the system to them 
see additional comments below under gross margin and note to our accompanying financial statements 
assuming the sale to duquesne is completed and no other large outsourcing agreements are signed  we expect our outsourcing revenues to decrease significantly in additional information about revenues is provided in note of our accompanying financial statements 
compared to in  amr systems revenues increased  or million  over the increased revenues were primarily the result of shipments to  and installation of  a large network system for one electric utility 
substantially all shipments and installations under this contract were completed by the end of sales of new amr hardware  primarily for water meters  and software products introduced in also contributed to the increase 
handheld systems revenues increased million  or  in over the increased revenues came from sales of the new pn cards for handheld computers 
pn cards are credit card sized radio devices  that provide remote reads of meters equipped with itron radio meter modules 
also had a higher proportion of software and service revenue than outsourcing revenues in remained fairly level with the majority of outsourcing revenues for were related to the company s contract with duquesne 
gross margin our gross margin was in compared to in and in the table below reflects gross margin as a percentage of corresponding revenue and the percentage change from the prior year 
year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease amr systems handheld systems outsourcing operations cost outsourcing loss on project sale total gross margin compared to there were a number of significant charges affecting gross margins in these included a million charge for the write down of outsourcing assets related to the proposed sale of those assets to duquesne see additional discussion under outsourcing gross margins below  a million reduction in revenue and a million increase to cost of sales for the impact of changes in estimates to complete the duquesne contract see additional discussion under the revenues caption above and outsourcing gross margins below  the million sales concession mentioned under the revenues caption above  and million of forward losses on amr development contracts in europe in which we now expect costs to exceed the committed funding 
the international forward losses were discovered in our analysis of european operations during the fourth quarter of  at which time it was determined that we had significantly underestimated the development efforts needed to complete our commitments under four development contracts 
the total of the above items is approximately million  and without them  gross margin for the year would have been closer to the level reported for overall amr systems gross margin in improved as a percentage of revenue  but declined in total dollars  due to lower sales volumes 
amr margins would have been even higher as a percentage of revenues without the sales concession and international forward losses discussed above 
margins on the large network system in for the electric utility mentioned in the revenues discussion above were significantly lower than normal  and the margin improvement reflects the absence of that lower margin business 
we shipped approximately million meter modules in  down approximately from reduced capacity utilization has burdened overall gross margins in recent years 
our restructuring actions included the consolidation of high volume manufacturing operations from spokane  washington and boise  idaho into our waseca  minnesota plant see discussion below under restructuring 
the consolidation was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of and we expect to reduce annual manufacturing costs by to million as a result of these actions 
handheld gross margins decreased to of revenues in from in in  handheld systems revenues were mostly from upgrade and replacement sales  which typically have lower net selling prices 
in addition  each sale of upgrade replacement systems initiates a new warranty period for the customer where we do not receive post sale service revenue for a period of time  typically one year 
the mix of sales between north american and international customers  and the size of the systems sold  can also significantly affect handheld systems gross margins 
outsourcing gross margins were negative in because of an expected loss on the sale of our outsourced network amr system at duquesne to an affiliate of duquesne  and because of additional accruals in for estimated costs to complete our remaining obligations for this customer 
these two items had the impact of reducing outsourcing gross profits by approximately million 
on february   we entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with dqe  the parent of duquesne light company  to sell them or an affiliate of theirs our network amr system that provides duquesne with meter information for billing and other purposes for their customers in the pittsburgh area 
the sale  which is dependent upon satisfactory completion of due diligence and is scheduled to close in late march or early april  provides for a cash payment of million for the purchase of the system 
the expected million loss resulting from this sale has been recognized in in outsourcing cost of sales  consisting primarily of a write off of all of the duquesne contract receivables current and non current  net of certain liabilities  which was approximately million  and an million impairment charge for the assets being sold 
in connection with the sale  we will enter into a warranty and maintenance agreement under which duquesne will pay us for the period from closing through december   for certain defined services related to the equipment 
we use the cost to cost percentage of completion method of accounting for our long term outsourcing contracts which involves our having to estimate revenues and expenses  typically for periods of ten to fifteen years into the future 
during the fourth quarter of  in connection with our normal practice of reviewing estimates for the duquesne contract  and in the first quarter of  in connection with due diligence on the above sale  we determined that we needed to increase our estimates for future costs  primarily for ongoing maintenance and support activities  and to decrease our revenue estimates for future services related to advanced services reads 
we estimate that we will incur approximately million in expenditures between now and december  to complete all remaining obligations to duquesne 
our remaining expenditures will be partially offset by approximately million that we will receive from duquesne over that period for warranty and maintenance services 
in the fourth quarter of  to reflect the changes in estimates for our outsourcing contract as well as obligations under the warranty and maintenance agreement  we recorded a million reduction in outsourcing revenues and accrued an additional million forward loss accrual which is reflected in outsourcing cost of sales 
see additional details on this transaction in revenues above  financial condition below and in note to our accompanying financial statements 
compared to amr systems margins were of amr systems revenues in compared to in and this margin decline is primarily the result of the large network system for the electric utility customer at substantially lower margins and a higher level of installation activities  which tend to have lower margins  in the large lower margin contract was primarily driven by the early life cycle status of our network products and related installation activities at that time 
handheld systems margins of in were significantly better than the experienced in the increased margins in were due to a higher component of total revenues derived from software and services  which tend to have higher margins  and a new higher margin hardware product 
additionally  handheld systems margins were down in because of a lower than average margin sale to a large international customer 
outsourcing margins dropped to in from in the decreased margins were due to a larger portion of outsourcing revenues from our contract with duquesne 
outsourcing revenues in were also largely derived from duquesne revenues  however  overall outsourcing margins in were better than in because one customer converted its outsourcing contract to a purchase that resulted in a one time gain 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased to million from million in the prior year mostly due to increased restructuring charges 
year ended december  increase increase in millions decrease decrease sales and marketing product development general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring charges total operating expenses compared to sales and marketing expenses increased in to represent of revenues  up from of revenues in most of the increased expenses were caused by staff additions for our eis systems product marketing  sales and sales support activities 
as noted above  sales for this market increased in total sales and marketing expenses in are expected to remain relatively flat 
product development expenses decreased from as a result of our restructuring activities 
during we consolidated our handheld  mobile  network and amr telephone development operations into one group  resulting in the closure of development operations in minnesota and california 
we also announced a plan to consolidate our boise  idaho operations  and sharply reduce our european development activities not related to our core business over the course of product development expenses are expected to decline slightly in general and administrative expenses were up in over  primarily from recruiting and relocation expenses 
overall general and administrative expenses are expected to remain relatively level in amortization of intangibles decreased slightly in and is expected to remain approximately level in additional information about operating expenses by business segment is provided in note of our accompanying financial statements 
restructuring restructuring expenses of million in were incurred for severance  facility closures  and the disposition of excess manufacturing equipment see note to our accompanying financial statements 
restructuring actions taken during included consolidation of high volume manufacturing operations from three locations to one  a reduction of meter reading hardware and software platforms supported  and consolidation of geographically diverse development operations  substantial repositioning of operations in europe to reduce the scope of development activities and change from a direct sales approach to one that is more distributor based  and key changes in the executive management team 
approximately people were terminated as part of the restructuring activities  half of which were in manufacturing  in product development  and the rest in sales and marketing  and general and administrative functions 
we expect to replace about manufacturing positions as part of the consolidation of high volume manufacturing operations in our waseca  minnesota plant 
management positions accounted for about of the total staff reductions 
we expect the restructuring measures to reduce annual manufacturing costs by to million with much improved capacity utilization 
we also expect to reduce annual operating expenses by a like amount  however these reductions will be offset by payments of approximately million in project completion bonuses and relocation payments for key personnel  and may be further partially offset by investments in new business initiatives and by incentive compensation  to the extent it is earned based on our financial and operating performance 
we believe our restructuring measures will provide for a return to profitability for the year compared to sales and marketing expenses in decreased million from and decreased as a percentage of revenues from to 
the lower expenses in resulted from a corporate reorganization in that redefined certain jobs previously classified as sales and marketing to general and administrative  and a greater utilization of sales support personnel for revenue producing activities  resulting classification of those expenses as cost of sales 
product development expenses in increased by million  or  over but decreased as a percentage of revenues from to 
the lower expenses as a percent of revenue were caused by restructuring activities in the third quarter of where we eliminated approximately positions  most of which were in product development 
general and administrative expenses in increased approximately  or  over  but decreased as a percentage of revenues to from 
the increased expenses in were primarily due to the reclassification of expenses discussed in sales and marketing above 
restructuring in the third quarter of we began to implement restructuring measures to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
these measures resulted in million in restructuring charges see note to our accompanying financial statements 
restructuring measures involved the elimination or consolidation of approximately positions  primarily product development  the write off of certain intangible assets due to a reduction in the scope of planned technology development  consolidation of some of our facilities and discontinuation of a jointly owned entity 
other income expense year ended december  in millions equity in affiliates gain on sale of business interest interest  net total other income expense over the three year period  we have had a shared ownership interest in three entities  which have been accounted for using the equity method 
these entities provide specialized services  such as installation  load profiling  and meter reading services  or act as distributors for our products in specific utility market segments 
equity in affiliates net operating losses decreased markedly in due to improved sales of products through one entity and curtailed operations of another entity 
in we recorded a million gain on the sale of our ownership interest in a jointly owned entity 
in march  we sold our interest in another entity to our partner for  resulting in a gain of approximately  net interest expense in decreased slightly from due to lower average short term borrowings 
additionally  in the first quarter of we completed an offer to exchange convertible subordinated notes for new notes carrying a lower conversion price 
the offer is described further below under extraordinary item 
the effect of the exchange offer was to reduce the principal amount of outstanding notes  thereby also reducing annual interest expense 
interest expense increased in over due to the original issuance of the convertible subordinated notes 
see note to our accompanying financial statements 
we capitalized  of interest costs in related to the construction of outsourcing projects in that year  down from  capitalized in no interest was capitalized in income taxes the effective income tax rate in decreased to from the rate recorded in and the lower effective rate in resulted from valuation allowances provided for certain domestic tax credits and international net operating losses  which may be subject to expiration before they can be utilized 
our effective income tax rate may vary from year to year because of fluctuations in foreign operating results  changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets  new or revised tax legislation  and changes in the level of business performed in differing tax jurisdictions 
extraordinary item gain on early extinguishment of debt in march we completed an offer exchange offer to exchange million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due exchange notes for million principal amount of original convertible subordinated notes original notes 
the exchange offer was made on the basis of principal amount of exchange notes for  principal amount of original notes 
the exchange notes have substantially the same terms and conditions as the original notes  except for a reduction in the conversion price for converting the notes into common stock  an extension of the date before which we may not call the exchange notes  and the removal of the redemption premium 
the exchange offer reduced our long term debt and annual interest expense by taking advantage of market discounts 
the gain on early debt extinguishment  net of issuance expenses and income taxes  was million 
financial condition year ended december  increase increase cash flow information in millions decrease decrease operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash 
operating activities provided million in compared to consuming million in and million in wages and benefits payable increased million in from restructuring charges for involuntary employee termination benefits that will be paid in restructuring charges for facility closures and cost of sales charges for forward losses on contracts not yet complete will require approximately million in cash in  and million total over subsequent years 
operating cash flow for was much improved over from decreases in unbilled accounts receivable and lower inventory levels 
unbilled accounts receivable are recorded when revenues are recognized upon product shipment or service delivery and invoicing occurs at a later date  and there are no material uncertainties related to system acceptance 
unbilled receivables decreased million in due to the billing and collection of two large  turnkey installations 
further improvements in inventory management across all product lines and locations reduced inventories by million in operating cash flow was offset by deferred income tax benefits for net operating loss carryforwards 
operating activities used less cash in than because of improved inventory management and improved accounts receivables turns 
investing activities required million in  compared to million in and million in construction of the duquesne outsourcing project required significant cash over the three year period 
the sale of the duquesne system in march is expected to reduce investments in equipment used for outsourcing in see additional details on this transaction in revenues and gross margin above and in note to our accompanying financial statements 
we intend to project finance a mobile outsourcing project currently under construction and due to be completed in with long term  fixed rate debt 
the project financing is expected to be approximately million compared to an installed project cost of million  of which we spent million in cash on this project in capital acquisitions for internal use in were approximately level with and are expected to remain level in financing activities required million in mostly due to repayment of short term bank borrowings 
financing cash in was provided from short term bank borrowings and project financing of one outsourcing project 
in we issued million of convertible subordinated notes payable  the proceeds from which were used primarily to repay short term bank borrowings 
the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases provided cash of million in  million in  and million in in january  we signed an agreement with a bank for a new four year revolving line of credit up to a maximum amount of million 
as with the previous line of credit  borrowings available under the new facility are based on accounts receivable and inventory 
availability under the new line of credit has decreased since the end of the year primarily due to lower levels of accounts receivable 
we expect to collect approximately million in cash from the sale of the duquesne system in march or april of the cash received will be used to repay any short term borrowings  cover the cash needs of restructuring measures discussed above  and for general corporate purposes 
some portion of excess cash  if any  may be used to retire long term debt or to repurchase stock 
management believes that the cash to be received from the duquesne sale  the new borrowing facility  project financing proceeds and cash to be generated from operations are more than adequate to meet our needs for year compliance none of our products  internal business systems  or suppliers incurred any significant problems related to the year rollover 
our total spending to address year issues was approximately million 
certain forward looking statements when included in this discussion  the words expects  intends  anticipates  plans  projects and estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements  are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  among others  our ability to complete negotiations with duquesne for the systems sale  our ability to accurately forecast future revenues and costs on long term contracts  our estimates of the future impact of restructuring measures  changes in law and regulation including fcc licensing actions  changes in the utility regulatory environment  delays or difficulties in introducing new products and acceptance of those products  ability to obtain project financing in amounts necessary to fund future outsourcing agreements  increased competition and various other matters  many of which are beyond our control 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement contained herein to reflect any change on the company s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based 
for a more complete description of these and other risks  see our annual report of form k for the year ended december  item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to interest rate risk from our short term and long term debt 
our long term debt is fixed rate and the short term debt is variable rate 
we had million and million of long term debt at december  and  respectively 
see note of our accompanying financial statement for additional information on its short term and long term borrowings 
market risk for fixed rate long term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis points increase in interest rates and amounts to million as of december  we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
from time to time  we enter into forward contracts on known purchase commitments in foreign currencies and for inter company settlements 
we do not enter into derivatives for trading purposes 
as of december  we did not have any outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar  as compared to foreign currencies  as a result of transactions in foreign markets 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated 
as of december   the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or on the fair value of our risk sensitive financial instruments 
the model assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency  consequently  actual effects on operations in the future may differ materially from that analysis
