quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company develops products in the united states and sells them worldwide 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since the company s sales are currently priced in us dollars and translated into local currency amounts  a strengthening of the dollar could make the company s products less competitive in foreign markets 
the company operates a subsidiary in the united kingdom which incurs expenses denominated in its local currency 
however  the company believes that these operating expenses will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the company s investments are in short term instruments and the company s available line of credit requires interest payments calculated at variable rates 
based on the nature and current levels of the company s investments and debt  however  the company believes that there is no material market risk or exposure 
the company s general investing policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting credit and market risk 
the company currently places its investments in highly liquid money market accounts and short term investments 
all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents
