year issue the year statement which follows is a year readiness disclosure  pursuant to the year information and readiness disclosure act  public law no 
the company recognized the need to ensure year software and embedded system failures would not adversely impact its operations 
specifically  computational errors and system failures were a known risk with respect to dates after december  the company established a central yk compliance office that reported directly to the chief information officer 
each of the company s operating units also designated information technology it personnel to address the issues that the unit faced and to report to the central yk compliance office 
the company implemented a system which allowed it to track all it and non it systems and facility functions for compliance with industry yk standards 
this tracking system allowed the company to monitor and track each functional point as a single item grouped by how critical the item was in the company s ability to perform its daily functions 
based on the output from this data and an analysis of the system reports  the company believed that all functional points which were critical to the company s functions had been identified and assessed 
further  the company developed a remediation plan for each item in the critical list 
part of the company s remediation strategy was in concert with its efforts to acquire or develop new and innovative systems for its internal operations 
the company has transitioned into the year with no major impact on our commitment to servicing our clients 
in instances where minor incidents were reported  contingency plans were invoked and service levels to our clients were maintained 
these minor occurrences had no impact on day to day operations and have since been repaired with no financial impact 
it issues 
internal systems represented approximately of the overall effort in the it applications area 
the remaining of the overall effort in the it area was in the interface and integration of external client and vendor application systems 
the company implemented a three step process of contacting significant vendors and clients to request information about the status of their yk compliance efforts 
in addition to communicating with significant vendors  the company tested certain critical vendor application systems for yk compliance 
the company identified mitigation and contingency plans at both the business and technical it levels 
in addition to communicating with significant clients  the company had a strategy to deal with non compliant external client customer data by enabling data to be used by the company s systems 
non it issues facilities 
non it issues  with few exceptions  had been classified into a non critical category 
the few exceptions included dial tone for the company s telephony and power from the company s energy providers 
the company included these functional points in the critical category for purposes of scheduling 
based on communications with the providers of these services  the company believed that these services would not be interrupted by year failures 
the company s contingency plan for the loss of power included generator systems in the company s major facilities 
the company s contingency plan for loss of dial tone included the distribution of network services across several providers 
this would allow the company to minimally maintain its service levels in the event of a failure 
phases 
the company employed a four phase  nine process step project methodology that covered each aspect of yk compliance 
the four phases are phase assessment phase remediation phase verification and testing phase implementation each process step is necessary within the framework and provides clear management checkpoints for gauging the progress of activity during execution of the project plan 
the following table outlines the phases and process steps phase phase phase phase verification process steps assessment remediation testing implementation recognition awareness x x x x inventory x evaluation x determination x remediation x re engineering x multi level testing x x x x implementation x post implementation x the company clearly defined each of the process steps in the project methodology 
the recognition awareness step included communication of the yk issues and their importance throughout the company 
the inventory step included the identification and cataloging of each item that must be verified for compliance with yk processing 
the evaluation step involved the evaluation and categorization of the critical nature of each item based on established criteria 
the determination step included making informed management decisions regarding the strategy to be taken for each individual item 
the remediation step involved repair of all components of a process that could improperly process dates 
the re engineering step consisted of rewriting and or replacing whole units of software code 
the multi level testing step involved the development of detailed testing criteria and the implementation of those testing plans 
the implementation step involved the coordination of the release of applications systems into the live systems environment 
the post implementation step included the on going monitoring of applications systems that have been repaired and placed into the live systems environment 
contingency plans 
the company developed year business contingency plans for conducting its business operations in the event of crises 
this effort was not limited to the risks posed by the potential year failures of the company s internal information systems or infrastructures  but also included the potential secondary impact on the company of year failures  including potential systems failures of business partners and infrastructure service providers 
costs of yk compliance 
the company estimates that the costs to become yk compliant approximate million 
substantially all of these costs have been incurred through december  minor internal costs will be incurred in the first quarter of in connection with monitoring the impact of the year change on systems and operations and winding down the yk project office 
quarterly results and seasonality the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience quarterly variations in its results of operations principally due to the timing of clients customer relationship management initiatives and teleservicing campaigns and the commencement and terms of new contracts  revenue mix  and the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to support new business 
the company experiences periodic fluctuations related to both the start up costs associated with expansion and the implementation of clients customer relationship management activities 
in addition  the company s business tends to be slower in the third quarter due to summer holidays in europe and  to a lesser degree  in the first quarter due to the changeover of client marketing strategies that often occur at the beginning of the year 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operations 
however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not have a material effect on the company s operations in the future
