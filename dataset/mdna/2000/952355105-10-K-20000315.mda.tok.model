overview the company is a leading provider of teleservices to businesses on an outsourced basis 
the company believes it has established a distinct competitive advantage in its ability to offer a range of services through its three operating divisions inbound  interactive and outbound on a fully integrated basis 
revenue inbound services represented approximately of total revenue for the year ended december  revenue for inbound services is primarily generated at the time calls are answered by a telemarketing representative based on the number of calls and or minutes received and processed on behalf of clients 
inbound services also generates revenue from calls transferred to telemarketing representatives from interactive voice response units and by providing assistance to clients in the design and implementation of new applications 
interactive services represented approximately of total revenue for the year ended december  revenue for interactive services is primarily generated at the time calls are received or sent by automated voice response units and is billed based on call duration 
outbound services represented approximately of total revenue for the year ended december  revenue for outbound services is generated generally on an hourly basis based on the time the marketing representatives place calls to consumers on behalf of clients 
outbound services also generate revenue by providing assistance to clients in the design and programming of customized applications 
expenses costs of telecommunications services incurred by the company are primarily comprised of long distance transmission charges 
the company effectively manages its telecommunications costs through a long term services contract with at t which includes an established rate schedule subject to certain call volume commitments 
as one of at t s largest clients  the company believes it has negotiated a favorable contract at an attractive service rate 
the company has also entered into a number of equipment maintenance and network management contracts with at t in order to facilitate reliable and efficient network operations 
rates for telecommunications services are primarily determined by total call volume  level of network management and technical support under contract 
the company manages its direct labor costs through its flexible staffing and scheduling initiatives 
in particular  the company has developed its own proprietary scheduling systems which are designed to optimize staffing and pay levels in anticipation of fluctuating call volumes as clients campaigns are scheduled 
the company seeks to control its direct labor costs by decentralizing its operations and by seeking new geographic markets which offer attractive labor market characteristics for its inbound and outbound services 
direct labor rates fluctuate based upon local market factors such as the size and availability of a part time workforce in addition to local economic growth 
labor rates are adjusted  as necessary  to attract the required number of service representatives during seasonal fluctuations 
during the year ended december   the company experienced improvement in direct costs as a percentage of revenue due in part to more favorable labor rates realized by entering new local markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all expenses that support the ongoing operation of the company 
these expenses include costs related to division management  facilities costs  equipment depreciation and maintenance  amortization of goodwill  allowance for doubtful accounts  sales and marketing activities  client support services  and corporate management costs 
changes in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily reflect the addition of new facilities over certain periods or expanded marketing activities 
prior to the reorganization in november  inbound  interactive and outbound elected to be treated as small business corporations for income tax purposes 
under this election  all income and expense flowed through to the stockholders on a pro rata basis for income tax purposes 
accordingly  no provision for actual income taxes had been provided for during this period except for certain state taxes  which were applicable to small business corporations 
prior to the closing of the company s initial public offering and simultaneously with the reorganization  the subsidiary companies terminated their small business corporation status and became subject to federal and state income taxes
