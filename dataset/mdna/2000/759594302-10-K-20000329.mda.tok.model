item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion will assist you in understanding our financial position  liquidity  and results of operations 
the information below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  and the related notes to financial statements 
our discussion contains both historical and forward looking information 
we assess the risks and uncertainties about our business  long term strategy  and financial condition before we make any forward looking statements  but we can not guarantee that our assessment is accurate or that our goals and projections can or will be met 
statements concerning results of future exploration  exploitation  development  and acquisition expenditures as well as expense and reserve levels are forward looking statements 
we make assumptions about commodity prices  drilling results  production costs  administrative expenses  and interest costs that we believe are reasonable based on currently available information of known facts and trends 
long term strategy and business developments our long term strategy is to increase shareholder value by economically increasing reserves  production  and cash flow on an annual basis 
we will balance our capital expenditures  financed primarily by operating cash flow and bank debt  among exploration  development  and acquisitions 
proved oil and gas reserves at december   were million barrels of oil and bcf of gas compared to million barrels of oil and bcf of gas at december  these results amount to a increase in oil reserves  a increase in gas reserves  and a growth in total barrels of oil equivalents 
in  we replaced of our total production and in  we replaced of our total production  based on barrels of oil equivalent 
during the last three years  we have concentrated on reducing our costs and expenses to increase shareholder value 
phillips petroleum litigation phillips contends that pursuant to its net profits interest in south pass block  it was entitled to receive an overriding royalty for months in which net profits were not achieved  that an excessive oil transportation fee was being charged to the net profits account  and that the entire million cash payment that had been received by okc limited partnership our predecessor from the settlement of previous litigation between texas eastern transmission corporation and us  should have been credited to the net profits account instead of the million that was credited 
on the latter claim  phillips seeks to receive more than million  while on the first two claims phillips alleges aggregate damages of several million dollars 
in addition  phillips  under the louisiana mineral code  is seeking double damages and cancellation of the farm out agreement that created the net profits interest 
we denied phillips claims and defended ourselves during a non jury trial in april in august  the trial court ruled in the litigation 
in its ruling  the court awarded phillips million plus interest for its overriding royalty claim and million plus interest for its claim on the settlement 
the trial court dismissed phillips claim of excessive transportation charges and its claims for double damages and lease cancellation 
the trial court  applying federal law and the language of the farm out agreement  held that only income from actual production was to be included in the net profits account 
on this basis  the trial court allocated million of the settlement amount to proceeds from production rather than the million originally credited 
in october  the trial court finalized its judgment 
the total judgment  including interest  was million 
phillips appealed the judgment on the transportation issue and the judgment on the settlement  and we appealed the decision on the overriding royalty issue 
we posted an million appeal bond  and set aside million with the bonding company as collateral for the bond 
in addition  we recorded the million as an expense in the third quarter of in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
entitled accounting for contingencies 
on january   the fourth court of appeal issued an opinion reversing the trial court s judgment on the settlement issue and the excessive transportation issue and upholding the judgment on the overriding royalty issue 
the appellate opinion increased the amount of the settlement subject to net profits from the million as allocated by the trial court to million  an increase of million 
the appeals court remanded this amount to the trial court for further proceedings related to royalties due 
the amount payable to phillips as determined by the appellate court  subject to remand  and assuming no reversal  would be million plus interest 
the appellate court opinion also disagreed with the trial court in stating that we owe phillips million plus interest on the transportation issue 
in addition  according to the appellate court s opinion  we would owe phillips an additional million plus interest for transportation costs from december through the end of we intend to vigorously contest the decision of the appellate court  and in january we requested a rehearing in this case 
if the rehearing is denied  we will appeal to the louisiana supreme court 
because we believe that it is probable that the decision of the appellate court will not stand  we have not recorded any additional contingent liability on our books 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
entitled accounting for contingencies requires that when a loss contingency exists  it be accrued if it is reasonably estimable and it is probable that an unfavorable outcome will occur 
in reaching our conclusion we rely on our legal counsel who have informed us that in their opinions  the appellate court incorrectly applied the law and made erroneous findings of fact in reversing the trial court s judgment and that it is as likely as not that the court of appeal s errors will be corrected on rehearing or on appeal to the louisiana supreme court 
if however  we are not successful in this litigation  after exhausting all appeals  we will owe phillips approximately million plus approximately million in interest on all three issues 
this result would have a serious effect on our financial position and liquidity and could constitute an event of default under our bank loan agreement  which might result in acceleration of our long term debt 
our plans to deal with such a contingency might include selling properties  additional debt financing or  as a last resort  seeking protection from creditors under applicable law 
we also have litigation pending with phillips in state court in collin county  texas 
this litigation centers on our termination of the gas contract with texas eastern in for million  and what  if any  of the termination amount we received should be credited to the net profits account 
the court in collin county stayed the case pending resolution of the louisiana appeals 
although not absolute  an unfavorable outcome of the louisiana litigation could have a detrimental effect on our position in this litigation 
if we were unsuccessful in this litigation we could owe phillips approximately million plus approximately million in interest through december  this litigation could take up to two years to resolve after the louisiana litigation is concluded 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as amended  the statement is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  january  for us 
sfas no 
requires that derivatives be reported on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value must be recognized in the income statement in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined to be effective  changes in fair value are either offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the income statement when the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the definition of derivatives has also been expanded to include contracts that require physical delivery of oil and gas if the contract allows for net cash settlement 
currently we do not utilize any derivative instruments that fall under the criteria defined in the accounting standard 
accordingly  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our reported financial statements or disclosures 
liquidity and capital resources on december   our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by million 
excluding the phillips judgment payable from current liabilities and the million of restricted cash related thereto from current assets would result in our current assets exceeding our current liabilities by million 
from december   to december   our current assets decreased by million 
the current assets decreased primarily because we used cash to purchase million of the convertible subordinated notes and our capital expenditures exceeded our cash flow from operations during cash flow from operations for decreased million  or  compared to the decrease relates to the cash received from the termination of a gas contract with texas eastern transmission corporation 
we received million in cash in july for the termination 
without the proceeds from the termination of the gas contract  cash flow from operations would have increased by million  or 
this increase resulted from higher average oil prices and increased gas production 
the average oil prices for were per barrel compared to per barrel during the higher oil prices caused oil revenues to be million higher in total gas production increased by in compared to the increased production added million to total oil and gas revenues 
during  we appealed certain orders to pay from the minerals management service 
the appeal required us to post a bond for the total amount of their claim for underpaid royalties 
we set aside million as restricted cash collateral on the bonds 
the recent increase in oil prices has a positive impact on total revenues  net income  and cash flow from operations 
based on this increase and an expected increase in production  our current projections indicate that we can finance the majority of our planned capital expenditures in through our cash flow from operations 
we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures over the next several years as part of our long term growth strategy 
the primary source of funding the capital expenditures will be net cash flow from operations and additional bank debt 
we have budgeted million for capital expenditures in while we have projected this amount for capital expenditures  we can delay or cancel the drilling of wells included in the current capital expenditure budget 
in february  we replaced our existing line of credit with a line of credit from a different bank 
the line of credit had a borrowing base of million and expires in in march  the bank amended the terms of the line of credit to increase the borrowing base to million 
we pledged our oil and gas properties as collateral for the increased line of credit and agreed not to pay dividends 
in february  we borrowed million on the line of credit and used the majority of the proceeds to buy a portion of the convertible notes 
during we borrowed an additional million which we used for capital expenditures 
the bank will review the borrowing base semi annually and may increase or decrease the borrowing base relative to a new determination of the estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
year issue we did not experience any problems related to the year issue 
our expenses related to the year issue were insignificant 
results of operations in  we recorded a net loss totaling million or per share compared to net income of million or per share diluted income per share in the decrease in net income resulted primarily from lower revenues because of the termination of the gas contract with texas eastern in july increased oil prices and increased gas production during partially offset the decrease in total revenues from to the following table discloses the net oil and gas production volumes  sales  and sales prices for each of the three years ended december    and the table is an integral part of the following discussion of results of operations for the periods compared to and compared to increase increase decrease decrease oil production volume mbbls    oil sales revenue    price per barrel increase decrease in oil sales revenue due to change in prices   change in production volume total increase decrease in oil sales revenue   gas production volume mmcf    gas sales revenue    price per mcf increase decrease in gas sales revenue due to change in prices   change in production volume   total increase decrease in gas sales revenue   compared to oil revenue increased by million in compared to the prior year primarily because of the increase in the average price 
oil production from the three gulf of mexico offshore platforms in the south pass area decreased mbbls because of depletion of reserves from existing wells 
however  oil production from other gulf of mexico properties increased by mbbls and partially offset the decrease from the south pass area 
in addition  oil production from mississippi increased by approximately mbbls 
the net reduction in oil production decreased total oil revenues by  gas revenues for increased by million primarily because of the increase in gas production 
gas production from the offshore gulf of mexico increased by approximately bcf 
gas production from the south texas gulf coast increased by approximately bcf 
these volume increases  which resulted in about million in additional revenue  were substantially offset by lower unit prices which reduced revenues by approximately million 
the average price decreased because during the first half of we sold gas produced from south pass block under a gas sales contract at above market prices 
we terminated the gas contract in july interest income decreased  because of lower cash and investments balances throughout compared to other income decreased because in august we received million from texas eastern corporation to terminate the south pass block gas sales contract 
operating expenses increased by million  or  because of the increase in the number of producing properties during transportation expenses decreased because we purchased s sixteen holding company in december we eliminated the transportation expense in the consolidation of ckb petroleum  inc net profits expense decreased million because of lower production volumes and the termination of the texas eastern gas sales contract in july the termination of the gas sales contract caused gas revenues from south pass block to decrease significantly 
exploration expenses decreased by million  or  because of lower dry hole costs and lower d seismic costs incurred during compared to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased because of increased producing properties and production 
however  because our per unit finding and development costs have decreased  our per unit depreciation  depletion and amortization amounts have decreased 
in  impairment of oil and gas properties decreased million from the prior year 
in we recorded a million impairment charge on the south pass block property as a result of the termination of the gas sales contract 
during the third quarter of  we received a judgment against us for million in the phillips litigation 
we recorded the judgment during the third quarter of and have continued to record interest on the judgment amount 
in february  we reached an agreement to settle the litigation with the two minority shareholders of ckb associates  inc and ckb petroleum  inc 
in addition  as part of the settlement agreement  we purchased their minority interest in the two subsidiaries in march we recorded the estimated expense portion of the settlement as a charge against income in the fourth quarter of compared to oil revenue for  decreased million because of a  or  decrease in prices  partially offset by a  barrel  or  increase in oil production 
the lower prices alone caused oil revenue to be million lower 
oil production increased primarily because of additional oil production from the parker creek property in mississippi and the west buna property in south texas 
gas revenue for was million  or  lower than  primarily due to the lower production from south pass block in compared to the prior year 
in  production from this block was bcf lower than in  causing a decrease in gas revenue of approximately million 
the average gas price decrease  from to  resulted primarily from the termination of the gas sales contract on south pass block we sold gas from south pass block at an average price of per mcf in compared to in gas production from properties other than south pass block increased  mcf  or  primarily from eugene island block in the gulf of mexico 
other income increased primarily because of the million received from the termination of the gas sales contract 
operating costs increased during compared to because the number of our producing properties increased significantly 
net profits expense decreased in because of the decreased revenues credited to the net profits account on south pass block exploration expense increased  or  primarily due to increased expenditures for d seismic data 
dry hole expense  which is included in exploration expense  included million for costs accumulated on the main pass block well a at december  this well was determined to be non commercial during the first quarter of depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased by million  or  because of an increase in proved oil and gas reserves on producing properties 
the impairment expense recorded in includes million for impairment on south pass block platform b that was recorded in the third quarter of due to the termination of the gas sales contract 
in connection with the august judgment issued in our litigation with phillips petroleum company  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
entitled accounting for contingencies  we recorded an million expense in august this amount includes the damage award by the trial court and the estimated interest on the award 
we reduced general and administrative expense by in compared to the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily from reduced salaries and payroll expense  rent expense  and professional services fees 
legal expenses decreased because of the reduction in expense associated with defending the phillips petroleum company litigation and the settlement of other litigation 
reorganization expense for includes payments to employees under employee severance agreements and legal fees or other charges that relate to or were paid because of the purchase of s sixteen holding company formerly box brothers holding company by mr

simplot in august we recorded the following as reorganization costs employee severance payments million  thomas d 
box severance and legal claims and fees million  mr 
simplot and mr 
james arthur lyle million for legal claims and fees  and other associated expenses  interest expense is lower for because of our purchase of million of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes in october in  we recorded a valuation allowance against the entire deferred tax benefit  and reflected the amount in the income statement as deferred income tax expense 
in  we were able to use those tax benefits to the extent that our effective federal income tax rate for was about 
the income tax expense for includes alternative minimum tax expense of  as a current income tax expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk sensitive instrument at december   is a revolving line of credit from a bank 
at december   the unpaid principal balance under the line was million 
the interest rate on this debt is sensitive to market fluctuations  however we do not believe that significant fluctuations in the market interest have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flow from operations
