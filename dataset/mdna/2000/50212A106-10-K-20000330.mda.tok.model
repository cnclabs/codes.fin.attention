the company has also provided services under subcontracts for projects in jamaica  the philippines and for the us immigration and naturalization service 
the company began operations in as a division of lau technologies lau  a provider of systems integration services and products for sophisticated electronic systems 
in november  lau transferred substantially all of the assets  liabilities and operations of the division to the company and the company completed its initial public offering 
the company is currently a owned subsidiary of lau 
effective june   the company reorganized its operations to create a separate biometrics division to respond to the growing market interest in biometric solutions 
the biometrics division is focused on product  market and channel development activities in three principal areas facility access control  pc network and internet access security  and real time large database identification and verification of individuals 
the systems integration and identification card division si division focuses on viisage s public sector markets and serves as a channel to existing customers and the public sector for the company s biometric technologies 
the company believes that it is in the early stages of an emerging and high growth market for biometric identification solutions  particularly facial recognition solutions in the government and commercial markets 
the company is engaged in one business  the development and implementation of digital identification systems and solutions 
as discussed above  since june   the company has operated in two segments 
amounts for the biometrics division prior to the reorganization are not material or meaningful 
the si division provides systems and services principally under contracts that have five to seven year terms and provide for several annual renewals after the initial contract term 
contracts generally provide for a fixed price for the system and or for each card produced 
contract prices vary depending on  among other things  design and integration complexities  the nature and number of workstations and sites  the projected number of cards to be produced  the size of the database  the level of post installation support and the competitive environment 
substantially all of the company s revenues are currently derived from the si division s public sector customers and contractors to such customers 
the company believes for the foreseeable future that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of large contracts 
for the years ended december   and  four customers  three customers and one customer  respectively  each accounted for more than of the company s revenues and an aggregate of  and of revenues for each of the years  respectively 
the company s results of operations are significantly affected by  among other things  the timing of award and performance on contracts 
as a result  the company s revenues and income may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  and comparisons over longer periods of time may be more meaningful 
the company s results of operations are not seasonal since contracts are awarded and performed throughout the year 
however  the company believes its public sector business is subject to cyclical procurement delays that may be related to state wide election cycles 
biometric division revenues have not been material to date and operations are not expected to be seasonal 
results of operations year ended december  and revenues are derived principally from multi year contracts for system implementation  card production and related services

the company elected early adoption of statement of position no 
sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which requires start up costs to be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized 
the company previously capitalized certain start up costs as pre contract costs under sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and charged such costs to contracts upon award 
as required  the adoption of sop has been made effective as of the beginning of the year 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of  was recorded as a one time charge in the company s results for the year 
project costs also include start up costs of  which were incurred in the first quarter of revenues 
si division revenues are derived principally from systems implementation  card production and related services under multi year contracts

interest expense 
the increase in net interest expense to million for from  for reflects increased borrowings during and a reduction in interest earned on cash equivalents in income taxes 
the company did not record any tax benefit for the or losses due to the uncertainty of whether such benefit will be realized 
liquidity and capital resources cash and equivalents were million at december   an increase of million from december  the increase is primarily the result of cash generated by operating and financing activities 
these cash inflows were largely offset by cash outflows for investing activities 
accounts receivable decreased from december  to december  day s sales outstanding in receivables improved to days at december  from days at december  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings increased from december  to december   which reflects the impact of additional business volume that will be billable in the future 
historically  the company has not made substantial capital expenditures for facilities  office and computer equipment  instead  satisfying its needs in these areas principally through leasing 
the company has a revolving credit facility with a commercial bank that provides for borrowings of up to million through december  and million through june  at the prime rate plus 
the revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum levels of earnings and tangible capital funds  as defined 
at december   the company was in compliance with all loan covenants 
the revolving credit facility also requires the company to raise funds  as needed  from other sources to cover biometrics division expenses 
these sources are expected to include a combination of biometrics division revenues  subordinated debt and equity capital 
in march  the company received a two year commitment letter from a commercial bank to provide a new revolving credit facility to the company through april in connection with the bank s commitment  the revolving credit facility is amended to provide for borrowings of up to million at the prime rate plus 
the facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum levels of earnings and tangible capital funds  as defined 
the accompanying financial statements reflect this commitment as of december  the company also has a system project lease financing arrangement with a commercial leasing organization 
pursuant to this arrangement  the lessor purchases certain of our digital identification systems and leases them back to the company for deployment with identified and contracted customers approved by the lessor 
the lessor retains title to the systems and has an assignment of the company s rights under the related customer contracts  including rights to use the software and technology underlying the related systems 
under this arrangement  the lessor bears the credit risk associated with payments by the company s customers  but the company bears performance and appropriation risk and is generally required to repurchase a system in the event of a termination by a customer for any reason except credit default 
the company is also required to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum levels of tangible capital funds  as defined 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all lease covenants 
these project lease arrangements are accounted for as capital leases 
the current arrangement provides for project financing of up to million 
at december   the company had approximately million outstanding under the lease financing arrangement 
the company has a similar lease financing arrangement with lau that provides for up to million of capital lease financing in with million outstanding at december  the company believes that it will continue to meet its debt covenants 
however  this expectation is dependent in part on achieving business forecasts and raising funds to cover biometrics division expenses 
if the company does not meet such covenants  the bank and the lessor could require immediate repayment of amounts outstanding 
in may  the company received a commitment from lau to lend up to million in exchange for a convertible subordinated note 
amounts drawn under the note  with lau s consent  and related accrued interest are convertible at lau s option into shares of the company s common stock at any time prior to january  at per share

the company has agreed to register for resale the common stock underlying the preferred shares  related dividends and warrants 
this transaction was an exempt transaction under section of the securities act of  as amended 
in connection with this transaction  the company paid an investment banking fee of  and warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock  exercisable for three years  at an exercise price of per share which was of the then current closing price of the company s common stock 
the company also issued warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock  exercisable for three years  at an exercise price of per share to the investor 
on december   warrants issued through the placement of the series a preferred stock were exercised at for the purchase of  shares of common stock 
in january  shares of series a preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock 
on march   for an initial investment of  of which  is to be funded following the registration of the offered securities with the commission  the company agreed to issue to a private equity investor  shares of common stock  closing warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock  exercisable for five years at per share  and adjustable warrants  exercisable at nominal consideration during three trading day periods beginning four months following closing which may be delayed to december  
the adjustable warrants terminate if the market value of the company common stock exceeds for any consecutive trading days prior to the adjustment periods 
if not terminated  the number of shares that may be acquired under the adjustable warrants is determined by a formula that is dependent on the extent to which the market value of the company s common stock is less than per share during the adjustment periods 
subject to certain closing conditions  two additional investments of  each may be invested by the same investor between and days after the initial investment and between and days thereafter on similar terms 
the purchase price of the common stock for each additional investment will be equal of the average per share market value for the ten trading days prior to the applicable closing date and the closing warrants will equal to of each investment at an exercise price equal to of the average per share market price for the five trading days prior to such closing date 
the termination amount for the subsequent adjustable warrants will be of the market value of the common stock on the applicable closing date and the formula amount will be set at of such market value 
the company believes that if it meets its business forecast for  cash flows from available borrowings  project leasing  operations and capital raising will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional capital will be available on favorable terms or at all 
inflation although certain of the company s expenses increase with general inflation in the economy  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s financial results to date 
accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires companies to recognize all derivative contracts at their fair values as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
historically  the company has not entered into derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes 
accordingly  the company does not expect the adoption of the new standard to affect its financial statements
