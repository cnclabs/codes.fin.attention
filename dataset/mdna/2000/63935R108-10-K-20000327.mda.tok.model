item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the company provides corporate travel management services and  to a more limited extent  other travel services  throughout the united states  in canada and in the united kingdom 
the company s consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the four business combinations accounted for under the pooling of interests method during the period from january through april the pooled companies and includes the results of operations for the seven companies acquired in business combinations in accounted for under the purchase method the purchased companies  the eight companies acquired in business combinations in accounted for under the purchase method the purchased companies and the ten companies acquired in business combinations in accounted for under the purchase method the purchased companies from their respective dates of acquisition 
sources of revenue historically  arrangements between corporate travel management companies and their clients generally did not provide for any direct compensation from clients for travel bookings and services completed on their behalf 
consequently  corporate travel management companies were largely dependent for their revenues on the point of sale percentage commissions paid by the airlines for each ticket issued and to a lesser extent on hotel and car rental commissions 
in  the airlines instituted a commission cap of on round trip domestic tickets and on one way domestic tickets 
in october  the airlines cut the base commission on domestic and international tickets from to of the ticket price 
the company and other travel management companies were significantly affected by these commission reductions  particularly the october reduction  which resulted in a decrease in gross revenue per transaction 
in october  the airlines instituted a commission cap of on round trip international tickets and on one way international tickets 
most recently  in october  the airlines further cut the base commission on domestic and international tickets from to of the ticket price 
the previous commission caps of on round trip domestic tickets and on one way domestic tickets and on round trip international tickets and on one way international tickets remained in effect 
in response to the reduction in airline commissions and consistent with growing industry practice  the company has entered into management contracts and service fee arrangements with a significant number of its clients 
although the terms of the company s management contracts vary depending on the type of services provided and by client  the company typically deducts a pre negotiated management fee  its direct operating expenses and its indirect overhead costs from commissions collected for travel arrangements made on behalf of the client 
if the commissions do not exceed the amounts deducted  the client pays the difference to the company 
if the commissions exceed the amounts deducted  the company typically pays the excess to the client 
in addition  the company typically charges a service fee for each ticket and other transactions to clients who do not have a management contract with the company 
the company charges between and for each air travel ticket issued to such clients and retains all of the related commissions collected from the airlines 
the company believes that its management contracts and service fee arrangements should minimize the financial impact of the above noted commission caps  as well as any future changes in the airline commission rates 
the company believes that at least of its total transactions are currently generated from clients under management contracts and service fee arrangements and expects this percentage to increase to to during the early part of as contracts are renegotiated 
the company has entered into agreements with major airlines for the payment of incentive override commissions in addition to the base commissions described above 
under these agreements  the airlines generally pay additional commissions on domestic and international air travel if the volume of the company s ticket sales surpasses specified thresholds  which typically are based on the airlines share of the relevant markets 
additionally  the company has negotiated favorable contracts with selected computer reservation systems vendors  hotel commission clearinghouses  and rental car companies 
some of these contracts provide payments to the company of up front fees or annual payments or cost savings to navigant 
expenses the company s direct operating expenses include principally labor which comprised approximately and of total direct operating expenses in and  respectively  net commission payments to clients under management contracts  communication costs and other costs associated with the selling and processing of travel reservations 
the company s general and administrative expenses include principally labor which comprised approximately and of total general and administrative expenses in and  respectively  occupancy and other costs 
non recurring charges the company incurred non recurring acquisition costs of million during in connection with the acquisition of the pooled companies 
these non recurring charges included accounting  legal and investment banking fees  real estate and environmental assessments and appraisals and various regulatory fees 
non recurring charges during  the company incurred the following non recurring charges cash non cash total in thousands prior to or in conjunction with the distribution impaired goodwill march operation consolidation allocated charges associated with the distribution    subsequent to the distribution operational consolidation and elimination of redundant facilities   total non recurring charges    on march   the company received days notice of termination of a business relationship that contributed approximately  to net operating income during in march  the company wrote off  in intangible assets relating to the original acquisition of this contract 
in addition to this charge  the company took a charge in april of approximately  in connection with the disposition of certain equipment  severance charges and other costs associated with a change in operational strategy to a centralized management structure at one of its locations 
this switch to a centralized management structure from a regional structure at this location is consistent with the existing structure at the other regional travel management companies acquired 
the company incurred strategic restructuring costs of million in connection with the travel distribution as an allocation from us office products 
of this amount  million was an allocation to the company for a portion of the strategic restructuring charge incurred by us office products and the remaining million was as a result of us office products company s purchase of a pro rata portion of the company s stock options pursuant to a tender offer made in connection with the travel distribution 
of the million  million was recorded as a non cash compensation charge while the  relates to the company s portion of payroll taxes on the compensation 
as part of the company s increased focus on operational matters subsequent to the travel distribution  it undertook a formal plan approved by its board of directors for cost reduction measures including the elimination of duplicative facilities  the consolidation of certain operating functions and the deployment of common information systems 
the implementation of the cost reduction measures commenced in november and resulted in the company recording a restructuring charge of million in november and december the charge included the closure of facilities  the sale of one building and the severance associated with the termination of employees 
through december  facilities have been closed or consolidated and employees have been terminated 
the following table summarizes non recurring charges associated with the cost reduction plan and sets forth their usage for the periods indicated employee severance and facility termination closures and costs consolidations total in thousands charge    payments non cash usage balance at december  payments   non cash usage additional expense recorded during balance at december  non recurring charges in february  the company undertook a formal plan approved by the board of directors for further cost reduction measures including the consolidation of certain operating functions on a regional basis and the elimination of duplicative facilities 
the implementation of the cost reduction measures commenced in march and resulted in the company recording a restructuring charge of approximately million in march management anticipates that these measures will be completed throughout the charge includes the severance associated with the termination of approximately positions and the merger of several facilities 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with navigant s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in the annual report

non recurring costs operating income interest expense  net other income expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes income before minority interest consolidated results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  consolidated revenues increased  from million for to million for this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the revenues from the and purchased companies from their respective dates of acquisition  which added approximately million in consolidated revenues 
additionally  the company has increased revenues in through improved national contracts with certain of its vendors and internal growth 
operating expenses increased  from million  or of revenues  for to million  or of revenues  for the decrease in operating expense as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to the spreading of certain fixed operating expenses over a larger revenue base and an increase in revenue from certain vendors  due to the company s negotiation of improved national contracts with these vendors 
general and administrative expenses increased  from million  or of revenues  for to million  or of revenues  for the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to the and purchased companies having lower general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues than the company and as a result of spreading certain fixed general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base 
additionally  the company has begun implementing integration efforts to reduce redundant facilities and functions  resulting in a decrease in general and administrative expenses during depreciation and amortization expense increased  from million  or of revenues  for to million  or of revenues  for this increase was due to the increase in the number of purchase acquisitions and the resultant higher goodwill amortization included in the results for compared to the company did not incur any non recurring charges in compared to million during see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction non recurring charges

additionally  the pooled companies were not subject to federal income taxes on a corporate level prior to being acquired by navigant as they had elected to be treated as subchapter s corporations subchapter s companies  resulting in minimal income tax expense during the period from january through april liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash of million  excluding restricted cash in navigantvacations

the company s capitalization  defined as the sum of long term debt and stockholders equity at december  was approximately million 
the company has financed its operational growth and acquisitions primarily from internally generated cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility 
these borrowings are secured by the accounts receivable and other assets of the company 
the company anticipates that its cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will provide sufficient cash to enable the company to meet its working capital needs  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures for property and equipment through at least fiscal based on current budgets 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million

in august  the company obtained the credit facility  a secured million revolving credit facility to replace the company s previous million revolving credit facility and a million short term bridge loan agreement 
the credit facility is available for working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions  subject to compliance with the applicable covenants 
the credit facility is scheduled to expire in august interest on borrowings under the credit facility accrues at a rate of  at the company s option  either i libor plus a margin of between and  depending on the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio  or ii the alternative base rate defined as the higher of x the nationsbank  na prime rate and y the federal funds rate plus 
plus a margin of between 
and  depending on the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the credit facility is subject to terms and conditions typical of facilities of such size and includes certain financial covenants 
the company intends to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities and may be in various stages of negotiation  due diligence and documentation of potential acquisitions at any time 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
the company expects to fund future acquisitions primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings  including borrowings under the credit facility  as well as issuance of additional equity or debt 
to the extent the company funds a significant portion of the consideration for future acquisitions with cash  it may have to increase the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility or obtain other sources of financing through the public or private sale of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure such financing if and when it is needed or on terms the company deems acceptable 
if the company is unable to secure acceptable financing  its acquisition program could be negatively affected 
capital expenditures for equipment and expansion of facilities are expected to be funded from cash flow from operations and supplemented as necessary by borrowings under the credit facility 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations the business travel industry is seasonal and the company s results have fluctuated because of these seasonal variations 
net revenues and net income for the company are generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters 
the company expects this seasonality to continue in the future 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also be subject to fluctuations as a result of changes in relationships with certain travel suppliers  changes in the mix of services offered by the company  extreme weather conditions or other factors affecting travel 
unexpected variations in quarterly results could also adversely affect the price of the company s common stock  which in turn could limit the ability of the company to make acquisitions 
as the company continues to complete acquisitions  it may become subject to additional seasonal influences 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in the prices paid by the company for the products it sells  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies acquired may differ substantially from those of the company  which could contribute to the further fluctuation in its quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that the company may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements on june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas  as subsequently amended  is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  january  for the company 
fas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are to be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
the company believes that  due to its limited use of derivative instruments  the adoption of fas will not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
risk factors significant indebtedness and interest payment obligations navigant is significantly leveraged 
at december   navigant had million of consolidated outstanding debt and its total consolidated debt  as a percentage of capitalization  was 
navigant may also need to incur additional debt in the future to complete acquisitions or capital projects or for working capital even though its credit facility imposes some limits on its ability to do so 
navigant s high level of indebtedness could have important consequences to its stockholders  which include the following 
its ability to obtain additional financing to fund its business strategy  debt service requirements  capital expenditures  working capital or other purposes may be impaired  
its ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of its business will be limited because navigant must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to pay interest and principal on its debt  
certain of its borrowings bear interest at variable rates  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates  
it may not be able to compete with others who are not as highly leveraged  and 
its significant leverage may limit its flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions  changes in its industry and economic downturns 
navigant s ability to pay interest on its debt obligations will depend upon its future operating performance and its ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond navigant s control  will affect its ability to make these payments 
if in the future navigant cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to meet its obligations  navigant will need to refinance  obtain additional financing or sell assets 
navigant cannot assure its stockholders that its business will generate cash flow  or that it will be able to obtain funding  sufficient to satisfy its debt service requirements 
restrictions imposed by terms of indebtedness the covenants in navigant s existing debt agreements  including the credit facility and any future financing agreements may adversely affect its ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
these covenants limit or restrict navigant s ability to 
incur additional debt or prepay or modify any additional debt that may be incurred  
make certain acquisitions or investments  
pay dividends and make distributions  
repurchase its securities  
create liens  
transfer or sell assets  
enter into transactions with affiliates  
issue or sell stock of subsidiaries  
merge or consolidate  or 
materially change the nature of its business 
in addition  navigant s credit facility also requires it to comply with certain financial ratios 
navigant s ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond its control 
if navigant breaches any of these covenants in its credit facility  or if navigant is unable to comply with the required financial ratios  it may be in default under its credit facility 
a significant portion of navigant s indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable 
navigant is not certain whether it would have  or be able to obtain  sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments 
compliance with the covenants is also a condition to revolver borrowings under the credit facility on which navigant relies to fund its liquidity 
holding company structure navigant is a holding company 
navigant s subsidiaries conduct substantially all of its consolidated operations and own substantially all of its consolidated assets 
consequently  navigant s cash flow and its ability to meet its debt service obligations depends upon the cash flow of its subsidiaries  the payment of funds by its subsidiaries to navigant in the form of loans  dividends or otherwise 
navigant s subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to navigant for payment on debt or otherwise 
in addition  their ability to make any payments will depend on their earnings  the terms of their indebtedness  business and tax considerations and legal restrictions 
risks related to revenue historically  corporate travel management companies were largely dependent for their air travel ticketing revenues on the point of sale percentage commissions paid by airlines for each ticket issued 
since  most airlines have substantially reduced the amount of commissions paid to travel agents for booking domestic and international flights 
the airlines have both capped the total commissions paid per ticket and reduced the commission rates per ticket payable to travel agents and may further reduce commissions in the future 
further reductions in commissions may reduce navigant s revenue 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of navigant introduction sources of revenue in item there can be no assurance that the airlines will not further reduce commissions 
navigant has responded to the reductions in the commissions paid by airlines by entering into management contracts and service fee arrangements with many of its corporate clients 
although the terms of its management contracts vary depending on the type of services provided and by client  navigant typically deducts a pre negotiated management fee  its direct operating expenses and its indirect overhead costs from commissions collected for travel arrangements made on behalf of the client 
if the commissions do not exceed the amounts deducted  the client pays the difference to navigant 
if the commissions exceed the amounts deducted  navigant typically pays the excess to the client 
in addition  navigant typically charges a service fee for each ticket and other transactions to clients who do not have a management contract with navigant 
in the future navigant may not be able to maintain or continue to negotiate management contracts or continue to receive current levels of fees from those contracts  and also may not be able to charge service fees or maintain the level of such service fees 
navigant also derives part of its revenues from incentive override commissions paid by the major airlines 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction sources of revenue in item if  during any period  navigant fails to meet incentive levels  revenues could decrease 
in addition  the airlines may reduce or terminate incentive override commissions and navigant may not be able to extend its current incentive override commission arrangements or enter into new arrangements that are as favorable as its current arrangements 
substantial competition and industry consolidation  new methods of distribution the corporate travel management industry is extremely competitive 
navigant competes primarily with other corporate travel management companies 
some of navigant s competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition and financial resources than navigant 
competition within the corporate travel management industry is increasing as the industry undergoes a period of consolidation 
certain of navigant s competitors are expanding their size and financial resources through consolidation 
some travel management companies may have relationships with certain travel suppliers which give them access to favorable availability of products including airplane seats and hotel rooms or more competitive pricing than that offered by navigant 
furthermore  some corporate travel management companies have a strong presence in particular geographic areas which may make it difficult for navigant to attract customers in those areas 
as a result of competitive pressures  navigant may suffer a loss of clients  and its revenues or margins may decline 
navigant also competes with travel suppliers  including airlines  hotels and rental car companies 
innovations in technology  such as the internet and computer on line services  have increased the ability of travel suppliers to distribute their travel products and services directly to consumers 
although corporate travel management companies and travel agencies remain the primary channel for travel distribution  businesses and consumers can now use the internet to access information about travel products and services and to purchase such products and services directly from the suppliers  thereby bypassing corporate travel management companies and travel agents 
navigant believes that no single internet based service presently provides access to the full range of information available to navigant and its agents 
an internet based travel service may  however  provide such access in the future 
in addition  although navigant believes the service  knowledge and skills of its employees and its incorporation of new  alternative distribution channels  position it to compete effectively in the changing industry  there can be no assurance that navigant will compete successfully or that the failure to compete successfully will not have a material adverse effect on navigant s financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on travel suppliers navigant is dependent upon travel suppliers for access to their products and services including airplane seats and hotel rooms 
certain travel suppliers offer navigant pricing that is preferential to published fares  enabling navigant to offer prices lower than would be generally available to travelers and other corporation travel management companies or travel agents 
travel suppliers can generally cancel or modify their agreements with navigant upon relatively short notice  leaving navigant subject to the loss of contracts  changes in its pricing agreements  commission schedules and incentive override commission arrangements  and more restricted access to travel suppliers products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on navigant s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon technology navigant s business is dependent upon a number of different information and telecommunications technologies 
in addition  navigant s ability to quote air travel ticket prices  make reservations and sell tickets is dependent upon its contractual right to use  and the performance of  computer reservation systems operated by sabre  galileo apollo  worldspan and amadeus 
navigant s business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if these technologies or systems fail  or if navigant s access to these systems is restricted 
risks associated with the corporate travel management industry  general economic conditions navigant s operating results generally depend upon factors affecting the corporate travel management industry 
navigant s revenues and earnings are especially sensitive to events that affect business air travel  and the level of car rentals and hotel reservations 
a number of factors  including recession or slower economic growth  rising travel costs  extreme weather conditions and concerns about passenger safety  could result in a temporary or longer term overall decline in demand for business travel 
advances in technology and communications  such as videoconferencing and internet based teleconferencing  may also adversely impact travel patterns and travel demand 
navigant believes that price based competition will continue in the airline industry for the foreseeable future 
the continuation of such competition and the occurrence of any of the events described above could have a material adverse effect on navigant s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to integration of operations and acquisitions one of navigant s strategies is to increase operating margins by consolidating and integrating certain administrative functions common to all of its subsidiaries 
this integration will require substantial attention from senior management and may require future substantial capital expenditures 
the integration process may disrupt navigant s operations as well as those of its subsidiaries as its management s attention is diverted from other tasks  and as technological  practical or personnel issues arise 
there can be no assurance that the integration and consolidation will be completed  or that  if completed  navigant will recognize economic benefit 
currently  navigant and some of its subsidiaries operate on separate computer systems and navigant and most of its subsidiaries operate on separate telephone systems  several of which use different technologies 
although navigant has made substantial progress in consolidating its back room accounting  several other systems have not been consolidated 
navigant expects that it will eventually integrate these other systems  but it has not yet established a definitive timetable for integration of all of such systems or its definitive capital needs for the integration 
the contemplated integration of its systems may cause disruption to navigant s business and may not result in the intended cost efficiencies 
in addition  rapid changes in technologies may require capital expenditures to improve or upgrade client service 
risks related to navigant s acquisition strategy general 
one of navigant s strategies is to increase its revenues and the markets it serves through the acquisition of additional corporate travel companies 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors risk of rapid growth  limited history as a stand alone company in item navigant may not be able to make acquisitions at the pace it desires or on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  the consolidation of the travel management industry has reduced the number of companies available for sale  which could lead to higher prices being paid for the acquisition of the remaining travel management companies 
the companies navigant has acquired  or which navigant may acquire in the future  may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify navigant s investment in them 
navigant s acquisitions of companies outside the united states may subject it to certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally 
these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates  new and different legal and regulatory requirements and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 
integration 
integration of operations of the companies navigant acquired or may acquire in the future may also involve a number of special risks  which may have adverse short term effects on navigant s operating results 
these may be caused by 
severance payments to employees of acquired companies  
restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions  and 
other expenses associated with a change in control 
integration of acquire companies may also result in 
diversion of management s attention  
difficulties with retention  
the need to hire and train key employees  
risks associated with unanticipated problems or legal liabilities  and 
amortization of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill 
navigant conducts due diligence and generally requires representations  warranties and indemnifications from the former owners of acquired companies 
navigant cannot be certain  however  that such owners will have accurately represented the financial and operating conditions of their companies 
if an acquired company s financial or operating results were misrepresented  the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on navigant s results of operations and financial condition 
financing 
navigant currently intends to finance its future acquisitions by using cash  borrowed funds  shares of its common stock or a combination thereof 
if navigant s common stock does not maintain a sufficient market value  if its price is highly volatile  or if  for other reasons  potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept navigant s common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses  navigant may then be required to use more of its cash resources or more borrowed funds in order to maintain its acquisition program 
navigant s ability to use shares of its common stock to make acquisitions may also be limited by section e of the internal revenue code 
that section provides that a company that distributes shares of a subsidiary in a spin off that is otherwise tax free will incur us federal income tax liability if or more  by vote or value  of the capital stock of either the company making the distribution or the spin off subsidiary is acquired pursuant to a plan or series of related transactions that includes the spin off 
acquisitions made by navigant within two years before or after the distribution by us office products of navigant s common stock in june may be deemed part of such a plan or series of related transactions 
if navigant is unable to use common stock for acquisitions and navigant does not have sufficient cash resources  its growth could be limited unless navigant is able to obtain additional capital through debt or other financing 
navigant may not be able to obtain additional capital if and when needed on terms navigant deems acceptable 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors restrictions imposed by terms of indebtedness in item accounting 
generally accepted accounting principles require that an entity be autonomous for a period of two years before it is eligible to complete business combinations under the pooling of interests method 
navigant has been and will be unable to satisfy this criterion for a period of two years following the distribution of its common stock by us office products until approximately june 
therefore  any business combination completed by navigant during such period will be accounted for under the purchase method  resulting in the recording of goodwill 
the amortization of the goodwill has and will reduce navigant s reported net income below that which would have been reported if it had used the pooling of interests method 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors material amount of goodwill in item existing stockholders may suffer dilution if navigant uses navigant common stock as consideration for future acquisitions 
moreover  the issuance of additional shares of navigant common stock may negatively impact earnings per share and the market price of navigant common stock 
additionally  the financial accounting standards board is currently considering proposed guidance that could eliminate the pooling of interest method and could shorten the amortization period for goodwill from the current maximum of years to years 
this proposed guidance  if adopted  may negatively impact earnings per share and the market price of navigant common stock 
reliance on key personnel navigant s operations depend on the continued efforts of edward s 
adams  its chairman and chief executive officer  c 
thomas nulty  its president and chief operating officer  robert c 
griffith  its chief financial officer and treasurer  its other executive officers and the senior management of its subsidiaries 
furthermore  navigant s operations will likely depend on the senior management of the companies that may be acquired in the future 
if any of these people become unable to continue in his or her present role  or if navigant is unable to attract and retain other skilled employees  its business could be adversely affected 
material amount of goodwill as of december   approximately million  or  of navigant s total assets and of navigant s stockholders equity represent intangible assets  the significant majority of which is goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
navigant amortizes goodwill on a straight line method over a period of years with the amount amortized in a particular period constituting a non cash expense that reduces its net income 
amortization of goodwill resulting from certain past acquisitions  and additional goodwill recorded in certain future acquisitions may not be deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  navigant will be required to periodically evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by reviewing the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from the operations of the acquired companies and comparing such cash flows to the carrying value of the associated goodwill 
if navigant determines that goodwill has become impaired in later years  earnings in such years will be significantly adversely affected 
a reduction in net income resulting from the amortization or write down of goodwill would currently affect financial results and could have a material and adverse impact upon the market price of navigant common stock 
navigant believes that anticipated cash flows associated with intangible assets recognized in the purchased companies  the purchased companies and the purchased companies will continue over the period during which the associated goodwill will be amortized  and there presently is no persuasive evidence that any material portion will dissipate during such period
