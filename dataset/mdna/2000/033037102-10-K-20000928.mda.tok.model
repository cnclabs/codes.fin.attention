the information contained below may be subject to risk factors 
we urge you to review carefully the section risk factors in this annual report form k for a more complete discussion of the risks associated with an investment in our securities 
see special note on forward looking statements and risk factors above under item overview we are a diversified  global gaming company operating principally through three business segments gaming machines  which includes the design  development and distribution of proprietary gaming machines 
gaming operations  which includes the operations of two casinos in colorado  a racetrack and casino in new mexico  slot machine routes in nevada and montana  and a interest in the development contract and seven year management contract to develop and manage a california native american casino that we expect to open in march gaming systems  which includes the design  manufacture and sale of video gaming machines and central control systems and the design  manufacture  sale  installation and operation of on line lottery systems and computerized pari mutuel wagering systems 
on june   we completed our acquisition of powerhouse technologies  inc for approximately million plus powerhouse net debt of million 
we funded the powerhouse acquisition through a combination of cash and borrowing under our million senior credit facility 
we accounted for the powerhouse acquisition using the purchase method of accounting 
because the closing of the powerhouse acquisition occurred virtually concurrently with the end of our fiscal year  our financial statements for the year ended june  do not include any results of operations or cash flows for powerhouse  except for a non recurring charge for acquired in process research and development that was recorded in fiscal in september  we announced the signing of development and management agreements with the pala band of mission indians for the design  construction  financing  operation and management of pala  a casino and entertainment facility on the federally recognized pala reservation in northern san diego county  california 
the management agreement is for a period of seven years commencing on the opening date of the casino facility  which we expect to be in the spring of the pala tribe secured a million credit facility through a loan agreement and ancillary financial documents finalized on june  as a condition to the financing  we agreed to guarantee the full payment and performance of the obligations of the pala tribe under the loan agreement 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we restructured the operations of our vlc subsidiary 
as a result  we now manage and account for the vlc subsidiary as two separate business units  vlc government and vlc casino 
vlc government focuses on sales of central systems and video lottery gaming machines to governmental jurisdictions under our gaming systems segment 
vlc casino  which was formerly based in bozeman  montana  and is now based in las vegas  focuses on the development and sales of gaming machines to casinos under our gaming machines segment 
in conjunction with this restructuring  we have changed our financial reporting segments from four segments to the three segments outlined above 
on september   we announced the execution of a definitive agreement with our chairman  stanley fulton  and members of his family and their affiliates to acquire approximately million shares of our common stock for a purchase price of per share 
the fulton family members and their affiliates will retain ownership of approximately  shares after the transaction 
stanley fulton  his son  michael fulton  and his daughter  elizabeth jones have agreed to resign their positions on our board of directors upon completion of the transaction 
the purchase consideration for the shares comprises million in cash and million principal amount of promissory notes that stanley fulton will receive for a portion of the shares he is selling 
in conjunction with the stock purchase transaction with the fulton family  we have entered into an agreement with stanley fulton to sell him substantially all of the assets relating to our sunland park racetrack casino  located in new mexico  and our interest in a massachusetts horse racing facility 
mr 
fulton has agreed to pay million for these assets by canceling our obligations under the promissory notes 
we expect to complete the sale of these racetrack assets to mr 
fulton during the first quarter of fiscal  subject to regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other conditions 
after the sale of these assets  we will retain the right to manage gaming operations at the massachusetts racetrack if casino gaming is legalized in massachusetts 
the discussion of our gaming operations segment in this section includes sunland park racetrack casino 
the demand for our gaming machines currently exceeds our production capacity 
the anchor igt joint venture currently has a production backlog of approximately  video wheel of fortune tm games and approximately  conversion games 
the anchor igt joint venture s newest offering  the i dream of jeannie tm gaming machine  currently have committed orders for approximately machines 
the following tables and discussion present pro forma figures for as if the powerhouse acquisition occurred on july  and exclude non recurring items such as charges for acquired in process research and development and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
prior to the powerhouse acquisition in june  we had no gaming systems business 
actual fiscal year actual fiscal year revenues costs of revenues revenues costs of revenues in thousands gaming machines     gaming operations     gaming systems total     pro forma fiscal year actual fiscal year revenues costs of revenues revenues costs of revenues in thousands gaming machines     gaming operations     gaming systems     total     fiscal year ended june  actual actual pro forma actual sources of revenues gaming machines gaming operations gaming systems total gross margin gaming machines gaming operations gaming systems total consolidated gross margin fiscal year compared to fiscal year gaming machines gaming machines accounted for and of total revenues during the years ended june  and  respectively 
on a pro forma basis this segment accounted for of total revenues during the year ended june  revenues from gaming machines were million for the year ended june   an increase of million or from million for the year ended june  the increase in segment revenues can be primarily attributed to the increased equity earnings in the anchor igt joint venture  which  for accounting purposes  are recorded net of expense 
the increase is also due to the addition of vlc casino revenues of approximately million related to the powerhouse acquisition and was offset by net decreases in revenues from our non joint venture  or stand alone  proprietary games 
revenues from the anchor igt joint venture increased million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal at june   there were approximately  games  primarily wheel of fortune tm  operating within the anchor igt joint venture  compared to approximately  games at june  revenues from stand alone proprietary games decreased million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal during the year ended june   our installed base of stand alone proprietary games  without regard to our anchor igt joint venture games  increased from the year ended june  however  a decrease in the average net win per unit for the installed base of stand alone proprietary games during the same period resulted in an overall decline in stand alone revenues 
on a pro forma basis  revenues from gaming machines for the year ended june   increased million or from the pro forma revenues of million for the year ended june  this increase is primarily a result of the increase in revenues from the anchor igt joint venture  as discussed above  offset by decreased machine sales at vlc casino and stand alone proprietary game revenues 
revenues from vlc casino decreased million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in vlc casino machine sales results from declines in machine sales to governmental jurisdictions  as we lessen our focus on sales to the casino gaming market in favor of recurring revenue arrangements 
costs of gaming machines were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for the historical fiscal year the addition of vlc casino in the powerhouse acquisition accounted for an increase in historical costs by contributing approximately million to costs of gaming machines during fiscal year this increase was offset by a lower level of write downs related to gaming machines within our stand alone proprietary games operations  and to a lesser extent  by decreases in royalty expenses as a result of decreased revenues from our stand alone games and an overall decrease in the royalty expense rate 
gaming machines segment gross margin increased to during fiscal year from during fiscal year within the segment  in fiscal  gross margins were for the anchor igt joint venture due to its accounting treatment under the equity method  for the stand alone proprietary games division and for vlc casino 
in fiscal gross margins were for the anchor igt joint venture  for stand alone proprietary games and for vlc casino 
on a pro forma basis  gaming machines segment costs decreased million or from million in due to the decreased historical proprietary games costs and due to decreases in costs related to decreased revenues from vlc casino 
gaming machines segment gross margin increased to during the year ended june  from during the pro forma year ended june  this is due primarily to the increase in equity earnings and the decrease in machine sales from vlc casino  which has achieved lower margins historically when compared to the margins achieved in the proprietary games operations  including the anchor igt joint venture 
changes in interest rates could have an effect on the earnings of the anchor igt joint venture 
since jackpot expense is a function of the present value of future jackpot payments  future changes in the interest rate environment will affect the profitability of the anchor igt joint venture 
specifically  decreases in interest rates will increase the then current period s jackpot expense of the anchor igt joint venture while future increases in interest rates will decrease the then current period s jackpot expense of the anchor igt joint venture 
gaming operations gaming operations accounted for and of total revenues during the years ended june  and  respectively 
on a pro forma basis  this segment accounted for of total revenues during the year ended june  total revenues from the gaming operations segment were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for historical year the additions of slot machine operations at sunland park racetrack casino and the montana route operation  which occurred due to the powerhouse acquisition  accounted for the increase in historical revenues by contributing approximately million to revenues in fiscal year the commencement of casino operations in february at sunland park contributed million of revenues for this period 
in addition  our nevada route operation increased by approximately million 
this increase was offset by decreased revenues at our colorado casinos of approximately million as a result of the increased competition in these markets 
on a pro forma basis  revenues from gaming operations for the year ended june  increased million or from pro forma revenues for the year ended june  this increase is primarily due to the commencement of slot machine operations at sunland park  as discussed above  which contributed increased revenues of million 
costs of gaming operations revenue were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million in fiscal year gaming operations gross margin decreased to during fiscal year from during fiscal year the addition of sunland park and the montana route operation contributed approximately million to costs of gaming operations during the fiscal year the remaining increase is due primarily to increased costs of approximately million at our colorado casinos resulting from increased competition  and to a lesser extent  increased costs of approximately million in the nevada route operation as a result of increased revenues 
on a pro forma basis  costs of gaming operations increased million or during the year ended june  versus pro forma costs of million for the year ended june  this increase is due primarily to the commencement of casino operations at sunland park in february gaming operations gross margin decreased to during the year ended june  from during the pro forma year ended june  this is due primarily to the commencement of casino operations at the sunland park and the growth in nevada route operation costs  both of which have lower margins than the colorado casino operations that historically accounted for a greater percentage of gaming operations revenue 
the decrease in gross margin is also the result of decreased margins at our colorado casinos  which are the result of increased competition 
gaming systems gaming systems accounted for of total revenues during the year ended june  we had no gaming systems business prior to the powerhouse acquisition 
on a pro forma basis this segment accounted for of total revenues during the year ended june  revenues from gaming systems were million for the year ended june   an increase of million or from pro forma revenues of million for the year ended june  the increase over pro forma revenues is primarily due to increases in revenues from one time equipment sales of approximately million in china  switzerland and the west indies during the year ended june   as well as domestic lottery revenue increases 
during the year ended june   we started and continued work on our switzerland contract implementation  and completed the installation of a lottery system in china and the west indies 
domestically  increased revenues resulted from the commencement of operations under our on line lottery contract with the hoosier lottery in indiana and strong results in florida 
the resulting increase in revenue was partially offset by the loss of the montana lottery contract  which was terminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal costs of gaming systems were million during the year ended june   an increase of million or on a pro forma basis from the pro forma costs for the year ended june   due primarily to increased revenues 
the gross margin remained constant at in fiscal and the pro forma year 
other costs selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year during the year ended june   businesses acquired in the powerhouse acquisition constituted million  or  of sg a expenses 
the remaining increase was due primarily to additional payroll and promotional costs at our colorado central station casino 
on a pro forma basis  sg a expenses for the year ended june  increased million or over the pro forma year ended june   due primarily to the historical increase noted above as well as the commencement of casino operations at sunland park  and to a lesser extent  increased labor costs and professional fees in our gaming systems segment 
research and development r d expenses were million for fiscal year  an increase of million from million for fiscal year during the year ended june   businesses acquired in the powerhouse acquisition contributed million in r d expenses 
to a lesser extent  the increase reflects higher r d expenses in our proprietary games business within our gaming machines segment 
the remaining increase resulted primarily from a one time settlement received from the ontario provincial government in the prior year  which reduced r d expense for fiscal the province of ontario has mandated that the terms of the settlement be held in confidence 
on a pro forma basis  r d expenses for the year ended june  increased million or from million for the pro forma year ended june   resulting from increased r d expenses of the acquired operations within the gaming machines operations  as well as the historical increase noted above 
in addition to the r d expenses reflected on our financial statements  r d costs related to the anchor igt joint venture are recorded within the anchor igt joint venture and are not included in the amounts disclosed as r d in our financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a plan  which was not contemplated at the time of the acquisition  to restructure our vlc subsidiary 
impairment and restructuring charges of million were incurred in fiscal in connection with the restructuring of vlc 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
acquired in process research and development of million in fiscal year was incurred in connection with the powerhouse acquisition 
this non recurring expense represents the value of the research and development projects that were in various stages of completion at the date of the acquisition 
there was no income tax benefit as a result of this expense  thereby increasing our effective tax rate for fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for historical fiscal year during the year ended june   businesses acquired from powerhouse contributed million in depreciation and amortization expense 
the remaining historical increase resulted from increased depreciation expense incurred in the gaming machine operations 
on a pro forma basis  depreciation and amortization for the year ended june  increased million or from the pro forma year ended june   due primarily to increased depreciation and amortization expense incurred at awi and sunland park 
depreciation increased at awi primarily due to the capital expenditures associated with fiscal domestic contract implementations 
the sunland park increase related to the commencement of gaming operations in february income from operations 
as a result of the factors discussed above  income from operations was million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for historical fiscal year and or on a pro forma basis from the year ended june  excluding the million charge for acquired in process research and development  income from operations for fiscal year would have been million 
as a percentage of total revenues  income from operations remained constant at during fiscal year and fiscal year other income expense 
interest income was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million or from million for historical fiscal year ended the decrease is due to decreased cash balances for investment as a result of spending for the powerhouse acquisition 
interest expense of million for fiscal year  an increase of million from historical fiscal year  is the result of borrowings associated with the powerhouse acquisition 
as a result of the factors discussed above  net other expense was million for fiscal year compared to net other income of million for fiscal year net income and earnings per share

the increase in revenues was also due to increased revenues from our proprietary games cashball tm and safebuster tm 
these increases were offset to some extent by decreased revenues generated from the wheel of gold tm  totem pole tm and clear winner tm games as well as decreased revenues from the sale of tokens for the proprietary game silver strike tm 
at june  there were approximately  games  primarily wheel of fortune tm  operating within the anchor igt joint venture  compared to approximately  games at june  costs of gaming machine revenues were million for the fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for the fiscal year the increase in the cost of proprietary games revenues was due primarily to increased machine parts used in our operations outside the anchor igt joint venture  increased costs of production and service payroll and shipping and handling 
during fiscal year  we engaged in extensive improvements and modifications to existing proprietary games in order to maintain performance levels of the games 
the costs associated with the upgrades and regular maintenance of games in operation are expensed as incurred

gaming operations gaming operations accounted for and of total revenues during the year ended june  and  respectively 
total revenues from gaming operations were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a million increase in route revenues coupled with increased slot revenues at the colorado central station casino and  to a lesser extent  increased slot revenues at the colorado grande casino 
the increase in route revenues was due to the increased number of machines on route and increased performance of the machines on the route due to machine mix enhancements 
machines on route increased by machines or to at june  from machines at june  average machines on route during fiscal increased or to from average machines in fiscal increases in route revenues were realized from both participation locations and space lease locations 
the year over year increase in casino slot revenues was realized almost entirely during the first six months of fiscal year with the second six months of fiscal year resulting in flat year over year comparisons 
costs of gaming operations revenue were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year gaming operations gross margin decreased to during fiscal year from during fiscal year we incurred increased marketing and personnel related costs in order to sustain year over year revenue levels within our colorado casino operations 
other costs sg a expenses were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained constant at during fiscal year and fiscal year the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to increased tax and licensing costs within our gaming machines segment  increased costs and expenses for advertising in our gaming operations segment and increased administrative payroll at the corporate level 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of  or from million for fiscal year the decrease is due to reduced expenses in fiscal year for development at the corporate level  offset to some extent by increases in the proprietary games business within the gaming machines segment 
the decrease in corporate development resulted primarily from reduced development costs related to the canadian charity based casino initiative that was canceled by the ontario provincial government on june  in addition to the research and development expenses reflected on our financial statements  research and development costs related to the anchor igt joint venture are accounted for on the books of the anchor igt joint venture and are not included in the amounts disclosed as research and development in our financial statements 
acquired in process research and development of million in fiscal year was incurred in connection with the powerhouse acquisition 
this non recurring expense represents the value of the research and development projects that were in various stages of completion at the date of the acquisition 
there was no income tax benefit as a result of this expense  thereby increasing our effective tax rate for fiscal depreciation and amortization expense was million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense incurred in our proprietary games operations and  to a lesser extent  at our colorado central station casino and in our route operations due to the use of shortened lives for all gaming machines 
income from operations 
as a result of the factors discussed above  income from operations was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million or from million for fiscal year excluding the million charge for acquired in process research and development  income from operations for fiscal year would have been million  a decrease of only million or from fiscal year as a percentage of total revenues  income from operations decreased to during fiscal year from during fiscal year other income expense 
interest income was million for fiscal year  an increase of  or from million for fiscal year ended the increase was due to increased short term investments resulting from higher average cash balances during the year

as a result of the factors discussed above  net income was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million or from million for fiscal year diluted earnings per share were for fiscal year  a decrease of per share from the diluted earnings per share for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
at june   we maintained million in cash and equivalents  million in working capital  and million available under a revolving credit facility  compared with cash and equivalents at june  of million  working capital of million  and million available under an unsecured revolving credit facility 
to fund the acquisition of powerhouse technologies  inc  we borrowed million on a new million senior unsecured reducing revolving credit facility 
amounts drawn on the senior credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus an applicable margin or prime rate plus an applicable margin  at our option 
all borrowings under the senior credit facility are due on june  we have agreed to maintain certain financial and non financial covenants customary with lending arrangements of this type 
we believe we are in compliance with applicable covenants at june  we believe that cash provided by operations will remain a significant source of cash flows  and anticipate that both operations and draws on our senior credit facility will provide the capital needed for continued business growth 
during fiscal year  operating activities provided million in cash flows on million in net income  compared with million in cash flows on million in net income during fiscal year net income in fiscal year included non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization of approximately million compared with non cash expenses in fiscal year of approximately million 
the significant non cash expenses in were approximately million of depreciation and amortization 
also in fiscal  we recognized earnings in the anchor igt joint venture that were approximately million greater than cash distributions to us 
investing activities and capital expenditures 
in fiscal year  we had cash outflows for investing activities of million primarily related to the purchase and installation of assets for domestic and international lottery jurisdictions 
we selectively pursue opportunities to win additional and retain existing on line wagering contracts 
if successful in obtaining new state lottery contracts  and depending on the size of the jurisdictions served  we may be required to secure additional funding for the related capital expenditures 
in addition  during fiscal we contributed million to the anchor igt joint venture and million to anchor partners  llc and ourway realty  llc 
in fiscal year  we had cash outflows for investing activities of million primarily related to the acquisition of powerhouse 
our capital expenditure budget for fiscal is estimated to be between and million 
we believe that cash flows from operations  borrowings under our senior credit facility  and existing cash balances will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated uses of capital during fiscal year we are  however  continually evaluating our financing needs 
if more attractive financing alternatives or expansion  development or acquisition opportunities become available to us  we may amend our financing plans assuming such financing would be permitted under our debt agreements 
substantial funds are required for the operation of our gaming systems segment and may also be required for other future projects 
the source of funds required to meet our working capital needs including maintenance capital expenditures is expected to be cash flow from operations and availability under our senior credit facility 
the source of funds for our future projects may come from cash flow from operations and availability under our senior credit facility  additional debt or equity offerings  joint venture partners or other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on favorable terms 
the gaming systems segment operates in a capital intensive industry  in which wagering terminals  computer systems and applications and communications software must be installed throughout a jurisdiction  often beginning up to one year before revenues are earned on the long term contract 
when a new jurisdiction is added to our customer base  capital required to obtain and install hardware and software can be significant 
generally  initial contract terms are from five to nine years  often with one or more one to three year extension options 
upon expiration of a contract and its extensions  the jurisdiction typically requires vendors to rebid their services and  if successful  replace existing equipment with new terminals 
an incumbent vendor may have some benefit due to the communications infrastructure already in place  but most often  a significant portion of the initial capital expenditures must be replaced upon the reawarding of a lottery contract 
pala guarantee 
under the terms of our development and management agreements with the pala band of mission indians  which we executed in september  we agreed to assist the pala tribe in obtaining financing for the construction and operation of pala and to advance funds during the design and development stages 
the pala tribe secured a million credit facility through a loan agreement and ancillary financial documents finalized on june  as a condition to receiving financing  we agreed to guarantee the full payment and performance of the obligations of the pala tribe under the loan agreement 
we executed a guarantee that remains in effect until the earlier of either repayment in full of all guaranteed financial obligations under the loan agreement or delivery to lenders of a leasehold mortgage on pala if it has been in operation for at least twelve months and specified financial and leverage thresholds have been met 
the guarantee will also be released days following the date on which we or any of our affiliates cease to be the manager of pala  unless lenders have demanded payment of outstanding obligations from the pala tribe during such period 
in addition  we have agreed to fund pala project cost overruns up to a total amount of million 
anchor pala development llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  will receive a development fee based on the actual total project costs and a project fee based on net gaming and non gaming pala revenues 
as additional consideration for all costs  risks  restrictions and expenses associated with providing the guarantee  we will receive fees based primarily on a percentage of the outstanding loan balance 
liquidated damages under on line lottery contracts 
our lottery contracts typically permit termination of the contract by the lottery authority at any time for our failure to perform or for other specified reasons and generally contain demanding implementation schedules and performance schedules 
failure to perform under such contracts may result in substantial monetary liquidated damages  as well as contract termination 
many of our lottery contracts also permit the lottery authority to terminate the contract at will and do not specify the compensation  if any  to which we would be entitled should such termination occur 
some of our united states lottery contracts have contained provisions for up to million a day in liquidated damages for late system start up and have provided for up to  per minute or more in penalties for system downtime in excess of a stipulated grace period  and some of our international customers similarly reserve the right to assess monetary damages in the event of contract termination or breach 
although such liquidated damages provisions are customary in the lottery industry and the actual liquidated damages imposed are generally subject to negotiation  such provisions in our lottery contracts present an ongoing potential for substantial expense 
our lottery contracts generally require us to post a performance bond  which in some cases may be substantial  securing our performance under such contracts 
we do not believe that we have any exposure relative to liquidated damages at june  stock repurchase program 
during fiscal year  we spent million to repurchase  shares of our common stock pursuant to a board authorized stock repurchase program 
in april  the board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to  shares of common stock 
the board of directors authorized additional repurchases of up to  shares in december  shares in october  and  shares in march from the initial authorization of the program through june   we have repurchased  shares of common stock at a cost of million 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares at a cost of million  and during fiscal  we repurchased  shares at a cost of million 
at june   a balance of  authorized shares remained under the stock repurchase program 
under our senior credit facility  we may repurchase during any fiscal year of our prior fiscal year net income  plus an additional one time million during the term of the facility 
working capital requirements 
in addition to cash requirements needed for the purchase and construction of capital equipment  we require working capital to finance customer receivables and inventory levels 
at june   notes receivable from customers totaled million  primarily resulting from gaming machine sales 
because we expect the continued growth of the gaming machines segment and intend to continue financing sales when advantageous to us  notes receivable balances may increase 
financing gaming machine sales over short periods is common in the gaming machine sales industry  and most of our customer notes range from one to two years  with interest rates of up to 
some international and domestic receivables have repayment periods of up to nine years 
we continually seek opportunities to expand our gaming oriented businesses in new and existing gaming jurisdictions 
if successful in pursuing another opportunity in any gaming oriented business and depending on the amount of funding required  we may be required to obtain additional financing 
recently issued accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued in june this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires that all derivatives be marked to market on an ongoing basis 
this applies whether the derivatives are stand alone documents  such as forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps  or embedded derivatives  such as call options contained in convertible debt instruments 
these market value adjustments are to be included either in the income statement or stockholders equity  depending on the intended use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
we expect to adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
based on analysis to date  we believe that our use of derivative instruments is limited and have identified one item  an interest rate swap arrangement for a notional amount of million that we entered into in fiscal we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
 including the cumulative effect adjustment and the ongoing mark to market adjustments resulting from the change in value of the interest rate swap arrangement  will have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
in june  the securities and exchange commission staff amended sab to provide registrants with additional time to implement sab we will be required to adopt sab by the fourth quarter of fiscal we have not completed our determination of the effect of the adoption of sab on our consolidated financial position or results of operation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our floating rate debt 
the principal balance of floating rate debt at june   was million 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments 
in fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of million 
the agreement calls for us to swap our variable libor rate at june  for a fixed libor rate of 
the variable libor rate readjusts each quarter  and the agreement is cancelable by the bank after one year 
the swap agreement terminates in october the fair value of the swap asset at june  is approximately million based on the present value of future cash inflows expected based on the libor rate at june  the profitability of our investment in the anchor igt joint venture is also affected by changes in interest rates 
the anchor igt joint venture records expenses for future jackpots based on current rates for government securities and bank debt instruments of varying maturities  which are used to fund liabilities to winners 
as interest rates decline  our equity in the earnings of the anchor igt joint venture also decline 
we do not have any cash or cash equivalents at june  that are subject to market risk based on changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
as of june   we had accounts and notes receivable denominated in canadian currency of million of total receivables and  of total receivables denominated in australian currency 
all foreign receivables are expected to be collected within months 
we do not currently hedge against foreign currency exposure
