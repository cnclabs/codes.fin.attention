item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company we are the holding company for rcre  our wholly owned subsidiary which is domiciled in nebraska 
we were incorporated in march and commenced operations in september upon completion of our initial public offering 
we received aggregate net proceeds from the offering of approximately million  of which million was contributed to the capital of rcre 
on november   rcre was licensed under the insurance laws of the state of nebraska and is currently licensed or accredited as a reinsurer in states 
as of december   the statutory surplus of rcre was approximately million 
in july  rcre capitalized its wholly owned subsidiary  cross river  with million 
cross river received its nebraska insurance license in october  and is currently authorized to write insurance on an excess and surplus lines basis in additional states 
folksamerica transaction as of january   we entered into an agreement with folksamerica reinsurance company and folksamerica holding company collectively  folksamerica pursuant to which folksamerica reinsurance company will assume rcre s liabilities under the reinsurance agreements transferred in the asset sale and rcre will transfer to folksamerica reinsurance company assets in an aggregate amount that is  in book value  equal to the book value of the liabilities assumed 
in consideration for the transfer of rcre s book of business  folksamerica will pay million in cash at the closing  subject to adjustment under the circumstances set forth in the asset purchase agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  we will place million in escrow for a period of five years 
these funds will be primarily used to reimburse folksamerica to the extent that the loss reserves which were million at december  relating to business produced on behalf of rcre by a certain managing underwriting agency are deficient as measured at the end of such five year period 
to the extent that such loss reserves are redundant  all of the escrowed funds will be returned to us and folksamerica will pay us an amount equal to such redundancy 
we will be responsible for certain tax costs incurred by folksamerica in the transaction  as well as our own transaction and severance costs  and certain reinsurance costs incurred for the benefit of folksamerica 
an additional amount of up to million may be placed in escrow for a period of five years to the extent that rcre s reserves at closing are less by at least a specified amount than those estimated by its independent actuaries 
in connection with either escrow arrangement  we will record a loss in an amount equal to any probable deficiency in the related reserve that may become known during or at the end of the five year period 
the sale of our reinsurance business to folksamerica is contingent on approval by our stockholders  obtaining applicable regulatory approvals  the retention of a key employee  obtaining certain third party consents  the absence of a material adverse change in rcre s business  and other customary closing conditions 
marsh mclennan risk capital holdings  ltd 
and the trident partnership  lp  which collectively represent approximately of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock after giving effect to the repurchase of  shares on march  from xl capital  which is discussed below  have agreed to vote in favor of the asset sale 
please see the sections of our special meeting proxy statement entitled questions and answers about the asset sale  risk factors  the asset sale  the asset purchase agreement and other transaction agreements  which are incorporated by reference 
in addition  we have filed the asset sale agreement  the voting agreements and other related agreements as exhibits to this annual report 
the above summary of the proposed transaction is qualified by these agreements  which are incorporated by reference 
please also refer to unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data 
the gaap book value of the assets and liabilities to be transferred to folksamerica recorded in the accompanying financial statements at december  are as follows in millions fixed maturities and short term investments premiums receivable reinsurance recoverable deferred policy acquisition costs deferred income tax asset other insurance assets total assets reserve for claims and claims expenses net unearned premium reserve reinsurance premiums payable other insurance liabilities total liabilities net book value of assets and liabilities to be transferred the actual gaap book value of the assets and liabilities transferred to folksamerica will be determined as of the closing date of the asset sale  and will differ from that set forth above 
at the closing of the asset sale  rcre and folksamerica will enter into a transfer and assumption agreement  under which folksamerica will assume rcre s rights and obligations under the reinsurance agreements being transferred in the asset sale 
following regulatory approval of these agreements  the reinsureds under such agreements that are in force will be notified that folksamerica has assumed rcre s obligations and that  unless the reinsureds object to the assumption  rcre will be released from its obligations to those reinsureds 
assuming that none of the reinsureds object to the assumption  the gross liabilities for such business will be removed from the accounts of rcre for statutory accounting and gaap accounting purposes 
rcre will continue to record gross liabilities in its accounts for reinsureds that object to the release of rcre from its obligations to such reinsureds 
in such instances  an offsetting accounts receivable amount from folksamerica would be recorded as an asset equal to such gross liabilities 
this would also result in a portion of any pre tax gain on the asset sale being deferred and amortized into income as gross liabilities are extinguished 
xl transaction on march   we repurchased from xl capital  then our single largest stockholder  all of the  shares of our common stock held by it 
under the terms of a stock repurchase agreement with xl capital  we paid per share of our common stock  or a total of million 
the per share repurchase price was determined as the lesser of of the average closing market price of our common stock during the trading days beginning on the third business day following public announcement of the stock repurchase and asset sale january   which was  and we paid xl capital the consideration for the repurchase with our interest in privately held larc holdings  ltd 
parent of latin american reinsurance company ltd  valued at million which was carried by us at million at december   and all of our interest in annuity and life re holdings  ltd  valued at per share and per warrant  or million in the aggregate which was carried by us at million at december  
xl capital paid us in cash the difference equal to million between our repurchase price and the value of our interests in larc holdings and annuity and life re 
the value per share of annuity and life re was determined by taking the average of the closing price of annuity and life re shares for the same period used in determining the repurchase price of our shares 
the value of the warrants was determined using a black scholes methodology 
we have filed the stock repurchase agreement and related voting and disposition agreement as exhibits to this annual report 
the above summary of the transaction is qualified by these agreements  which are incorporated by reference 
as a result of this transaction  stockholders equity  which was million at december   has been reduced by million and the number of outstanding voting shares  which was  at december   was  at march  rcre s statutory surplus  which was million at december   was also reduced by million for the distribution of the stock and warrants in both larc holdings  ltd 
and annuity and life re holdings  ltd  to us  based on their statutory carrying values at december  rcre distribution upon payment of a contemplated distribution from rcre to us that would occur after the completion of the asset sale  our assets would consist of fixed maturity and short term investments  publicly traded equity securities and privately held securities  and our remaining million investment commitment to trident ii  lp would remain in place 
we would also continue to own all of the outstanding capital stock of rcre and cross river  each with statutory surplus of approximately million or any greater amount the nebraska insurance department requires rcre to retain in the event there are any objections from reinsureds to the release of rcre from further liability pursuant to the transfer and assumption agreement 
see liquidity and capital resources below for a discussion of the regulatory issues relating to distributions by rcre 
future operations following the sale of our reinsurance business to folksamerica  our intended strategy is to pursue business combinations and ventures with operating businesses 
our success will depend almost entirely on the operations  financial condition and management of the companies with which we may merge or which we may acquire in whole or in part 
we have not yet identified specific business opportunities 
accordingly  the financial and operational risks that we may encounter in the future cannot be specified 
see the section of our special meeting proxy statement entitled risk factors risks relating to our business after the asset sale  which is incorporated by reference 
recent industry performance demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by underwriting results of primary property and casualty insurers and prevailing general economic and market conditions  all of which affect liability retention decisions of primary insurers and reinsurance premium rates 
the supply of reinsurance is directly related to prevailing prices and levels of surplus capacity  which  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being realized in the reinsurance industry 
the last three years have been difficult periods from both a market and earnings perspective for most insurance markets 
the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance segments have experienced an increasingly more difficult and highly competitive operating environment characterized by a soft rate structure and overcapitalization 
other factors that have contributed to the prevailing competitive conditions in the reinsurance industry in recent years include new entrants to the reinsurance market including certain specialized reinsurance operations and the presence of certain reinsurance companies which operate within tax advantaged jurisdictions eg  bermuda  cayman islands that benefit from higher after tax investment returns 
in addition  concerns with respect to the financial security of lloyd s that had adversely impacted the competitive position of that marketplace have apparently been overcome by actions taken at lloyd s over the last few years  thereby enhancing its competitive position 
the industry s profitability can also be affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments  including changes in the propensity of courts to grant larger awards  natural disasters such as catastrophic hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  floods and fires  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment that affect market prices of investments and the income and returns on investments  and inflationary pressures that may tend to affect the size of losses experienced by ceding primary insurers 
the reinsurance industry is highly competitive and dynamic  and market changes may affect  among other things  demand for our products  changes in investment opportunities and the performance thereof  changes in the products offered by us or changes in our business strategy 
reinsurance treaties that are placed by intermediaries are typically for one year terms with a substantial number that are written or renewed on january each year 
other significant renewal dates include april  july and october the january  renewal period was marked by continuing intensified competitive conditions in terms of premium rates and treaty terms and conditions in both the property and casualty segments of the marketplace 
these conditions have been worsened due to large domestic primary companies retaining more of their business and ceding less premiums to reinsurers 
commencing in late  in addition to our core business  we expanded into specialty classes of reinsurance business  including marine and aviation and space in  surety and fidelity in  and accident and health in in  we discontinued our aviation and space lines of business 
in force business at january   rcre had approximately renewable in force reinsurance treaties such renewal is subject to negotiation and evaluation during the renewal period  with approximately million of estimated annualized net premiums written  compared to million at january  and million at january   representing a decline of and an increase of over the prior year  respectively 
such in force premiums at january  represent estimated annualized premiums from treaties entered into during and the january  renewal period that are expected to generate net premiums written during such treaties at january  are estimated to generate approximately million of net premiums written over the month period ending december  without taking into account certain factors  including the possibilities that i several treaties entered into in that are scheduled to expire during the remainder of may be renewed and ii additional treaties may be bound during the decline in in force business of in compared to is due to several factors which include i discontinuing aviation and space business in  ii non renewals in other classes of business  due to a our adherence to underwriting standards in competitive market conditions and b the effect on cedents of our poor underwriting performance  coupled with a decline in rcre s am best rating from a to a 
such decline was partially offset by increased in force premiums in accident health business where significant underwriting capacity has exited the market since  and we believe reinsurance pricing improvements have occurred in and results of operations we had consolidated comprehensive losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and consolidated comprehensive income of million for the year ended december  our comprehensive income or loss is composed of net income and the change in unrealized appreciation of investments 
net loss for the year ended december  was million and net income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
after tax realized investment gains losses of million  million and million were also included in net income for  and  respectively 
net income for the years ended december   and included income losses of million  million  and million  respectively  representing our equity in the net income loss of investee companies accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
net loss for the year ended december  also included a loss of  from a cumulative effect of an accounting change for start up costs

approximately  and of net premiums written in  and  respectively  were generated from companies in which we have invested or committed to invest funds integrated transactions 
approximately  and of net premiums written in  and  respectively  was produced from specialty classes of business 
specialty classes of business accounted for and of the increase in net premiums written for and  respectively 
approximately  and of net premiums written in  and  respectively  were from non united states clients  which are lloyd s syndicates or are located in the united kingdom  bermuda and continental europe 
net premiums written in includes approximately million related to a group of property reinsurance treaties that expired in covering crop hail business underwritten on behalf of a start up entity formed by trident ii  lp this business was protected by extensive aggregate excess of loss retrocession and generated a profit based upon underwriting results 
we do not expect to renew these treaties in net premiums written in for other business was reduced by million for the retrocession of a treaty which covers future multiple rocket launches that was recorded in the reduction of net premiums written resulting from this retrocession increased the commission and operating expense ratio components of the statutory composite ratio by percentage points  but had no impact on operating results 
consistent with our strategy of writing a small number of large treaties for our core business  two clients contributed approximately million or of total net premiums written  with the largest client contributing approximately and the second contributing 
approximately of the business written from the client that contributed and all of the business written from the client that contributed are part of an integrated transaction  and such business is subject to renewal at our option for two and four remaining years  respectively 
in  three clients contributed approximately million  or  of total net premiums written  with the largest client contributing approximately and the remaining two contributing and  respectively 
in  five clients contributed approximately million  or  of total net premiums written  with the largest client contributing approximately and the remaining four contributing from to 
rcre s ceded premiums increased to million in  compared to million in and million in such ceded premiums primarily relate to rcre s property  multi line  marine  aviation and space reinsurance business  for which we seek to reduce rcre s exposure to large and catastrophic losses 
since the fourth quarter of  we have purchased additional retrocessional protection to reduce rcre s exposures to both space and aviation risks 
effective july   rcre also purchased a retrocessional treaty for a one year period covering earthquake  wind and other property catastrophe perils for million in excess of a million retention per occurrence 
see results of operations aviation business and risk retention  business retrocessional arrangements and note of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 
while not anticipated  prior to the asset sale  the reduction or loss of business assumed from one or more large clients could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations to the extent not offset by new business 
operating costs and expenses one traditional method of measuring the underwriting performance of a property casualty insurer  such as rcre  is the statutory combined ratio 
this ratio  which is based upon statutory accounting principles which differ from generally accepted accounting principles in several respects  reflects underwriting experience  but does not reflect income from investments 
a statutory combined ratio under indicates underwriting profitability  while a combined ratio exceeding indicates an underwriting loss 
set forth below are rcre s statutory combined ratios for the years ended december   and and the estimated aggregate statutory combined ratios for domestic reinsurers and domestic broker market reinsurers based on data reported by the reinsurance association of america raa as of such dates years ended december  claims and claims expenses commissions and brokerage other operating expenses statutory combined ratio domestic reinsurer aggregate statutory combined ratios after tax underwriting losses for the years indicated were as follows dollars in millions years ended december  after tax underwriting loss amount per share basic statutory combined ratio after tax underwriting results for and reflect very poor underwriting performance in competitive market conditions 
rcre s and statutory combined ratios were adversely affected by underwriting results from the sources identified below  which added points and points to the combined ratios excluding operating expenses  respectively dollars in millions year underwriting impact managing underwriting space agency aviation total net premiums written earned premiums after tax underwriting loss amount per share basic combined ratio effect in percentage points year underwriting impact managing underwriting space agency aviation total net premiums written earned premiums after tax underwriting loss amount per share basic combined ratio effect in percentage points managing underwriting agency as identified above  during and  we recorded after tax underwriting losses of million  or per share  and million  or cents per share  respectively  from reinsurance on casualty and multi line business produced by the managing underwriting agency 
we also recorded related after tax investment losses of million  or per share  and  or per share  in net realized investment losses in and  respectively 
we have discontinued our underwriting relationship with the managing underwriting agency 
the business and operations of the managing underwriting agency are in run off 
the total estimated ultimate net premiums written and earned by rcre on all business produced by the managing underwriting agency recorded from inception in late through december  are approximately million and million  respectively  resulting in an inception to date after tax underwriting loss of million 
net reserves for claims and claims expenses for this business approximated million at december  see folksamerica transaction for a discussion of a million escrow fund relating to such reserves in connection with the sale of our reinsurance business to folksamerica 
space aviation business as identified above  during and  rcre recorded after tax underwriting losses of million  or per share  and million  or per share  respectively  for its space and aviation lines of business 
during  rcre discontinued both lines of business 
space business the total estimated ultimate net premiums written and earned by rcre for space business from inception in through december  are million each  resulting in an inception to date after tax underwriting loss of million 
net reserves for claims and claims expenses for space business approximated million at december  at december   all satellite treaties have expired except for one treaty covering future multiple rocket launches which was retroceded in aviation business the total estimated ultimate net premiums written and earned by rcre for aviation business from inception in through december  are million and million  respectively  resulting in an inception to date after tax underwriting loss of million 
net reserves for aviation business approximated million at december  included in the after tax underwriting loss for aviation business are incurred losses for the swiss air and korean air crashes and certain crashes  including the egypt air  american airlines  korean air and china air crashes 
the additional loss recorded in for the swiss air crash was based on a reallocation of the million expected industry loss between the plane manufacturer and swiss air 
this reallocation adversely affected rcre s gross loss 
the gross loss associated with the swiss air crash reported as of december  had exhausted rcre s retrocessional protections applicable to this occurrence 
therefore  none of such additional loss reported was ceded to retrocessionaires 
to the extent that either the expected industry loss increases or additional loss is allocated to the plane manufacturer  rcre could record additional losses 
for example  if the expected industry loss increases by approximately million  and assuming additional loss reallocations such that one third of the industry loss is allocated to the plane manufacturer  rcre would record additional aggregate loss net of additional reinstatement premiums of approximately million after tax 
however  we cannot be certain of the ultimate industry loss or the final allocation of liability between the plane manufacturer and swiss air  and there can be no assurances that the ultimate industry loss will not be larger or that the plane manufacturer will not be allocated a greater proportion of the industry loss 
with respect to all other reinsured crashes which occurred through december   we currently believe that rcre s gross loss will not exhaust rcre s reinsurance protections although rcre s net loss could increase within these protections based on the ultimate industry loss  the ultimate allocation of losses between the plane manufacturers and the airlines and other factors 
for the year ended december   aviation assumed gross premiums earned  retroceded premiums earned  and net earned premiums were million  million and million  respectively 
while rcre discontinued writing aviation business in  rcre currently has a number of assumed treaties that will continue to expose it to significant risk of aviation losses through current estimates for gross aviation premiums that will be earned beyond aggregate approximately million 
retrocessional premium charges to be recorded for retrocessional treaties presently in force that expire during total approximately million 
such retrocessional premium costs do not include additional retrocessional premium amounts that will be purchased to provide folksamerica with additional retrocessional protection in connection with the sale of our reinsurance business to folksamerica 
following the egypt air crash in october  rcre exhausted its initial layer of retrocessional protection for aviation exposures 
since october  rcre s initial retention as well as its total retention for aviation exposures are contingent on the size of insured industry losses  which could materially impact the recoveries under such retrocessions and therefore the net loss to us 
based on information currently available to us  we believe that rcre s maximum exposures net of retrocessional recoveries and reinstatement premiums for future commercial airline losses vary depending on i the size of insured industry losses  ii the declining gross loss exposures as current in force business expires  and iii the application of retrocessional protections which expire throughout based on such current information  set forth below is our estimate of after tax losses for rcre s maximum exposures for the size industry loss and the time period presented in millions to industry loss  year from to january march n a april june july september october december year we are presently evaluating the impact of recent commercial airline crashes that occurred in  including the alaska air crash 
other underwriting loss activity except for multi line business  all other classes of business also contributed to the underwriting loss  with the largest contribution from property business 
the after tax underwriting loss for property business approximated million which included after tax losses of million for two large catastrophes in rouge steel plant in dearborn  michigan and french storm losses 
the underwriting loss included an after tax underwriting loss of million for a property loss on a finite risk treaty 
prior year development estimates of prior accident year claims were increased by approximately million in which added points to the combined ratio 
a substantial portion of this amount stemmed from i our review of additional claims information and our continuing underwriting and actuarial analysis of the business produced by the managing underwriting agency  ii notification of additional satellite losses received in pertaining to  iii aviation losses  principally the previously discussed swiss air crash  and iv property losses reported on several international treaties that are in run off 
estimates of prior accident year claims were reduced by approximately million in primarily due to favorable claim development in the property and multi line classes of business 
claims and claims expenses generally represent our most significant and uncertain costs 
reserves for these expenses are estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given time of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims to cost based on facts and circumstances then known 
the reserves are based on estimates of claims and claims expenses incurred and  therefore  the amount ultimately paid may be more or less than such estimates 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating claim reserves are exacerbated for reinsurers by the significant periods of time the tail that often elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the primary insurer and  ultimately  to the reinsurer  and the primary insurer s payment of that loss and subsequent indemnification by the reinsurer 
as a consequence  actual claims and claims expenses paid may deviate  perhaps materially  from estimates reflected in our reserves reported in our financial statements 
the estimation of reserves by new reinsurers  such as us  may be less reliable than the reserve estimations of a reinsurer with an established volume of business and claims history 
to the extent reserves prove to be inadequate  we may have to augment such reserves and incur a charge to earnings 
acquisition costs in pricing rcre s reinsurance treaties  we focus on many factors  including exposure to claims and commissions and brokerage expenses 
commissions and brokerage expenses are acquisition costs that generally vary by the type of treaty and line of business  and are considered by our underwriting and actuarial staff in evaluating the adequacy of premium writings 
in a number of reinsurance treaties  provisional commissions are initially paid and subsequently increased or decreased  subject to a minimum and maximum amount  depending upon the claims and claims expenses experience of the assumed business 
we record the commission increase or decrease in accordance with contractual terms based on the expected ultimate experience of the contract 
the claims and commissions and brokerage ratios reflect our business mix 
other operating expenses other operating expenses were million in  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for  the statutory operating expense ratio declined to  compared with for and in the decline in our operating expense ratio was due to a decrease in other operating expenses and an increase in our net premiums written from the comparable prior year period 
in addition  commencing in  we allocated certain compensation and other operating expenses related to investment activities in the amount of million to net investment income based on internal time studies 
such allocations were not made in prior periods 
due to such allocations  the statutory operating expense ratio improved by approximately one point and net investment income was reduced by approximately per share  with no overall effect on operating results 
on a pro forma basis  the statutory operating expense ratios for and would have been and  respectively 
foreign exchange pre tax foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded separately from statutory underwriting results and are therefore excluded from the statutory composite ratio 
unhedged monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  with the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses recognized in income 
for the years ended december   and  pretax foreign exchange gains and losses were   and  respectively 
such future gains or losses may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates which are unpredictable and could be material 
for additional discussion  see market sensitive instruments and risk management below 
risk retention given rcre s current level of surplus  under its current underwriting guidelines  the maximum net retention on any one claim for a given property or casualty treaty risk is generally million 
we monitor rcre s earthquake and wind exposures and continuously reevaluate its estimated probable maximum pre tax loss for such exposures through the use of modeling techniques 
we generally seek to limit rcre s probable maximum pre tax net loss to no more than of its statutory surplus for severe catastrophic events such as hurricanes and earthquakes that could be expected to occur once in every years 
this limitation includes combined exposure to underwriting losses  reinstatement costs for retrocessional arrangements which may be in force at the time of the losses resulting from the catastrophic event  and losses that rcre may be exposed to as a result of its privately held investments in insurance and insurance related entities 
while we believe rcre s risk management techniques are adequate  we cannot assure you that rcre will not suffer pre tax losses greater than of its statutory surplus from a catastrophic event due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating the frequency and severity of such exposures 
in addition  we believe that we cannot reasonably estimate rcre s exposure to unrealized investment losses if any that may result from rcre s investments in publicly traded securities of insurance and insurance related entities 
with respect to integrated solutions where we combine an equity  equity like or debt investment in a client company with the purchase by such client of reinsurance from rcre  we generally limit rcre s combined underwriting and investment exposure to pre tax losses on any individual client to no more than of rcre s total statutory surplus 
we continue to evaluate rcre s potential catastrophe exposure  including both gross loss estimates and the impact of available reinsurance protection 
while we believe our management of catastrophe exposures and underwriting guidelines are adequate  an extremely large catastrophic event  multiple catastrophic events or other unforeseen events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
net investment income at december   approximately of our invested assets consisted of fixed maturity and short term investments  compared to at december  net investment income was approximately million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
such amounts for  and are net of investment expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
the investment expense amounts include investment advisory fees of million  million and million  respectively 
the net investment income is also net of million for the payment of interest expense in connection with the settlement of satellite losses 
our investment yields at amortized cost were as follows for the periods set forth below years ended december  investment yields pre tax net of tax our investment yields are reflective of a significant allocation of the total investment portfolio in equity securities  which yield less current income than fixed maturity investments 
at december  and  investments in public and private equity securities approximated and  respectively  of total cash and invested assets 
additionally  such investment yields exclude our equity in the net income or loss of private equity investments accounted for under the equity method 
net realized gains losses on investments our source of net realized investment gains losses were as follows in thousands years ended december  net realized investment gain losses fixed maturity securities   publicly traded equity securities    privately held securities    sub total   income tax expense benefit   net realized investment gains losses  net of   tax income taxes our income tax benefit  effective tax rate of and the income tax benefit are less than the statutory rate on pre tax operating income due primarily to tax exempt income and the dividends received deductions 
the  and gross deferred income tax benefits of approximately million  million and million  respectively  which are assets considered recoverable from future taxable income  resulted from temporary differences between financial and taxable income 
the net deferred income tax asset at december  was million 
we periodically evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for any portion of the deferred tax asset that our management believes will not be realized based on current and future operating performance and available tax planning strategies 
while we believe that a valuation allowance is not necessary at december   continued future comprehensive losses or future decisions with respect to business strategy following the sale of our reinsurance business may result in the establishment of a valuation allowance in future financial statements 
we have a net operating loss carryforward which expires in  for which we have established a deferred income tax asset of million at december  the repurchase of our common stock held by xl capital resulted in a change in ownership by shareholders 
if  in the ensuing three years  there is more than a additional change in ownership by shareholders  an ownership change will have taken place for federal income tax purposes 
if such ownership change occurs  the amount of loss carryforwards that can be used in any subsequent year may be severely limited and could be eliminated in certain circumstances 
see the section of our special meeting proxy statement entitled risk factors the financing of our business plan may cause us to forfeit certain tax benefits  which is incorporated by reference 
investments a principal component of our investment strategy is investing a significant portion of rcre s invested assets in publicly traded and privately held equity securities  primarily issued by insurance and reinsurance companies and companies providing services to the insurance industry 
cash and fixed maturity investments and  if necessary  the sale of marketable equity securities will be used to support shorter term liquidity requirements 
as a significant portion of rcre s investment portfolio consists of equity securities issued by insurance and reinsurance companies and companies providing services to the insurance industry  the equity portfolio lacks industry diversification and will be particularly subject to the performance of the insurance industry 
unlike fixed income securities  equity securities such as common stocks  including the equity securities in which rcre has invested  generally are not and will not be rated by any nationally recognized rating service 
the values of equity securities generally are more dependent on the financial condition of the issuer and less dependent on fluctuations in interest rates than are the values of fixed income securities 
the market value of equity securities generally is regarded as more volatile than the market value of fixed income securities 
the effects of such volatility on rcre s equity portfolio could be exacerbated to the extent that such portfolio is concentrated in the insurance industry and in relatively few issuers 
from december  to march   the market value of our public equity portfolio has decreased by approximately million due to general stock market volatility  market decline in the property and casualty insurance sector and the poor operating performance of several of our investee companies 
for additional discussion  see market sensitive instruments and risk management below 
as our investment strategy is to invest a significant portion of rcre s investment portfolio in equity securities  our investment income in any fiscal period may be smaller  as a percentage of investments  and less predictable than that of other insurance and or reinsurance companies  and net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments may have a greater effect on our results of operations or stockholders equity at the end of any fiscal period than would be the case for other insurance and or reinsurance companies 
since the realization of gains and losses on equity investments is not generally predictable  such gains and losses have differed and will differ significantly from period to period 
variability and declines in our results of operations could be further exacerbated by private equity investments in start up companies which are accounted for under the equity method 
such start up companies may be expected initially to generate operating losses 
investments included in rcre s private portfolio include securities issued by privately held companies and by publicly traded companies that are generally restricted as to resale or are otherwise illiquid and do not have readily ascertainable market values 
the risk of investing in such securities is generally greater than the risk of investing in securities of widely held  publicly traded companies 
lack of a secondary market and resale restrictions may result in an inability by us to sell a security at a price that would otherwise be obtainable if such restrictions did not exist and may substantially delay the sale of a security we seek to sell 
at december   cash and invested assets totaled approximately million  consisting of million of cash and short term investments  million of publicly traded fixed maturity investments  million of publicly traded equity securities  and million of privately held securities 
included in privately held securities are investments totaling million which are accounted for under the equity method 
at december   rcre s private equity portfolio consisted of investments  with additional investment portfolio commitments in an aggregate amount of approximately million 
in  we completed one integrated transaction with an existing client of rcre  a follow on investment in an existing investee and one additional investment commitment 
in addition  we divested four of rcre s investments 
see note under the caption investment information of the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements 
in october  we provided million in financing on a fully secured basis to a managing general agency  and received a related reinsurance commitment expected to generate an aggregate of million of reinsurance premiums over three years pursuant to terms and conditions that we believe are more favorable than those available in the open market 
on march   we extended a loan in an aggregate principal amount of million to american independent insurance holding company aihc  one of our investee companies 
the loan is secured by a second priority pledge of the capital stock of aihc and assets of aihc  and matures on september  which date may be extended to march  upon the occurrence of certain events 
the net proceeds of the loan were contributed to the surplus of aihc s subsidiary  american independent insurance company 
in connection with the loan  we were issued warrants in addition to the warrants issued to us in connection with a prior loan to aihc granting us the right to acquire equity in aihc 
see note under the caption investment information of the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for certain information regarding rcre s publicly traded and privately held securities and their carrying values  and commitments made by rcre relating to its privately held securities 
at december   approximately of rcre s fixed maturity and short term investments were rated investment grade by moody s or standard poor s and had an average quality rating of aa and an average duration of approximately years 
at december   rcre is obligated under letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately million  which secure certain reinsurance obligations 
securities with a carrying value of approximately million have been pledged as collateral for these letters of credit 
rcre has not invested in derivative financial instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps  or options or other financial instruments with similar characteristics such as interest rate caps or floors and fixed rate loan commitments 
rcre s portfolio includes market sensitive instruments  such as mortgage backed securities  which are subject to prepayment risk and changes in market value in connection with changes in interest rates 
rcre s investments in mortgage backed securities  which amounted to approximately million at december   or of cash and invested assets  are classified as available for sale and are not held for trading purposes 
market sensitive instruments and risk management in accordance with the sec s financial reporting release no 
 the following analysis presents hypothetical losses in cash flows  earnings and fair values of market sensitive instruments which are held by rcre as of december  and are sensitive to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity security prices 
this risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the following sensitivity analysis represent forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses 
market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument and is comprised of several components  including liquidity  basis and price risks 
the focus of the sec s market risk rules is on price risk 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we employ sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings  fair values or cash flows of rcre s financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the following sensitivity analysis consist of all of our cash and invested assets  excluding investments carried under the equity method of accounting 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risks on the public and private equity securities included in rcre s investment portfolio 
all of rcre s publicly traded equity securities and privately held securities were issued by insurance and reinsurance companies or companies providing services to the insurance industry 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate rcre s market exposure on these securities 
investments included in rcre s private portfolio include securities issued by privately held companies and securities issued by public companies that are generally restricted as to resale or are otherwise illiquid and do not have readily ascertainable market values 
investments in privately held securities issued by privately and publicly held companies may include both equity securities and securities convertible into  or exercisable for  equity securities some of which may have fixed maturities 
rcre s publicly traded and privately held equity securities at december   which are carried at a fair value of million and million  respectively  have exposure to price risk 
the estimated potential losses in fair value for rcre s publicly traded and privately held equity portfolios resulting from a hypothetical decrease in quoted market prices  dealer quotes or fair value are million and million  respectively 
interest rate risk the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate adverse shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would result in a decrease in total return of  which would produce a decrease in market value of million on rcre s fixed maturity investment portfolio valued at million at december  there would be no material impact on rcre s short term investments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have foreign currency risk on both reinsurance balances receivable and reinsurance balances payable  including claims and claims expenses 
we do not currently utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency movements 
at december   the substantial majority of the company s net receivable payable position was denominated in united states dollars 
at such date  the largest foreign currency exposure related to liabilities denominated in british pounds sterling 
we had a net liability balance in sterling of approximately million 
a increase in the sterling united states dollar exchange rate would have resulted in a loss to us of  given our limited amount of net asset or liability balances in other foreign currencies  any currency movement of would not produce a material loss for purposes of this discussion 
liquidity and capital resources we are a holding company and currently have no significant operations or assets other than our ownership of the capital stock of rcre 
we rely on cash dividends and distributions from rcre to make payments  including for any operating expenses that we may incur and for any dividends or stock repurchases as our board of directors may determine 
our board currently does not intend to declare dividends or make any other distributions 
however  our board intends to make a determination regarding stock repurchases following the consummation of the asset sale 
see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters dividends and the sections included in our special meeting proxy statement entitled risk factors we currently do not anticipate paying dividends  but may consider share repurchases and dividend and stock repurchase policy 
rcre s ability to pay dividends or make distributions to us is dependent upon its ability to achieve satisfactory underwriting and investment results and to meet regulatory standards of the state of nebraska  as described below 
there are presently no contractual restrictions on rcre s payment of dividends or the making of distributions to us 
we intend to cause rcre to make an extraordinary distribution to us following the asset sale 
see general rcre distribution 
nebraska insurance laws provide that  without prior approval of the nebraska director  rcre cannot pay a dividend or make a distribution together with other dividends or distributions paid during the preceding months that exceeds the greater of i of statutory surplus as of the preceding december or ii statutory net income from operations from the preceding calendar year not including realized capital gains 
net income exclusive of realized capital gains not previously distributed or paid as dividends from the preceding two calendar years may be carried forward for dividends and distribution purposes 
any proposed dividend or distribution in excess of such amount is called an extraordinary dividend or distribution and may not be paid until either it has been approved  or a day waiting period has passed during which it has not been disapproved  by the nebraska director 
notwithstanding the foregoing  nebraska insurance laws provide that any distribution that is a dividend may be paid by rcre only out of earned surplus arising from its business  which is defined as unassigned funds surplus as reported in the statutory financial statement filed by rcre with the nebraska insurance department for the most recent year  including any surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluations of assets 
any distribution that is a dividend and that is in excess of rcre s unassigned funds  exclusive of any surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets  will be deemed an extraordinary dividend subject to the foregoing requirements 
due to the distribution that was required to be made in connection with the xl capital stock repurchase  we may not declare any other distribution for twelve months from the closing date of the stock repurchase unless such subsequent distribution is approved by the nebraska director 
see business insurance regulation and note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details regarding statutory restrictions on distributions by rcre 
we  rcre and cross river file consolidated federal income tax returns and have entered into a tax sharing agreement the tax sharing agreement  allocating the consolidated income tax liability on a separate return basis 
pursuant to the tax sharing agreement  rcre and cross river make tax sharing payments to us based on such allocation 
net cash flow from operating activities for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively  consisting principally of premiums received  investment income excluding net realized investment gains  offset by operating costs and expenses 
the primary sources of liquidity for risk capital reinsurance are net cash flow from operating activities  principally premiums received  the receipt of dividends and interest on investments and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments 
rcre s cash flow is also affected by claims payments  some of which have been large 
for example  we experienced negative cash flow from operations of approximately million in the fourth quarter as a result of significant paid loss activity 
such situations could reoccur as our book of business matures  claims are settled and if we continue to experience poor underwriting performance 
therefore  our cash flow could fluctuate significantly from period to period 
rcre does not currently have any material commitments for any capital expenditures over the next months 
we expect that our financing and operational needs for the foreseeable future will be met by our balance of cash and short term investments  as well as by funds generated from operations 
following the sale of the reinsurance operations to folksamerica  our objective will be to pursue business combinations and ventures with operating businesses 
we have not yet identified any specific business opportunities 
accordingly  we may need to secure additional financing to carry out our business plan 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in the implementation of our current or future business strategy 
see the section of our special meeting proxy statement entitled risk factors risks relating to our business after the asset sale  which is incorporated by reference 
at december   our consolidated stockholders equity totaled million  or per share based on issued and outstanding shares  and per share on a diluted basis which includes outstanding dilutive warrants and options 
at such date  statutory surplus of rcre was approximately million 
as a result of the xl capital stock repurchase  stockholders equity has been reduced by million and book value per share has increased to per share on a fully diluted basis 
rcre s statutory surplus was also reduced by million to million due to the sale to xl capital of the stock and warrants in larc holdings  ltd 
and annuity and life re holdings  ltd  based on their statutory carrying values at december  based on data from the raa  after giving effect to the xl capital stock repurchase  rcre was the th largest domestic broker market oriented reinsurer as measured by its million of statutory surplus 
accounting pronouncements derivatives and hedging in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that all derivative financial instruments be recognized in the statement of financial position as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
if a derivative instrument is not designated as a hedging instrument  gains or losses resulting from changes in fair values of such derivative are required to be recognized in earnings in the period of the change 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be designated as a hedging instrument  in which case the recording of the changes in fair value will depend on the specific exposure being hedged 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes on fair values or cash flows 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with initial application as of the beginning of the first quarter of the applicable fiscal year 
we will adopt this statement in the first quarter of historically  we have not invested in derivative financial instruments 
however  derivatives may be embedded in other financial instruments  such as convertible securities and prepayment options in mortgages 
if the embedded derivative meets certain criteria  it must be bifurcated from the host contract and separately accounted for consistent with other derivatives 
rcre s portfolio includes market sensitive instruments  such as convertible securities and mortgage backed securities  which are subject to prepayment risk and changes in market value in connection with changes in interest rates 
our investments in mortgage backed securities are classified as available for sale and are not held for trading purposes 
assuming the current investment strategy at the time of adoption  our presentation of financial information under the new statement will not be materially different than the current presentation 
start up costs effective january   we changed our method of accounting for start up costs in accordance with the accounting standards executive committee s statement of position sop reporting on the costs of start up activities 
this statement requires costs of start up activities  including organization costs  to be expensed as incurred 
the change in accounting principle resulted in the write off of the start up costs capitalized as of january  for us and rcre s investee companies carried under the equity method of accounting 
the cumulative effect of the write off  which totals  after tax  or per share  has been expensed and is included in the net loss 
see note of the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements 
insurance regulation rcre  in common with other insurers  is subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in the various states and jurisdictions in which it transacts business 
the laws and regulations of the state of nebraska  the domicile of rcre  have the most significant impact on its operations 
from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance and reinsurance industry  some of which could have an effect on reinsurers 
among the proposals that have in the past been  or are at present being considered  are i the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to  or in lieu of  the current system of state regulation of insurers and ii proposals in various state legislatures some of which proposals have been enacted to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the naic 
we are unable to predict whether any of such laws and regulations will be adopted  the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted  or the effect  if any  these developments would have on our operations and financial condition 
see business insurance regulation 
in march  the naic adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles project that will generally be applied to all insurance and reinsurance company financial statements filed with insurance regulatory authorities as early as the statutory filings made in although the codification is not expected to materially affect many existing statutory accounting practices presently followed by most insurers and reinsurers such as rcre  there are several accounting practices that may be changed 
the most significant change would involve accounting for deferred income taxes  which change would require a deferred tax liability to be recorded for unrealized appreciation of invested assets  net of available deferred tax assets  that would result in a reduction to statutory surplus 
if such requirement had been in effect in  the statutory surplus of rcre at december  would have remained at million 
effects of inflation the effects of inflation on us are implicitly considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claims expenses 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled
