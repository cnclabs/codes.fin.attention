sales the company s sales of million in increased million or as compared to sales of million in the increase in sales was principally due to higher sales of million  million and million within the transportation  medical and industrial segments  which increased  and  respectively 
transportation sales have increased primarily due to higher volume sales in both the vehicle and avionics amlcd markets and also due to higher crt sales volumes 
sales volumes in the medical market have increased primarily in the medical instrument and medical monitor markets 
industrial market sales have increased due to higher volumes to the wireless test  gas pump and industrial controls industries 
the company s sales in decreased million or as compared to million in the decrease in sales was principally due to a slowdown across all of the company s markets in both europe and north america due to customers pushing out shipment dates and reduced sales due to weak end product sales 
the company presently expects sales for fiscal year to increase approximately in its continuing business 
after adjusting for approximately million of military amlcd business in and million in  and million for the acquisition of allbrite technologies  inc the company s revenue target is million for international sales  net of intercompany eliminations  increased by to million in as compared to million recorded in  and increased in from sales of million 
the increase in international sales was due primarily to increased sales in existing market segments in the company s foreign markets 
as a percentage of total sales  international sales decreased to in from in and increased from in the decline in international sales as a percentage of total sales was mainly attributable to the higher sales volumes in gross profit the company s gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in the decrease was primarily a result of the non recurring charges of million  or of sales  which was recorded in the fourth quarter  continuing manufacturing problems associated with the military amlcd products  lower el margins associated with our new production facility and increased inventory reserves end user products 
these decreases were partially offset by better yields on the lcd products and higher margins and increased volumes of crt and commercial amlcd products 
the company s gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in this decrease was largely attributable to increased inventory reserves for the end user products and start up manufacturing issues associated with the military avionics amlcd products 
for  the company expects gross margins to be approximately research and development research and development expenses of million in decreased million or from in the decrease was due to lower development effort associated with both the commercial and military color amlcd products and tighter cost controls 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in research due to less contract funding of million received in research and development expenses increased million or to million in from million in the increase was due primarily to additional expenses related to the development of new technologies and product engineering associated with the development of color amlcd products in both the commercial and military avionics businesses

the goodwill is being amortized over a ten year period  resulting in operating expenses of  per year 
goodwill amortization is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
in connection with the company s acquisition of its finland operation in january  the company exchanged common stock with a fair market value based upon an independent valuation equivalent to the value of the business acquired 
due to historical losses of this business and the expectation of future losses  the value of the common stock paid was less than the fair market value of the net assets acquired 
this required the company to write fixed assets down to zero and to record negative goodwill on its balance sheet for the remaining amount of the excess fair market value of the net assets acquired over the purchase price 
amortization of this negative goodwill has created a positive offset to operating expenses in the amount of  per year

dpix llc manufactures and sells amorphous silicon thin film transistor arrays for use in x ray digital detectors and liquid crystal displays 
the investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
as part of the acquisition agreement  there was a disproportionate allocation of profit and losses where the company recognized the first million of losses incurred 
the company has written off the entire investment of million  which included transaction costs of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based upon the actual losses incurred since the date of acquisition and the belief that the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses are related to timing differences in the receipt and payment of funds in various currencies and the conversion of cash accounts denominated in foreign currencies to the applicable functional currency 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses amounted to gains of million in and million in and a loss of  in these amounts are comprised of realized gains and losses on cash transactions involving various currencies and unrealized gains and losses related to foreign currency denominated receivables and payables resulting from exchange rate fluctuations between the various currencies in which the company conducts business

forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities litigation reform act of that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the company s business  management s beliefs and assumptions made by management 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements due to numerous factors including the following domestic and international business and economic conditions  changes in growth in the flat panel monitor industry  changes in customer demand or ordering patterns  changes in the competitive environment including pricing pressures or technological changes  continued success in technological advances  shortages of manufacturing capacities from our third party partners  final settlement of contractual liabilities  future production variables impacting excess inventory and other risk factors described below 
the forward looking statements contained in this report speak only as of the date on which they are made  and the company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report 
if the company does update one or more forward looking statements  investors and others should not conclude that the company will make additional updates with respect thereto or with respect to other forward looking statements 
outlook issues and uncertainties the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating the company s future financial performance and prospects for growth 
competition the market for information displays is highly competitive  and the company expects this to continue 
the company believes that over time this competition will have the effect of reducing average selling prices of flat panel displays 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater name recognition and financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company  and competitors of the company have made and continue to make significant investments in the construction of manufacturing facilities for amlcds and other advanced displays 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing products that would render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
to the extent the company is unable to compete effectively against its competitors  whether due to such practices or otherwise  its financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
development of new products and risks of technological change the company s future results of operations will depend upon its ability to improve and market its existing products and to successfully develop  manufacture and market new products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to improve and market its existing products or develop and market new products  or that technological developments will not cause the company s products or technology to become obsolete or noncompetitive 
even successful new product introductions typically result in pressure on gross margins during the initial phases as costs of manufacturing start up activities are spread over lower initial sales volumes 
the company has experienced lower than expected yields with respect to new products and processes in the past 
these low yields have  and will continue to have  a negative impact on gross margins 
in addition  customer relationships can be negatively impacted due to production problems and late delivery of shipments 
a portion of the company s flat panel products rely on el technology  which currently constitutes only a small portion of the information display market 
through the acquisition of standish industries  inc  the company has diversified its display products and expanded its addressable market significantly to include flat panel passive liquid crystal display applications 
the company s future success will depend in part upon increased market acceptance of existing el  passive lcd and active matrix lcd technologies  and other future technological developments 
in that regard  the company s competitors are investing substantial resources in the development and manufacture of displays using a number of alternative technologies 
in the event these efforts result in the development of products that offer significant advantages over the company s products  and the company is unable to improve its technology or develop or acquire an alternative technology that is more competitive  the company s business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
level of advanced research and development funding the company s advanced research and development activities have been significantly funded by outside sources  including agencies of the united states and finnish governments and private sector companies 
the company s recently funded research and development activities have principally focused on multi color and full color displays  miniature displays  low power displays  advanced packaging and other applications 
the actual funding that will be recognized in future periods is subject to wide fluctuation due to a variety of factors including government appropriation of the necessary funds and the level of effort spent on contracts by the company 
within congress  there has been significant debate on the level of the funding to be made available to programs that have historically supported the company s research activities 
additionally  government research and development funding has been gradually shifting to a more commercial approach  and contractors are increasingly required to share in the development costs 
this trend is likely to continue  which could increase the company s net research and development expenses 
while the company has historically experienced significant decline of external research funding  additional losses or substantial reductions of such funding could adversely affect the company s results of operations and its ability to continue research and development activities at current levels 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
international operations and currency exchange rate fluctuations shipments to customers outside of north america accounted for approximately  and  of the company s sales in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company anticipates that international shipments will continue to account for a significant portion of its sales 
as a result  the company is subject to risks associated with international operations  including trade restrictions  overlapping or differing tax structures  changes in tariffs  export license requirements and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations including  in finland  relations with national labor unions 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
declining military expenditures the company s sales associated with military applications have been increasing 
however  military capital expenditure levels have been declining for several years and depend largely on factors outside of the company s control 
the company has announced its exit of the military avionics amlcd product line and as a result military sales will not continue at current levels 
in addition  as a result of the reduction in military sales  several key suppliers have threatened to halt production of critical components 
although the company believes it has reached agreement with each of its critical vendors  no assurance can be given that critical material supply will be available when needed 
the company continues to develop strategic relationships with suppliers 
however  there can be no assurance given that these strategic relationships will continue in the future and the company will receive the critical components required to meet production and shipment schedules 
the company has fixed price contracts for flat panel displays with a small number of military avionics customers 
as a result of the performance requirements for these displays and difficulties in the manufacturing process  the company has experienced difficulties in satisfying its obligations under these contracts and generally has not realized a profit selling these products 
although the company has successfully renegotiated specifications and prices under certain of these contracts  the company has not been able to renegotiate the terms of all such contracts or achieve a level of profitability on these products that would justify continuing sales 
as previously announced   the company will not seek new contracts or contract extensions when the existing contracts expire in fiscal the company s inability to satisfy its obligations under existing contracts could result in contractual liabilities to the company  a reduction in the company s revenues and earnings and the impairment of the company s ability to continue to participate in the military avionics market and potentially the commercial avionics market 
effects of quarterly fluctuations in operating results results of operations have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter in the past  and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
various factors  including timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  disruption in the supply of components for the company s products  changes in product mix  capacity utilization  the timing of orders from major customers  production delays or inefficiencies  inventory obsolescence charges  warranty return rate fluctuations related to newer products  changes in estimates associated with the non recurring charges  the timing of expenses and other factors affect results of operations 
quarterly fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
the company s backlog at the beginning of each quarter does not normally include all orders needed to achieve expected sales for the quarter 
consequently  the company is dependent upon obtaining orders for shipment in a particular quarter to achieve its sales objectives for that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on expected future sales 
if sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  operating results may be adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualatative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio  and short term and long term debt obligations 
the company mitigates its risk by diversifying its investments among high credit quality securities in accordance with the company s investment policy 
the company believes that its net income or cash flow exposure relating to rate changes for short term and long term debt obligations is not material 
the company primarily enters into debt obligations to support capital expenditures and working capital needs 
the company does not hedge any interest rate exposures 
interest expense is affected by the general level of us interest rates and or libor 
increases in interest expense resulting from an increase in interest rates would be offset by a corresponding increase in interest earned on the company s investments 
the finnish markka is the functional currency of the company s subsidiary in finland 
the company does not currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the company does maintain cash balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar  the company believes that the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would not decline by a material amount
