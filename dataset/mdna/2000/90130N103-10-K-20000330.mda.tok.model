impact of year on computer systems the yk issue arose because some computer programs and hardware were designed to use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company took what it believed to be a comprehensive approach to remediating its yk issues  including the preparation of risk assessments  system upgrades  system replacements  system testing and contingency planning
