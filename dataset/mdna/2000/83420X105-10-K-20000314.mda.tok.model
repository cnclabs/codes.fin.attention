overview we are a leader in the development and application of novel technologies for the discovery of gene expression patterns and genomic variations important to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural industries 
these technologies are based on megaclone  our unique and proprietary cloning procedure  which transforms a sample containing millions of dna molecules into one made up of millions of micro beads  each of which carries approximately  copies of one of the dna molecules in the sample 
based on megaclone  we have developed a suite of applications that have the potential to enhance the pace  scale and quality of genomics and genetics research programs 
currently  our principal collaborators and customers are basf  dupont  aventis cropscience and oxagen 
we have incurred net losses each year since our inception in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect these losses to continue for at least the next several years 
the size of these losses will depend  in part  on the rate of growth  if any  in our revenues and on the level of our expenses 
revenues from technology access fees are from upfront payments from our collaborators and customers who are provided access to our technologies for specified periods 
we receive service fees from our collaborators and customers for genomic discovery services performed by us on the biological samples they send to us 
collaborative research revenues are payments received under various agreements and include such items as milestone payments 
other revenues include the proceeds from the sale of our technology assets to basf lynx and product sales under one of our former programs 
technology access fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the noncancelable term of the agreement to which they relate 
payments for services and or materials provided by us are recognized as revenues when earned over the period in which the services are performed and or materials are delivered  provided no other obligations  refunds  or credits to be applied to future work exist 
milestone payments are recognized as revenues upon the achievement of the related milestone and the satisfaction of any related obligations 
revenues from the sales of products  which have been immaterial to date  are recognized upon shipment to the customer 
to date  we have received  and expect to continue to receive in the future  a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of collaborators and customers 
during  revenues from three collaborators and customers accounted for  and of total revenues 
during  revenues from three collaborators and customers accounted for  and of total revenues 
during  revenues from three collaborators and customers accounted for   and of total revenues 
revenues in each quarterly and annual period have in the past  and could in the future  fluctuate due to the timing and amount of any technology access fee and the period over which the revenue is recognized  the level of service fees  which is tied to the number and timing of biological samples received from our collaborators and customers  as well as our performance of the related genomic discovery services on the samples  the timing of achievement of milestones and the amount of related payments to us  and the initiation of new  and the termination of existing  agreements with collaborators and customers 
cost of services fees include the costs of direct labor  materials and supplies  outside expenses  equipment and overhead incurred by us in performing our genomic discovery services for our collaborators and customers 
research and development expenses include the costs of personnel  materials and supplies  outside expenses  equipment and overhead incurred by us in our technology and application development efforts 
we expect research and development expenses to increase substantially due to planned spending for ongoing technology development and implementation  as well as new applications 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of personnel  materials and supplies  outside expenses  equipment and overhead incurred by us primarily in our administrative  business development  legal and investor relations activities 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in support of our research and development  commercial and business development efforts 
we account for our investment in basf lynx on the equity method  however such investment has a carrying value of zero in the financial statements 
as we have no obligation to fund the operations of basf lynx  we have not recognized our share of basf lynx s losses in the accompanying statements of operations 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues we had total revenues of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  revenues for included technology access fees and service fees of million from dupont  aventis cropscience and basf and collaborative research revenue from a million milestone fee earned under the dupont agreement 
revenues for included technology access fees of million from basf and dupont and million from the acquisition by basf lynx of our technology assets for certain central nervous system  or cns  disorders 
operating costs and expenses our total operating costs and expenses were million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  cost of services fees were million in and reflect the costs of providing our genomic discovery services  which commenced in research and development expenses were million in and million in the increase in research and development expenses in  as compared to  is due primarily to a higher number of personnel  facilities expansion and for activities incurred as we prepared to launch our commercial operations 
our efforts in focused on initiating production for the commercial application of our genomics technologies and completing the scientific experimentation that led to the successful achievement of certain technology milestones and achievements under our agreements 
we expect research and development expenses to increase substantially due to planned spending for ongoing technology development and implementation  as well as new applications 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher personnel related expenses  outside legal and administrative costs associated with our business development efforts and facilities expansion 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in support of our research and development  commercial and business development efforts 
interest and other income net interest income decreased to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   primarily due to lower average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances during  as compared to  and interest expense incurred on debt outstanding in other income was million in the year ended december   and million in the year ended december  in  other income was attributable to a gain on the sale of certain fixed assets no longer used in our operations 
in  other income was due primarily to the gain from the sale of the assets associated with our antisense program to inex pharmaceuticals corporation 
income taxes the provision for income taxes of approximately  for and  for consisted entirely of alternative minimum tax 
as of december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which will expire at various dates from through  if not utilized 
as of december   we also had federal and california research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and  respectively  which will expire at various dates from through  if not utilized 
utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
utilization of federal and california net operating losses and credit carryforwards incurred prior to february is limited on an annual basis under the internal revenue code of  as amended  as a result of an ownership change in years ended december  and revenues we had total revenues of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  revenues for included technology access fees of million from basf and dupont and revenues of million from the acquisition by basf lynx of our technology assets for certain cns disorders 
revenues for included million in technology access fees earned under agreements with basf and aventis pharmaceuticals inc in  revenues also included approximately million in sales of an antisense compound for use in clinical trials under one of our former programs 
operating costs and expenses total operating costs and expenses were million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  research and development expenses were million in and million in the decrease in expenses was due primarily to lower spending subsequent to the sale of assets associated with our antisense program in march and the phase out of scientific efforts related to cns disorders 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to outside legal and administrative costs associated with our business development efforts and facilities expansion 
interest and other income interest income increased to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   due primarily to higher average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances during as compared to other income was million in the amount was due primarily to the gain from the sale of assets associated with our antisense program 
there was no other income earned in income taxes the provision for income taxes of approximately  for consisted entirely of alternative minimum tax 
due to operating losses and the inability to recognize an income tax benefit  there was no provision for income taxes for liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december   increased from million for the same period in this increase was primarily due to the increase in deferred revenues from payments received from collaborators in  which was partially offset by the recognition in of a portion of previously deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances 
net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december   was primarily due to a net loss of million  and a reduction in deferred revenues  offset in part by depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and leasehold improvements 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december   was primarily due to purchases of short term investments and equipment  while net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december   was primarily due to maturities of short term investments  offset in part by expenditures for leasehold improvements and purchases of equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities in of million resulted primarily from borrowings under an equipment loan arrangement 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in the year ended december   and million in the year ended december   resulted from the issuance of common stock 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  in late  we entered into a million financing agreement with a financial institution under which we drew down million during for the purchase of equipment and certain other capital expenditures 
we granted the lender a security interest in all items financed by it under this agreement 
each draw down under the loan has a term of forty eight months from the date of the draw down 
as of december   the principal balance under loans outstanding under this agreement was approximately million 
the amount available for future draw downs at december   was approximately million 
the draw down period under the agreement expires on march  we plan to use available funds for ongoing commercial and research and development activities  working capital and other general corporate purposes and capital expenditures 
we expect capital investments during will be comprised primarily of equipment purchases required in the normal course of business and expenditures for leasehold improvements 
we intend to invest our excess cash in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
we have obtained funding for our operations primarily through sales of preferred and common stock to venture capital investors  institutional investors and collaborators  revenues from contractual arrangements and interest income 
the cost  timing and amount of funds required for specific uses by us cannot be precisely determined at this time and will be based upon the progress and the scope of our collaborative and independent research and development projects  payments received under collaborative agreements  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative agreements  costs included in protecting intellectual property rights  legal and administrative costs  additional facilities capacity needs and the availability of alternate methods of financing 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing research and development expenses and intend to seek additional financing  as needed  through arrangements with collaborators and equity or debt offerings 
we cannot assure you that any additional financing we require will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
we believe  at current spending levels  our existing capital resources and interest income thereon  will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations through at least the next months 
impact of year in prior years  we have discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
we have experienced no significant disruptions in information technology and non information technology systems and believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
costs associated with remediating our systems were immaterial 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters which may arise are addressed promptly 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas sfas requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through net income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in the other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of the derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year ending december  we do not currently hold any derivatives and do not expect this pronouncement to materially impact the results of operations 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab sab summarizes certain areas of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue in financial statements and specifically addresses revenue recogni tion for non refundable technology access fees 
we believe that our current revenue recognition principles comply with sab  and thus the adoption had no effect on results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosures short term investments the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while  at the same time  maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of less than one year 
as a result  we do not believe we are subject to significant interest rate risk 
foreign currency rate fluctuations the functional currency for our german subsidiary is the deutsche mark 
our german subsidiary s accounts are translated from the german deutsche mark to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period  for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  and to date  have not been material 
our german subsidiary conducts its business in local european currencies 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our german subsidiary or transactions with our european collaborators and customers
