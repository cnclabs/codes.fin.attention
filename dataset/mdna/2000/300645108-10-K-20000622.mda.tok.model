the company s primary customers are large communications oems 
over the past several years  the company has actively refocused its business on products for the communications markets 
in the s  the company designed  manufactured and marketed custom and general purpose analog circuits supporting many different applications 
in the s  the company transitioned its products to analog and mixed signal application specific standard products  or assps  focusing on telecommunications  data communications  computer peripherals and consumer electronics 
through the mid s  the company continued this product transition through internal development and strategic acquisitions and moved to a fabless semiconductor business model 
in  the company chose to focus its product strategy and development efforts on the communications markets 
for that year  the company s communications products represented of its net sales 
for the year ended march   the company s communications product sales increased to of its net sales 
the company s international sales represented  and of the company s net sales for the years ended march   and these international sales consist of sales from the united states to overseas customers and sales by its wholly owned subsidiary in japan 
sales by the company s japanese subsidiary are denominated in yen  while all other international sales are denominated in united states dollars 
the company s international operations give rise to exposures from changes in currency exchange rates 
the company has adopted a set of practices to minimize its foreign currency risk which include the occasional use of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge amounts receivable from its foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  foreign sales may be subject to tariffs in certain countries or with regard to certain products  however  the company s profit margin on international sales of ics  adjusted for differences in product mix  is not significantly different from that realized on its sales to domestic customers 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of products when shipped 
the company s distributor agreements generally permit the return of up to of their purchases annually for purposes of stock rotation and also provide for credits to distributors in the event the company reduces the price of any product 
the company records an allowance based on future authorized and historical patterns of returns  price protection and other concessions at the time revenue is recognized

the table and subsequent discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
fiscal years ended march  communications video and imaging other fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily due to a or million increase in sales of the company s communications products 
this increase in communications product sales was fueled by increased sales of the company s serial communications products and increased sales of its data transmission products as both of these product lines gained market acceptance and design wins 
this increase was offset by decreases in sales of discontinued consumer and custom products in the company s legacy product lines due in part to the fiscal closure of one of the company s third party wafer fabrication facilities  as well as the sale of the company s silicon microstructures business unit and related product lines in november in the fiscal year ended march   sales to domestic customers increased by to million 
international sales decreased by to million 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to approximately  compared to for the fiscal year ended march  the resulting increase in gross margins is due primarily to a greater mix of communications products  which generally have higher gross margins than many of the company s more mature products 
gross margins from sales of ics vary depending on product mix  competition from other manufacturers  the volume of products manufactured and sold  the ability of the company s suppliers to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and the cost of materials procured from the company s suppliers 
margins on any particular product generally erode over time 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended march  represented of net sales  compared to of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  research and development spending for the fiscal year ended march  increased by as the company continued to invest in the development of its communications products

the company expects research and development expenses to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales as a result of the timing of expenditures and changes in the level of net sales 
however  the company intends to continue spending approximately of net sales on research and development activities to support its growth 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  represented of net sales  compared to for the fiscal year ended march  selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  increased by 
the increase was due to growth in communications product sales and an increase in employee compensation and benefits expenses associated with a pre tax gain recognized in other income in the first quarter of fiscal in the short term  many of the selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed  causing a decline as a percentage of net sales in periods of rapidly rising sales and an increase as a percentage of net sales when sales growth is slower or declining 
other income

the company sold this stock during the first and fourth quarters of fiscal  resulting in a pre tax gain of million in other income and a related employee compensation and benefits expense of million in costs and expenses 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes is based on income from operations 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately compared with the federal statutory rate of 
the difference is due to utilization of capital loss carryforwards that offset the gain on sale of the ic works investment and tax savings generated from utilization of the company s foreign sales corporation partially offset by non deductible expenses  state income taxes and foreign income  which is taxed at rates different from us income tax

this decrease was primarily due to decreases in net sales of discontinued consumer and custom products in the company s legacy product lines  as well as the sale of the company s silicon microstructures business unit and related product lines 
the abrupt closure of one of the company s third party wafer fabrication facilities during the third quarter of fiscal had a further negative impact of million on its fiscal net sales from legacy products 
in fiscal  sales to domestic customers decreased by to million 
international sales decreased by to million 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the resulting increase in gross margins is due primarily to a greater mix of the company s newer analog and mixed signal products which generally have higher gross margins than its more mature products 
research and development 
research and development expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal research and development expenses decreased by million or compared to fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses is attributable to the company s control of operating expenses in response to decreased sales  to lower employee benefits costs and to the restructuring activities associated with the sale of the company s silicon microstructures business unit and related product lines 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased by million or compared to fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is attributable to decreased commissions expense  to lower employee benefits costs and to the company s control of operating expenses in response to decreased sales

restructuring and other charges in fiscal of  relate to the sale of the company s silicon microstructures business unit and related product lines to osi systems  inc in the third quarter and represent the loss on the sale of assets  severance costs related to the termination of employees and other disposition related expenses 
the restructuring action was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal and was financed with cash 
in addition to the million in proceeds from the sale of the silicon microstructures business unit and related product lines  the company may receive additional contingent performance based payments from this sale of up to million over the next year 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company sold the capital assets that it had written down in fiscal in connection with the termination of a foundry arrangement 
the sales proceeds exceeded the carrying value and  as a result  the company reversed million of the related reserve during the quarter

 june  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative goodwill amortization restructuring and other charges operating income loss other income  net income before income taxes income taxes net income since september   gross margins have increased each quarter primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes  efficiencies gained as a result of the company s decision  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  to transfer its test and shipping operations to foreign subcontractors to reduce manufacturing expenses  and a greater mix of communications products which generally have higher gross margins than the company s more mature products 
the sequential quarter decrease in net sales for the three quarters ended march  was primarily due to decreases in sales of discontinued consumer and custom products in the company s legacy product lines due in part to the fiscal closure of one of its third party wafer fabrication facilities  as well as the sale of the company s silicon microstructures business unit and related product lines in november research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses increased in the quarter ended june  primarily due to million in employee compensation and benefits expenses resulting from a million first quarter pre tax gain on the sale of an investment related to a minority equity investment in ic works included in other income 
in april  the company received in excess of million shares of common stock in cypress semiconductor in exchange for its investment in ic works due to the merger of cypress semiconductor and ic works 
the company sold this stock during the first and fourth quarters of fiscal  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company financed its operations primarily from cash flows from operations and existing cash and short term investments 
at march   the company had million of cash and short term investments 
the company has a short term  unsecured line of credit available under which it may borrow up to million  none of which was being utilized at march  in addition  the company has a credit facility with certain domestic and foreign banks under which it may execute up to million in foreign currency transactions 
at march   the company had no foreign currency contracts outstanding 
for the fiscal year ended march   the company generated million of cash from its operating activities  the result of net income of million and a net increase in working capital of million  partially offset by million of gains on sales of an investment and equipment and non cash items of  net capital and other asset expenditures during the fiscal year ended march  totaled million including purchases of computer equipment and software used for product development 
other investing activities during the fiscal year ended march  included the net purchases of million of short term investments  which was offset by million of proceeds from the sale of the company s minority equity investment in ic works  and  of proceeds from the sale of equipment 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company issued  shares of common stock through a follow on offering for net proceeds of million  repurchased  shares of the company s common stock for million and received million from the issuance of  common stock shares upon the exercise of stock options under the company s stock option plans 
the company has no material firm capital commitments 
the company anticipates that it will continue to finance its operations with cash flows from operations  existing cash and short term investment balances  borrowings under existing bank credit lines  and some combination of long term debt and or lease financing and additional sales of equity securities 
the combination and sources of capital will be determined by management based on the company s needs and prevailing market conditions 
the company believes that cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  borrowings from the line of credit and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy working capital requirements and capital equipment needs for at least the next twelve months 
from time to time  the company evaluates potential acquisitions and equity investments complementary to its design expertise and market strategy  including investments in  or other arrangements with  wafer fabrication foundries 
to the extent the company pursues these transactions  it could be required to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt could result in dilution to the company s stockholders 
year many computer systems may experience problems interpreting dates around the year the company has completed the process of identifying the programs and infrastructure in all areas that could be affected by the year issue and has developed an implementation plan to resolve any issues 
as of the date of this filing  the company has experienced no significant problems related to year issues 
in  the company implemented a new business system that is year compliant at a cost of million 
in addition  the replacement of the company s remaining legacy systems is estimated to cost  the amount capitalized for the acquisition and implementation of the new business system and the replacement of the remaining legacy systems was million 
the company has expensed approximately  of project costs in prior periods 
the new business system implementation was substantially complete as of march   and the capitalized portion is being depreciated over an average of six years 
the company believes that it will continue to be able to operate its time sensitive business application software programs and infrastructure 
however  due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company continues to work with key suppliers and customers to assess their year readiness 
the failure by a third party to adequately address the year issue could harm the party s ability to furnish products and services to the company and  therefore  could harm its business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency fluctuations 
the company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily through its operations in japan 
this exposure is the result of timing differences between incoming and outgoing cashflows denominated in foreign currency 
operational currency requirements are typically forecast for a three month period 
if there is a need to hedge this risk  the company will enter into transactions to purchase or sell currency in the open market or enter into forward currency exchange contracts which are currently available under its bank lines of credit 
while it is expected that this method of hedging foreign currency risk will be utilized in the future  the hedging methodology and or usage may be changed to manage exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
if the company s foreign operations forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  the company could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
at the end of fiscal  the company did not have significant foreign currency denominated net assets or net liabilities positions and had no foreign currency contracts outstanding 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturity dates with various banks and investment banking institutions 
the company does not regularly hold investments with maturity dates beyond days 
the market value of these investments on any day during the investment term may vary as a result of market interest rate fluctuations 
this exposure is not hedged because a hypothetical movement in interest rates during the investment term would not likely have a material impact on investment income 
the actual impact on investment income in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on actual balances and changes in the timing and the amount of interest rate movements 
the short term investments are classified as available for sale securities and the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
this designation is reevaluated as of each balance sheet date 
at march   short term investments consisted of auction rate securities of million 
as of march   there were no significant differences between the fair market value and the underlying cost of such investments
