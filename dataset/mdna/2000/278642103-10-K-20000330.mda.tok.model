item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ebay pioneered online personal trading by developing a web based community in which buyers and sellers are brought together in an efficient and entertaining format to buy and sell almost anything 
the ebay service permits sellers to list items for sale  buyers to bid on items of interest and all ebay users to browse through listed items in a fully automated  topically arranged  intuitive and easy to use online service that is available seven days a week 
the company has extended its online offerings to include regional and international trading  autos  premium priced items and has acquired billpoint  a provider of online billing and payment solutions 
during ebay also expanded into the traditional auction business with its acquisitions of butterfield butterfield and kruse international 
substantially all of the company s revenues come from fees and commissions associated with online and offline trading services 
online revenue is derived from placement and success fees paid by sellers as ebay does not charge fees to buyers 
sellers pay a nominal placement fee and by paying additional fees  sellers can have items featured in various ways 
sellers also pay a success fee based on the final purchase price 
to date  online advertising on the ebay website and online payment solutions provided by billpoint have not made significant contributions to net revenues although the company expects both of these sources of revenue to increase in the future 
offline revenue is derived from a variety of sources including sellers commissions  buyers premiums  bidder registration fees  and auction related services including appraisal and authentication 
ebay expects that the online business  including the billpoint service  will continue to drive the majority of revenue growth in the foreseeable future

the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain data from ebay s consolidated statement of income as a percentage of net revenues 
this information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
year ended december  net revenues cost of net revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing product development general and administrative amortization of acquired intangibles merger related costs total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net income before income taxes 
provision for income taxes 
net income it is difficult for the company to forecast its revenues or earnings accurately and the operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
although accurate revenue forecasts are difficult  the company has begun to recognize the seasonal nature of its business 
in particular  the company has noted stronger sequential quarterly online revenue growth between the fourth quarter and the first quarter  and a lower  relatively level growth rate throughout the remainder of the year 
within offline auction operations  b b typically experiences its strongest revenue growth in the second and fourth quarters  while kruse international experiences its strongest revenue growth in the third quarter 
due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting net revenues  it is also difficult to forecast income statement expense categories as a percentage of net revenues 
quarterly and annual income statement expense categories as a percentage of net revenues may be significantly different from historical or projected rates 
in general  the company expects costs to increase in absolute dollars across all income statement categories 
as more users come to the site for practical and one time items like computers and automobiles  the company expects that the number of transactions per registered user will continue to decline 
further  the company expects its gross margin to remain at levels lower than those experienced historically due primarily to the effects of depreciation from recently purchased and expected future purchases of site equipment and software  increases in site operations personnel and consulting costs  and growth within the customer support organization 
although the operations and results of both b b and kruse show seasonal trends in net revenues and expenses  annual results of operations are relatively stable when compared to the online business 
these trends may not be indicative of future results as the company leverages the acquired companies expertise and expands into premium online sales and online automobile sales 
to a large extent  the changes in the consolidated results of operations for the periods presented are due to the growth of the online business  thus discussions about year over year changes will primarily focus on the online operation 
net revenues the company derives revenue from a variety of sources including listing  success  and featured item fees for transactions occurring online  and transaction related fees  commissions and rental income in traditional auction operations 
neither billpoint nor alando had significant operations prior to  and no significant revenue was generated from either company in the company s net revenues increased from million to million in the years ended december  and  and further increased to million in the year ended december  the increases from to and from to were almost solely the result of increased use of the ebay site 
net revenues in the acquired companies remaining comparable with prior periods 
increases in online net revenues were a result of the growth of the ebay site  which is reflected in the growth in the number of registered users  listings  and gross merchandise sales 
the company expects that future revenue growth will be largely driven by the online services  including revenue derived from the billpoint services 
the company has reviewed securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and its effect on the recognition of listing and featured item fee revenue 
although the company believes the effect of sab on historical listing and featured item fee revenue is insignificant  ebay has adopted the provision for placement fee revenue in the first quarter of as such  listing and featured item fee revenue will be recognized ratably over the estimated period of the listing for sale 
cost of net revenues cost of net revenues for online operations consists primarily of costs associated with customer support and site operations 
these costs include compensation and allocated overhead for customer support and site operations personnel  isp connectivity charges and depreciation 
cost of net revenues in traditional auction operations primarily includes compensation for auction  appraisal  and customer support personnel and direct auction costs  such as event site rental 
cost of net revenues increased in absolute dollars from million or of net revenues in to million or of net revenues in  and further increased to million or of net revenues in the increases from to and from to were due almost entirely to the ebay online business  including the operations of alando and billpoint in changes in offline cost of net revenues roughly paralleled the changes in net revenues during the periods reported 
increases in absolute dollar expenditures for the ebay online service during the periods from to  and from to resulted from the continued development and expansion of the company s customer support and site operations departments  depreciation of the equipment required for the company s site operations  software licensing fees and isp connectivity charges 
cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues is expected to remain at levels higher than those seen historically as the company continues to invest in its site infrastructure in advance of demand  depreciates recently purchased equipment  and continues to grow its customer support function 
sales and marketing the company s sales and marketing expenses for both the online sales and traditional auction businesses are comprised primarily of compensation for the company s sales and marketing personnel  advertising  tradeshow and other promotional costs  expenses for creative design of the company s website and shared employee and facilities costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars from million or of net revenues in to million or of net revenues in  and further increased to million or of net revenues in during the periods from to  and from to  increases in marketing expenditures were primarily driven by the online business 
the increase from to primarily resulted from substantial increases in advertising and promotional expenses  including costs associated with national print  broadcast and online advertising campaigns and expenses associated with a marketing agreement with aol  each of which commenced in the second half of  in addition to the continued growth in the number of sales and marketing personnel 
increases from to were primarily the result of increases in online advertising and distribution  including expenses associated with the marketing agreement with aol  labor related costs  costs associated with the use of outside services and consultants  and miscellaneous user and promotional costs 
online sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in  due to a full year of advertising impressions delivered under the strategic alliance with aol  new alliances including agreement with go 
com and autotrader 
com  the expansion of international advertising and expenses associated with personnel additions made during sales and marketing expenses in the traditional auction businesses are expected to remain comparable with historical levels 
product development the company s product development expenses consist primarily of compensation for the company s product development staff  payments to outside contractors  depreciation on equipment used for development and shared employee and facilities costs 
the company s product development expenses increased in absolute dollars from  or of net revenues in to million or of net revenues in  and further increased to million or of net revenues in the year over year changes  and all expenditures discussed  were incurred by the online business 
neither b b nor kruse had any product development costs through december  the increase in absolute dollars during the periods from to  and from to resulted primarily from increases in salaries  benefits and other personnel related costs as the company significantly increased the size of its research and development staff  as well as expenses related to contractors and consultants employed within product development departments 
the increase also includes billpoint  which had no significant expenses in product development expenses are expected to increase in future periods primarily from personnel additions  the continued impact of billpoint product development  and additional depreciation costs as the company continues to purchase equipment to improve and expand its operations both domestically and internationally 
these future expenditures will be capitalized or expensed as appropriate 
hardware and software expenditures associated with the continuous revision of the site will be capitalized and included in computer equipment and software 
expenditures that are incurred for maintenance related costs or have been judged to have a useful life of less than one year will be expensed as incurred 
general and administrative the company s general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for personnel and  to a lesser extent  fees for external professional advisors  provisions for doubtful accounts and shared employee and facilities costs 
the company s general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars from million or of net revenues in to million or of net revenues in  and further increased to million or of net revenues in during the periods from to  and from to  increases in general and administrative expenses were primarily driven by the online business 
the increase in expenses from to primarily resulted from several stock related transactions occurring in these include the company s contribution in june of  shares of common stock with an estimated fair value of million to a charitable foundation  compensation expense of  associated with the purchase of restricted shares of common stock by the company s outside directors and compensation expense of approximately million associated with stock options granted to employees 
additional year over year increases resulted from increases in personnel related expenses  the allowance for doubtful accounts  fees for professional services and overhead costs 
increases from to resulted primarily from additional personnel related expenses  including those associated with the safeharbora program  fees for professional services  public company expenses including various sec filing fees and allocations of overhead 
the company expects that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of net revenues in future periods as ebay s online business becomes a progressively larger piece of the consolidated business 
such expenses in the online business are typically lower as a percentage of net revenues than those in the traditional auction business 
amortization of acquired intangibles during  ebay recognized expenses totaling  related to the acquisition of jump inc jump 
the majority of the jump acquired intangibles were fully amortized during  with the remaining amortization continuing through the third quarter of other acquisition related intangibles will be amortized at varying rates through from time to time the company has purchased  and expects to continue purchasing  assets or businesses in order to maintain its leadership role in online personal trading 
these purchases may result in the creation of intangible assets and lead to a corresponding increase in the amortization of acquired intangibles 
merger related costs during the year ended december   the company incurred direct merger related transaction costs of million which were charged to operations 
there were no comparable expenses in the same periods of or as opportunities present themselves  the company may continue to acquire new companies  such acquisitions could lead to additional direct and indirect expenses which would negatively affect the company s results of operations 
interest and other income expense  net the company s interest and other income expense  net  consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments offset by interest expense  minority interests in consolidated companies  and income or loss in partnership equity 
interest expense is primarily derived from interest payments on building mortgages held by b b 
the company s interest and other income expense  net declined from million or of net revenues in to  or of net revenues in and became a gain of million or in from to  ebay s online business was the primary contributor to interest income from interest earned on the net proceeds from the company s initial public offering in september and  to a lesser extent  interest earned on proceeds from the exercise of warrants in may those gains were offset primarily by interest expense incurred on mortgages held by b b 
the gain in was primarily the result of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and investments  particularly the interest earned on the net proceeds of the company s follow on offering completed in april interest expense was approximately comparable between   and the company expects interest and other income expense  net to remain positive in due to the continued interest earned on the proceeds from the follow on offering 
provision for income taxes the company s effective federal and state income tax rate was  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
prior to its acquisition in  b b had been taxed as an s corporation 
in connection with its acquisition  b b s status as an s corporation was terminated  and b b became subject to federal and state income taxes 
the supplemental pro forma financial information presented in the financial statements includes an increase to the provisions for income taxes based upon a combined federal and state tax rate 
this rate approximates the statutory tax rate which would have been applied if b b had been taxed as a c corporation prior to its acquisition by ebay 
the rate changes from to and from to both resulted from two primary factors  a larger portion of the revenue in each year was generated by ebay  a c corporation  and certain non cash  non deductible expenses as a percentage of pre tax income 
the company expects the consolidated effective tax rate to be at or near during stock based compensation in connection with the grant of certain stock options and warrants from may through may  the company recorded aggregate unearned compensation totaling million  which is being amortized over the four year vesting period of the options and the one year term of the warrant  respectively 
of the total unearned compensation  approximately  million and million was amortized in  and respectively 
the company expects stock based compensation expense of approximately million in the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has financed its operations primarily from net cash generated from operating activities 
the company has obtained additional financing from the sale of preferred stock and warrants  proceeds from the exercise of those warrants  proceeds from the exercise of stock options  and proceeds from its initial and follow on public offerings 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from the company s net income before non cash charges for amortization of unearned compensation  the provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization  as well as increases in various liabilities  offset by partnership losses and changes in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  million in  and million in purchases of investments  property  equipment and intangibles was the primary use for invested cash in all years presented  partially offset in by the sale of property and equipment 
during and  proceeds from public offerings were used to purchase million and million of investments  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in  million in and million in during  and  the company made distributions to b b stockholders  but those amounts were offset by debt and equity proceeds 
the company remained cash flow positive from financing activities primarily due to the completion of its initial public offering in september and its follow on offering in april to a lesser extent  financing activities included the exercise of preferred stock warrants in and b b stockholders contributions during  and ebay had no material commitments for capital expenditures at december   but expects such expenditures to be at least million through december  such expenditures will primarily be for computer equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements 
ebay also has total minimum lease obligations of million under certain noncancellable operating leases and notes payable obligations of million through december in march  ebay and aol expanded the scope of their strategic relationship 
under this new agreement  ebay will pay aol million over the four year term of the contract 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  and any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating activities  capital expenditures and other obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  if during that period or thereafter the company is not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to the company  the company s business could suffer 
year the company reviewed and tested its internal programs and those of its newly acquired businesses and determined that there were no significant year issues within its or their mission critical systems or services 
during the company s review of third party software  the company and its subsidiaries identified certain software patches for third party software that needed to be implemented for year compliance 
all of these patches were implemented prior to january  total out of pocket costs associated with yk remediation efforts were less than million 
although the company has not experienced any significant year problems in its own software or third party systems  it is possible that such problems still exist 
if so  the company could face unexpected expenses to fix such problems or suffer unexpected outages  either of which would harm its business 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business could be harmed 
we have a limited operating history our company was formed as a sole proprietorship in september and we incorporated in may we have only a limited operating history on which you can base an evaluation of our business and prospects 
as an online commerce company in the early stage of development  we face substantial risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties 
you should consider an investment in our company in light of these risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties 
to address these risks and uncertainties  we must do the following 
maintain and increase our number of registered users  items listed on our service and completed sales  
expand into new markets  
maintain and grow our website and customer support operations at a reasonable cost  
continue to make trading through our service safer for users  
maintain and enhance our brand  
successfully execute our business and marketing strategy  
continue to develop and upgrade our technology and information processing systems  
continue to enhance our service to meet the needs of a changing market  
provide superior customer service  
respond to competitive developments  and 
attract  integrate  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we may be unable to accomplish one or more of these goals  which could cause our business to suffer 
in addition  accomplishing one or more of these goals might be very expensive  which could harm our financial results 
our operating results may fluctuate our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during our short operating history 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following 
our ability to retain an active user base  to attract new users who list items for sale and who purchase items through our service and to maintain customer satisfaction  
our ability to keep our website operational and to manage the number of items listed on our service  
the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business  operations and infrastructure  
federal  state or local government regulation  including investigations prompted by items improperly listed or sold by our users  
the introduction of new sites  services and products by us or our competitors  
volume  size  timing and completion rate of trades on our website  
consumer confidence in the security of transactions on our website  
our ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure to accommodate growth  
technical difficulties or service interruptions  
our ability to attract new personnel in a timely and effective manner  
our ability to retain key employees in both our online businesses and our new acquisitions  
the ability of our land based auction businesses to acquire high quality properties for auction  
the timing  cost and availability of advertising in traditional media and on other websites and online services  
the timing of marketing expenses under existing contracts  
consumer trends and popularity of some categories of collectible items  
the success of our brand building and marketing campaigns  
the level of use of the internet and online services  
increasing consumer acceptance of the internet and other online services for commerce and  in particular  the trading of products such as those listed on our website  and 
general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the internet and electronic commerce industries 
our limited operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete make it difficult for us to forecast our revenues or earnings accurately 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 
we do not have backlog  and almost all of our net revenues each quarter come from items that are listed and completed during that quarter 
our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline 
our failure to manage growth could harm us we currently are experiencing a period of significant expansion in our headcount  facilities and infrastructure and we anticipate that further expansion will be required to address potential growth in our customer base and market opportunities 
this expansion has placed  and we expect it will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
the areas that are put under severe strain by our rate of growth include the following 
the website 
we must constantly add new hardware  update software and add new engineering personnel to accommodate the increased use of our website 
this has reduced our margins 
if we are unable to increase the capacity of our systems at least as fast as the growth in demand for this capacity  our website may become unstable and may cease to operate for periods of time 
we have experienced periodic unscheduled downtime 
continued unscheduled downtime could harm our business and also could anger users of our website and reduce future revenues 

customer support 
we must expand our customer support operations to accommodate the increased number of users and transactions on our website 
if we are unable to hire and successfully train sufficient employees or contractors in this area  users of our website may have negative experiences and current and future revenues could suffer 

customer accounts 
our revenues are dependent on prompt and accurate billing processes 
if we are unable to grow our transaction processing abilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed  our ability to collect revenue will be harmed 
we must continue to hire  train and manage new employees at a rapid rate 
the majority of our employees today have been with us less than one year and we expect that our rate of hiring will continue at a very high pace 
if our new hires are not good hires  or if we are unsuccessful in training and integrating these new employees  our business may be harmed 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel  we will need to improve our transaction processing  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
we may be unable to hire  train  retain and manage required personnel or to identify and take advantage of existing and potential strategic relationships and market opportunities 
we may not maintain profitability we believe that our continued profitability will depend in large part on our ability to do the following 
maintain sufficient transaction volume to attract buyers and sellers  
manage the costs of our business  including the costs associated with maintaining and developing our website  customer support and international expansion  
increase our brand name awareness  and 
provide our customers with superior community and trading experiences 
we are investing heavily in marketing and promotion  customer support  further development of our website  technology and operating infrastructure development 
the costs of these investments have reduced our margins and are expected to remain significant into the future 
in addition  we have significant ongoing commitments in some of these areas 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust our spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  which may harm our profitability 
the existence of several larger and more established companies that are rapidly enabling online sales as well as new companies  many of whom do not charge for transactions on their sites and others who are facilitating trading through other pricing formats fixed price  reverse auction  group buying  etc 
limits our ability to raise user fees in response to declines in profitability 
in addition  we are spending in advance of anticipated growth  which may also harm our profitability 
our historic growth rates are not sustainable and we expect in the near term that our costs  particularly those related to site operations  customer support  payments  other infrastructure and our international  regional and premium initiatives  will continue to increase 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely upon our historical results as indications of our future performance 
acquisitions could result in dilution  operating difficulties and other harmful consequences if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we intend to acquire businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are strategic 
in we completed the four acquisitions described earlier in this document as well as several smaller acquisitions 
the process of integrating any acquisition may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky 
the areas where we may face difficulties include 
diversion of management time at both companies during the period of negotiation through closing and further diversion of such time after closing from focus on operating the businesses to issues of integration and future products  
decline in employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects  or the direction of the business  
the need to integrate each company s accounting  management information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented  and 
the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had been smaller  private companies 
prior to the acquisitions we had almost no experience in managing this integration process 
most of our acquisitions to date have involved either family run companies or very early stage companies  which may worsen these integration issues 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any or all of these acquisitions may not be realized 
future acquisitions or mergers could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could harm our business 
future acquisitions or mergers may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing  which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
even if available  this financing may be dilutive 
unauthorized break ins or other assaults on our service could harm our business our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays  loss of data or the inability to complete customer transactions 
in addition  unauthorized persons may improperly access our data 
we have experienced an unauthorized break in by a hacker who has stated that he can in the future damage or change our system or take confidential information 
we have also experienced denial of service attacks on our system which made our website unavailable for periods of time 
these and other types of attacks could harm us 
actions of this sort may be very expensive to remedy and could damage our reputation and discourage new and existing users from using our service 
our business may be harmed by the listing or sale by our users of illegal items the law relating to the liability of providers of online services for the activities of their users on their service is currently unsettled 
we are aware that certain goods  such as firearms  other weapons  adult material  tobacco products  alcohol and other goods that may be subject to regulation by local  state or federal authorities  have been listed and traded on our service 
we may be unable to prevent the sale of unlawful goods  or the sale of goods in an unlawful manner  by users of our service  and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our service 
in order to reduce our exposure to this liability  we have prohibited the listing of certain items and increased the number of personnel reviewing questionable items 
we may in the future implement other protective measures that could require us to spend substantial resources and or to reduce revenues by discontinuing certain service offerings 
any costs incurred as a result of liability or asserted liability relating to the sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods  could harm our business 
in addition  we have received significant and continuing media attention relating to the listing or sale of unlawful goods on our website 
this negative publicity could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand name 
it also could make users reluctant to continue to use our services 
our business may be harmed by the listing or sale by our users of pirated items we have received in the past  and we anticipate we will receive in the future  communications alleging that certain items listed or sold through our service by our users infringe third party copyrights  trademarks and tradenames or other intellectual property rights 
although we have actively sought to work with the content community to eliminate infringing listings on our website  some content owners have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient 
an allegation of infringement of third party intellectual property rights may result in litigation against us 
any such litigation could be costly for us  could result in increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement  could require us to change our business practices in expensive ways  or could otherwise harm our business 
see legal proceedings 
our business may be harmed by fraudulent activities on our website our future success will depend largely upon sellers reliably delivering and accurately representing their listed goods and buyers paying the agreed purchase price 
we have received in the past  and anticipate that we will receive in the future  communications from users who did not receive the purchase price or the goods that were to have been exchanged 
while we can suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their delivery obligations to other users  we do not have the ability to require users to make payments or deliver goods or otherwise make users whole other than through our limited insurance program 
other than through this program  we do not compensate users who believe they have been defrauded by other users 
we also periodically receive complaints from buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased 
negative publicity generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our service could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand name 
we expect to continue to receive requests from users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made 
this sort of litigation could be costly for us  divert management attention  result in increased costs of doing business  lead to adverse judgments or could otherwise harm our business 
government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties on january   we received requests to produce certain records and information to the federal government relating to an investigation of possible illegal transactions in connection with our website 
we have been informed that the inquiry includes an examination of our practices with respect to these transactions 
we have provided further information in connection with this ongoing inquiry 
in order to protect the investigation  the court has ordered that no further public disclosures be made with respect to the matter 
on march   b b received a grand jury subpoena from the antitrust division of the department of justice requesting documents relating to  among other things  changes in b b s seller s commissions and buyer s premiums and discussions  agreements or understandings with other auction houses  in each case since we believe this request may be related to a publicly reported criminal investigation of auction houses for price fixing 
should these or any other investigations lead to civil or criminal charges against us  we would likely be harmed by negative publicity  the costs of litigation  the diversion of management time and other negative effects  even if we ultimately prevail 
our business would certainly suffer if we were not to prevail in any action like this 
even the process of providing records and information can be expensive  time consuming and result in the diversion of management attention 
a large number of transactions occur on our website 
as a result  we believe that government regulators have received a substantial number of consumer complaints about us which  while small as a percentage of our total transactions  are large in aggregate numbers 
as a result  we have from time to time been contacted by various federal  state and local regulatory agencies and been told that they have questions with respect to the adequacy of the steps we take to protect our users from fraud 
for example  the city of new york department of consumer affairs received complaints from users about transactions on our website 
in investigating these complaints  the department of consumer affairs requested information about us and these transactions 
we have provided the requested information 
we are likely to receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future  which may lead to action against us 
we have responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies by describing our current and planned antifraud efforts 
if one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries  the resultant investigations and potential fines or other penalties could harm our business 
we have recently provided information to the antitrust division of the department of justice in connection with an inquiry with an inquiry into our conduct with respect to auction aggregators including our licensing program and our lawsuit against bidder s edge 
should the division decide to take action against us  we would likely be harmed by negative publicity  the costs of the action  possible private antitrust lawsuits  the diversion of management time and effort and penalties we might suffer if we ultimately were not to prevail 
some of our businesses are subject to regulation and others may be in the future both b b and kruse are subject to regulation in some jurisdictions governing the manner in which live auctions are conducted 
both are required to obtain licensure in these jurisdictions with respect to their business or to permit the sale of categories of items eg wine  automobiles  real estate 
these licenses generally must be renewed regularly and are subject to revocation for violation of law  violation of the regulations governing auctions in general or the sale of the particular item and other events 
if either company was unable to renew a license or had a license revoked  its business would be harmed 
in addition  changes to the regulations or the licensure requirements could increase the complexity and the cost of doing auctions  thereby harming us 
as our activities and the types of goods listed on our site expand  state regulatory agencies may claim that we are subject to licensure in their jurisdiction 
these claims could result in costly litigation or could require us to change our manner of doing business in ways that increase our costs or reduce our revenues or force us to prohibit listings of certain items 
we could also be subject to fines or other penalties 
any of these outcomes could harm us 
billpoint  our internet payment company  is subject to unique risks billpoint is subject to unique risks as a provider of internet payment solutions 
businesses that handle consumers funds are subject to numerous regulations  including those related to banking  credit cards  escrow  fair credit reporting and others 
billpoint is a new business with a relatively novel approach to facilitating payments 
it is not yet known how regulatory agencies will treat billpoint 
the cost and complexity of billpoint s business may increase if certain regulations are deemed to apply to its business 
in addition to the need to comply with these regulations  billpoint s business is also subject to risks of fraud  the need to grow systems and processes rapidly if its product is well received  a high level of competition  including competitors who are currently not charging for their product offerings  and the need to coordinate systems and policies among itself  us and wells fargo bank  which will be the provider of payment services 
we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our service the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services is currently unsettled 
claims could be made against online services companies under both united states and foreign law for defamation  libel  invasion of privacy  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose liability upon online services companies currently are pending 
in addition  federal  state and foreign legislation has been proposed that imposes liability for or prohibits the transmission over the internet of certain types of information 
our service features a feedback forum  which includes information from users regarding other users 
although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us  it is possible that a claim of defamation or other injury could be made against us for content posted in the feedback forum 
claims like these become more likely and have a higher probability of success in jurisdictions outside the us if we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service  we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability 
this may require us to expend substantial resources and or to discontinue certain service offerings 
in addition  the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business 
we carry liability insurance  but it may not be adequate to fully compensate us if we become liable for information carried on or through our service 
any costs incurred as a result of this liability or asserted liability could harm our business 
we are subject to intellectual property and other litigation on march   we were sued by network engineering software  inc nes in the us district court for the northern district of california for our alleged willful and deliberate violation of a patent 
the suit sought unspecified monetary damages as well as an injunction against our operations 
it also sought treble damages and attorneys fees and costs 
we have entered into a settlement agreement and license with nes  and this suit has been dismissed with prejudice 
on september   we were served with a lawsuit filed by randall stoner  on behalf of the general public  in san francisco superior court no 

the lawsuit alleges that we violated section of the california business professions code  a statute that relates to unfair competition  based upon the listing of bootleg or pirate recordings by our users  allegedly in violation of california penal statutes relating to the sale of unauthorized audio recordings 
the lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief  restitution and legal fees 
discovery has commenced 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to this lawsuit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if successful  this defense could be costly and  if we were to lose this lawsuit  our business could be harmed 
on december   we sued bidder s edge  inc in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging trespass  unfair competition  violation of the computer fraud and abuse act  misappropriation  false advertising  trademark dilution  injury to business reputation  interference with prospective economic advantage  and unjust enrichment 
on february   bidder s edge denied these claims and counterclaimed against us alleging that we have violated the antitrust laws by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize a market  we are competing unfairly  and that we interfered with their contract with ebay magazine 
bidder s edge is seeking treble damages  an injunction and its fees and costs 
expedited discovery in this case has commenced 
we intend to prosecute our claims and defend ourselves against bidder s edge counterclaims vigorously 
however  this lawsuit could be costly and our business could be harmed if we were to lose 
other third parties have from time to time claimed and may claim in the future that we have infringed their past  current or future technologies 
we expect that participants in our markets increasingly will be subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in our industry segment grows 
any claim like this  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause service upgrade delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
as a result  any claim like this could harm our business 
the inability to expand our systems may limit our growth we seek to generate a high volume of traffic and transactions on our service 
the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our website  processing systems and network infrastructure are critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain large numbers of users 
our revenues depend on the number of items listed by users  the volume of user transactions that are successfully completed and the final prices paid for the items listed 
if the volume of traffic on our website or the number of items being listed for sale continues to increase  we will need to expand and upgrade our technology  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure 
we may be unable to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our service or to timely expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate any increases 
we use internally developed systems to operate our service and for transaction processing  including billing and collections processing 
we must continually improve these systems in order to accommodate the level of use of our website 
in addition  we may add new features and functionality to our services that would result in the need to develop or license additional technologies 
we capitalize hardware and software costs associated with this development in accordance with company policy and include such amounts in computer equipment and software 
internal expenses are often judged to have useful lives of less than one year  or have been more appropriately classified as maintenance related costs 
as such  these costs are expensed as incurred 
our inability to add additional software and hardware or to upgrade our technology  transaction processing systems or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume could have adverse consequences 
these consequences include unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  degradation in levels of customer support  impaired quality of the users experience on our service and delays in reporting accurate financial information 
our failure to provide new features or functionality also could result in these consequences 
we may be unable to effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or to integrate smoothly any newly developed or purchased technologies with our existing systems 
these difficulties could harm or limit our ability to expand our business 
system failures could harm our business we have experienced system failures from time to time 
our website has been interrupted for periods of up to hours 
in addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff  these outages create a flood of user questions and complaints that must be responded to by our customer support personnel 
any unscheduled interruption in our service results in an immediate loss of revenues that can be substantial and may cause some users to switch to our competitors 
if we experience frequent or persistent system failures  our reputation and brand could be permanently harmed 
we are currently taking steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our system 
these steps are expensive  reduce our margins and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime 
our ebay germany website is maintained by a third party 
any failure by this party to successfully operate this site could damage our business 
substantially all of our computer hardware for operating our service currently is located at the facilities of exodus communications  inc in santa clara  california and abovenet in san jose  california 
these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures and similar events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
we do not maintain fully redundant systems or alternative providers of hosting services  and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at either the exodus or abovenet facility could result in interruptions in our services 
in addition  the failure by exodus or abovenet to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service 
any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service 
interruptions in our service will reduce our revenues and profits  and our future revenues and profits will be harmed if our users believe that our system is unreliable 
our stock price has been and may continue to be extremely volatile the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be extremely volatile 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following 
actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  
unscheduled system downtime  
additions or departures of key personnel  
announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors  
changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  
conditions or trends in the internet and online commerce industries  
changes in the market valuations of other internet or online service companies  
developments in internet regulation  
announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  
sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market  and 
other events or factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the trading price of internet stocks in general  and ours in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent months 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
the valuations of many internet stocks  including ours  are extraordinarily high based on conventional valuation standards such as price to earnings and price to sales ratios 
the trading price of our common stock has increased enormously from the initial public offering price 
these trading prices and valuations may not be sustained 
any negative change in the public s perception of the prospects of internet or e commerce companies could depress our stock price regardless of our results 
other broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
market fluctuations  as well as general political and economic conditions such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations  also may decrease the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following declines in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation often has been instituted against the company 
litigation of this type  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
new and existing regulations could harm our business we are subject to the same federal  state and local laws as other companies conducting business on the internet 
today there are relatively few laws specifically directed towards online services 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet and online services  many laws relating to the internet are being debated at the state and federal levels and it is possible that laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the internet or online services 
these laws and regulations could cover issues such as online contracts  user privacy  freedom of expression  pricing  fraud  content and quality of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights and information security 
applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel  obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain 
the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
those laws that do reference the internet  such as the recently passed digital millennium copyright act  have not yet been interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain 
in addition  numerous states  including the state of california  where our headquarters are located  have regulations regarding how auctions may be conducted and the liability of auctioneers in conducting such auctions 
no legal determination has been made with respect to the applicability of the california regulations to our business to date and little precedent exists in this area 
several states are considering imposing these regulations upon us or our users  which could harm our business 
in addition  as the nature of the products listed by our users changes  we may become subject to new regulatory restrictions 
several states have proposed legislation that would limit the uses of personal user information gathered online or require online services to establish privacy policies 
the federal trade commission also has recently settled proceedings regarding the manner in which personal information is collected from users and provided to third parties 
changes to existing laws or the passage of new laws intended to address these issues could directly affect the way we do business or could create uncertainty in the marketplace 
this could reduce demand for our services  increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs  or otherwise harm our business 
in addition  because our services are accessible worldwide  and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide  foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws 
as we expand our international activities  we will become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate 
compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings relative to those in the united states 
our failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from fines to bans on our ability to offer our services 
in the united states  companies are required to qualify as foreign corporations in states where they are conducting business 
as an internet company  it is unclear in which states we are actually conducting business 
our failure to qualify as a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where we are required to do so could subject us to taxes and penalties for the failure to qualify and could result in our inability to enforce contracts in those jurisdictions 
any new legislation or regulation  or the application of laws or regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business  could harm our business 
our business has been seasonal our results of operations historically have been somewhat seasonal in nature because many of our users reduce their activities on our website during the thanksgiving and christmas holidays and with the onset of good weather 
both b b and kruse have significant quarter to quarter variations in their results of operations depending on the timing of auctions and the availability of high quality items from large collections and estates 
b b typically has its best operating results in the traditional fall and spring auction seasons and has historically incurred operating losses in the first and third quarters 
kruse typically sees a seasonal peak in operations in the third quarter 
seasonal or cyclical variations in our business may become more pronounced over time and may harm our results of operations in the future 
we are dependent on the continued growth of online commerce the business of selling goods over the internet  particularly through personal trading  is new and dynamic 
our future net revenues and profits will be substantially dependent upon the widespread acceptance of the internet and online services as a medium for commerce by consumers 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet and online services is a recent phenomenon 
this acceptance and use may not continue 
even if the internet is accepted  concerns about fraud  privacy and other problems may mean that a sufficiently broad base of consumers will not adopt the internet as a medium of commerce 
in particular  our website requires users to make publicly available their e mail addresses and other personal information that some potential users may be unwilling to provide 
these concerns may increase as additional publicity over privacy issues on ebay or generally over the internet increase 
market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the internet is highly uncertain  and there are few proven services and products 
in order to expand our user base  we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods 
there are many risks associated with our international operations we are expanding internationally 
we recently acquired alando  a leading online german personal trading platform  and began operations in the united kingdom and  through a joint venture  in australia 
in february  we further expanded into japan 
expansion into international markets will require management attention and resources 
we have limited experience in localizing our service to conform to local cultures  standards and policies 
we may have to compete with local companies who understand the local market better than we do 
we may not be successful in expanding into international markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations 
even if we are successful  the costs of operating internationally are expected to exceed our international net revenues for at least months in most countries 
as we continue to expand internationally  we are subject to risks of doing business internationally  including the following 
regulatory requirements  including regulation of auctions  that may limit or prevent the offering of our services in local jurisdictions  
legal uncertainty regarding liability for the listings of our users  including less internet friendly basic law and unique local laws  
government imposed limitations on the public s access to the internet  
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  
longer payment cycles  different accounting practices and problems in collecting accounts receivable  
cultural nonacceptance of online trading  
higher telecommunications and internet service provider costs  
more stringent consumer protection laws  
seasonal reductions in business activity  and 
potentially adverse tax consequences 
some of these factors may cause our international costs to exceed our domestic costs of doing business 
to the extent we expand our international operations and have additional portions of our international revenues denominated in foreign currencies  we also could become subject to increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our business may be subject to sales and other taxes we do not collect sales or other similar taxes on goods sold by users through our service 
one or more states may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on companies such as ours that engage in or facilitate online commerce 
several proposals have been made at the state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the internet 
these proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of electronic commerce  and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities 
in  the us federal government enacted legislation prohibiting states or other local authorities from imposing new taxes on internet commerce for a period of three years 
this tax moratorium will last only for a limited period and does not prohibit states or the internal revenue service from collecting taxes on our income  if any  or from collecting taxes that are due under existing tax rules 
a successful assertion by one or more states or any foreign country that we should collect sales or other taxes on the exchange of merchandise on our system would harm our business 
we are dependent on key personnel our future performance will be substantially dependent on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel 
our future performance also will depend on our ability to retain and motivate our other officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
our new businesses are all dependent on attracting and retaining key employees 
the land based auction businesses are particularly dependent on specialists and senior management because of the relationships these individuals have established with sellers who consign property for sale at auction 
dean kruse is particularly important to kruse 
we have had some turnover of these types of personnel  and continued losses could result in the loss of significant future business and would harm us 
such personnel are in great demand by other online companies 
in addition  employee turnover frequently increases during the period following an acquisition as employees evaluate possible changes in compensation  culture  reporting relationships  and the direction of the business 
such increased turnover could increase our costs and reduce our future revenues 
our future success also will depend on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and customer support personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  especially for engineers and especially in the san francisco bay area  and we may be unable to successfully attract  integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
in making employment decisions  particularly in the internet and high technology industries  job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment 
fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees whose stock option strike prices are substantially above current market prices 
our new land based auction businesses need to continue to acquire properties the businesses of b b and kruse are both dependent on the continued acquisition of high quality auction properties from sellers 
their future success will depend in part on their ability to maintain an adequate supply of high quality auction property  particularly fine and decorative arts and collectibles and collectible automobiles  respectively 
there is intense competition for these pieces with other auction companies and dealers 
in addition  a small number of key senior management and specialists maintain the relationships with the primary sources of auction property and the loss of any of these individuals could harm the business of b b and kruse 
our new land based auction businesses could suffer losses from price guarantees  advances or rescissions of sales in order to secure high quality auction properties from sellers  b b and kruse may give a guaranteed minimum price or a cash advance to a seller  based on the estimated value of the property 
if the auction proceeds are less than the amount guaranteed  or less than the amount advanced and the seller does not repay the difference  the company involved will suffer a loss 
in addition  under certain circumstances a buyer who believes that an item purchased at auction does not have good title  provenance or authenticity may rescind the purchase 
under these circumstances  the company involved will lose its commissions and fees on the sale even if the seller  in accordance with the terms and conditions of sale  in turn accepts back the item and returns the funds he or she received from the sale 
we acquired real property with some of our new businesses in connection with the acquisition of kruse and b b we acquired real property including land  buildings and interests in partnerships holding land and buildings 
we have no experience in managing real property 
ownership of this property subjects us to new risks  including 
the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems  
the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning  seismic  disability act or other requirements  and 
possible disputes with tenants  partners or others 
our market is intensely competitive online personal trading market is a new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive area 
the company expects competition to intensify in the future as the barriers to entry are relatively low  and current and new competitors can launch new sites at a nominal cost using commercially available software 
depending on the category of product  ebay currently or potentially competes with a number of companies serving particular categories of goods as well as those serving broader ranges of goods 
broad based competitors include the vast majority of traditional department and general merchandise stores as well as emerging online retailers 
these include most prominently wal mart  kmart  target  sears  macy s  jc penney  montgomery ward  costco  sam s club as well as amazon 
com  buy 
com  aol

the principal competitive factors in the company s market include the following 
ability to attract buyers 
volume of transactions and selection of goods  
community cohesion and interaction  
system reliability  
customer service  
reliability of delivery and payment by users  
brand recognition  
website convenience and accessibility  
level of service fees  and 
quality of search tools 
some current and potential competitors have longer company operating histories  larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and internet markets than we do 
some of these competitors also have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources 
other online trading services may be acquired by  receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger  well established and well financed companies 
as a result  some of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we are able to 
increased competition may result in reduced operating margins  loss of market share and diminished value of our brand 
some of our competitors have offered services for free and others may do this as well 
we may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
in order to respond to changes in the competitive environment  we may  from time to time  make pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could harm our business 
for example  we implemented an insurance program that generally insures items up to a value of  with a deductible  for users with a non negative feedback rating at no cost to the user 
new technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling our competitors to offer a lower cost service 
some web based applications that direct internet traffic to certain websites may channel users to trading services that compete with us 
although we have established internet traffic arrangements with several large online services and search engine companies  these arrangements may not be renewed on commercially reasonable terms 
even if these arrangements are renewed  they may not result in increased usage of our service 
in addition  companies that control access to transactions through network access or web browsers could promote our competitors or charge us substantial fees for inclusion 
the land based auction business is intensely competitive 
b b competes with two larger and better known auction companies  sotheby s holdings  inc and christie s international plc  as well as numerous regional auction companies 
to the extent that these companies increase their focus on the middle market properties that form the core of b b s business  its business may suffer 
kruse is subject to competition from numerous regional competitors 
in addition  competition with internet based auctions may harm the land based auction business 
although billpoint s business is new  several new companies are beginning to enter this market and large companies  including banks and credit card companies  may become competitors 
our business is dependent on the development and maintenance of the web infrastructure the success of our service will depend largely on the development and maintenance of the web infrastructure 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  as well timely development of complementary products such as high speed modems  for providing reliable web access and services 
because global commerce and the online exchange of information is new and evolving  we cannot predict whether the web will prove to be a viable commercial marketplace in the long term 
the web has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic 
if the web continues to experience increased numbers of users  increased frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements  the web infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it 
in addition  the performance of the web may be harmed by increased users or bandwidth requirements 
the web has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and it could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of web usage as well as the level of traffic and the processing transactions on our service 
in addition  the web could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of activity or due to increased governmental regulation 
the infrastructure and complementary products or services necessary to make the web a viable commercial marketplace for the long term may not be developed successfully or in a timely manner 
even if these products or services are developed  the web may not become a viable commercial marketplace for services such as those that we offer 
our business is subject to online commerce security risks a significant barrier to online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
our security measures may not prevent security breaches 
our failure to prevent security breaches could harm our business 
currently  a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information  including customer credit card numbers 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect customer transaction data 
any such compromise of our security could harm our reputation and  therefore  our business 
in addition  a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
an individual has claimed to have misappropriated some of our confidential information by breaking into our computer system 
we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches 
security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our insurance policies carry low coverage limits  which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 
we must keep pace with rapid technological change to remain competitive the market in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new service and product introductions and enhancements and changing customer demands 
these market characteristics are worsened by the emerging nature of the internet and the apparent need of companies from a multitude of industries to offer web based products and services 
our future success therefore will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies  to adapt our services to evolving industry standards and to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our service 
our failure to adapt to such changes would harm our business 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new internet  networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure 
we need to develop new services  features and functions in order to expand we plan to expand our operations by developing new or complementary services  products or transaction formats or expanding the breadth and depth of services 
we may be unable to expand our operations in a cost effective or timely manner 
even if we do expand  we may not maintain or increase our overall market acceptance 
if we launch a new business or service that is not favorably received by consumers  it could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand 
we anticipate that future services may include pre and post trade services  including the following 
the scanning and uploading of photographs of listed items  
authentication and appraisal  and 
arrangements to facilitate shipment of products 
we may pursue strategic relationships with third parties to provide many of these services 
by using third parties to deliver these services  we may be unable to control the quality of these services and our ability to address problems if any of these third parties fails to perform adequately will be reduced 
expanding our operations in this manner also will require significant additional expenses and development  operations and other resources and will strain our management  financial and operational resources 
the lack of market acceptance of any new services could harm our business 
our growth will depend on our ability to develop our brand we believe that our historical growth has been largely attributable to word of mouth 
we have benefited from frequent and high visibility media exposure both nationally and locally 
we do not expect the frequency or quality of this media exposure to continue 
however  we believe that continuing to strengthen our brand will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our service 
promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide high quality services 
in order to promote our brand  we will need to increase our marketing budget and otherwise increase our financial commitment to creating and maintaining brand loyalty among users 
brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues  and even if they do  any increased revenues may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand 
if we do attract new users to our service  they may not conduct transactions over our service on a regular basis 
if we fail to promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand  our business would be harmed 
we may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights adequately we regard the protection of our copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our success 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors  and nondisclosure agreements with parties with which we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information
