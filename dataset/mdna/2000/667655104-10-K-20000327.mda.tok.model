future earnings and cash flows from utility operations will be determined largely by the pace of continued growth in the residential and commercial markets and by nw natural s ability to remain price competitive in the large industrial market  to control expenses  and to obtain reasonable and timely regulatory ratemaking treatment for investments made in utility plant 
in october  nw natural filed a general rate case in oregon proposing a revenue increase of million per year through rate increases averaging percent 
in november  the oregon public utility commission opuc issued an order authorizing a revenue increase of million per year effective dec 
  through rate increases averaging percent for residential customers  partially offset by rate decreases for certain commercial and large industrial customers 
the opuc authorized and based rates on a return on common equity roe of percent 
in an order issued in april  the opuc formalized a process that tests for excessive earnings in connection with gas utilities annual filings of rate changes due to increases or decreases in gas costs 
the opuc confirmed nw natural s ability to pass through percent of its prudently incurred gas costs into rates 
under this order  nw natural is authorized to retain all of its earnings up to a threshold level equal to its authorized roe plus basis points 
one third of any earnings above that level will be refunded to customers 
in connection with the opuc s order in the general rate case  this means that nw natural can earn up to percent on equity before sharing any additional earnings with customers 
the excess earnings threshold is subject to adjustment up or down each year depending on movements in interest rates 
the opuc approved rate increases averaging percent effective dec 
  and increases averaging percent  percent and percent effective dec

comparison of gas operations the following table summarizes the composition of gas utility volumes and revenues for the three years ended dec 
thousands except customers and degree days gas sales and transportation volumes therms residential and commercial sales    unbilled volumes    weather sensitive volumes    industrial firm sales    industrial interruptible sales    total gas sales    transportation deliveries    total volumes sold and delivered    utility operating revenues residential and commercial sales    unbilled revenues    weather sensitive revenues    industrial firm sales    industrial interruptible sales total gas sales    transportation revenues    other revenues    total utility operating revenues    cost of gas sold    total number of customers end of period    actual degree days    year average degree days    residential and commercial nw natural continues to experience rapid customer growth  with  customers added since dec 
 this represents a growth rate of percent  compared to a percent growth rate in and a record growth rate of percent in in the three years ended dec 
  approximately  customers were added to the system  representing an average annual growth rate of percent 
typically  percent or more of nw natural s annual operating revenues are derived from gas sales to weather sensitive residential and commercial customers 
accordingly  variations in temperatures between periods will affect volumes of gas sold to and revenues derived from these customers 
weather conditions were percent colder than average in  percent warmer than average in and percent warmer than average in average weather conditions are calculated from the most recent years of temperature data measured by heating degree days 
weather in was percent colder than in and was percent warmer than the volumes of gas sold to residential and commercial customers during increased percent compared to  reflecting the continued customer growth and colder weather 
related revenues increased percent due to increased volumes and the rate increases effective in and late revenue from residential and commercial customers was up percent in due to increased volumes and rate increases effective in late and in order to match revenues with related purchased gas costs  nw natural records unbilled revenues for gas delivered but not yet billed to customers through the end of the period 
industrial sales  transportation and other revenues total volumes of gas delivered to industrial customers were percent higher in than in and percent higher in than in the combined margin from industrial sales and transportation increased slightly from and decreased by percent in from the slight increase in industrial margin in and the decrease in  despite increased volumes in both and  primarily reflect the effect of low oil prices on an industrial schedule in which rates vary with oil prices  and transfers of some industrial customers to rate schedules or special contracts with lower margins

nw natural has a purchased gas cost adjustment pga tariff under which its net income from oregon operations is affected only within defined limits by changes in purchased gas costs 
nw natural absorbs percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retains percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to projections 
the remaining percent of the higher or lower gas costs are recorded as deferred debits or credits regulatory assets or liabilities for recovery from or refund to customers in future rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposures associated with activities involving derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments are natural gas commodity price risk  foreign currency risk and interest rate risk 
nw natural uses derivative financial instruments as tools to mitigate certain of these market risks see note 
nw natural enters into such instruments for hedging purposes  not for trading purposes 
market risks associated with the derivative financial instruments are monitored by management personnel who do not directly enter into these contracts and by a committee of the board of directors 
physical and financial commodity and foreign currency transactions nw natural enters into short term and long term natural gas purchase contracts with demand and commodity fixed price and variable price components  along with associated short term and long term natural gas transportation contracts 
many of the purchases made under these contracts are in canadian dollars and nw natural uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
nw natural historically has taken physical delivery of at least the minimum quantities specified in its natural gas purchase contracts 
the contracts are subject to annual re pricing  a process that is intended to reflect anticipated market price trends during the next year 
nw natural s pga mechanism in oregon provides for the recovery from customers of actual commodity costs in comparison with established benchmark costs  except that nw natural absorbs percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retains percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to projections
