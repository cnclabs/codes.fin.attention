results of operations the following analysis of net interest income  the provision for loan losses  noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes  presents the factors that are primarily responsible for the company s results of operations for and the prior two years

net interest income tax equivalent basis net interest income represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
changes in net interest income result from changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds volume and changes in the yields earned and costs paid rate 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest income may also be described as the product of earning assets and the net interest margin

the change in net interest income due to changes in rate was a decrease of thousand in and a decrease of million in as the following analysis demonstrates  prevailing interest rates economy wide began to increase in the second half of the consensus expectation  and management s expectation  is that continuing modest rate increases likely will be experienced in the first half of and perhaps in succeeding periods 
this marks a turnaround from a long period of flat or slowly declining prevailing interest rates 
the recent rate hikes did not have a significant impact on the company s financial results for  which continued to show decreases from prior periods in the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on earning liabilities  as well as relative stability in the company s net interest spread and net interest margin 
these results are reviewed in more detail below 
the ability of the company to maintain net interest spreads and net interest margins if interest rates rise in forthcoming periods will depend directly on its ability to reprice assets as rapidly as market forces may compel repricing of liabilities 
although conventional wisdom in the industry is that paying liabilities reprice more quickly than earning assets  management notes that much of the company s recent loan growth has occurred in the consumer loan sector  including indirect loans  and that this sector tends to reprice relatively quickly 
on the other hand  certain asset sectors also emphasized in the company s portfolio  such as residential mortgage loans and investment securities  are more resistant to upward repricing 
management is not able to predict with any certainty how the relative repricing of its asset and liability portfolios will proceed in forthcoming periods  or whether prevailing interest rates or the rates paid or earned by the company will continue to rise 
management does  however  expect generally increased pressure on margins  not merely for reasons of anticipated rate increases  but also due to greater competition in the company s markets and other factors 
the federal reserve board attempts to influence prevailing federal funds and prime interest rates and sets changes to the federal reserve bank discount rate 
the following chart presents recent changes key interest rate changes federal discount funds prime date rate rate rate november  august  june  november  october  september  march  january  in the fall of  after months of relative interest rate stability  the federal reserve board took steps in its open market operations leading to three basis point decreases in the federal funds target rate  which led to parallel changes in the prime rate 
during the second half of  the federal reserve board essentially reversed the actions by increasing the federal funds target rate by basis points on three occasions in june  august and november 
the prime rate rose in parallel 
although the company s spread between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities remained essentially the same for as for  net interest margin for  at  represented a basis point decrease from the net interest margin of in the one basis point decrease in the spread reflected a basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets and a basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities from to the basis point decrease in net interest margin was attributable to the difference in the change in average earning assets and paying liabilities 
from to  average earning assets increased while the increase in average paying liabilities was 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began to increase its cash and due from bank balances as a precautionary measure for any possible run on deposits as a result of perceived year problems 
this measure was one of the reasons for the fact that for average earning assets increased at a slower rate than average interest bearing liabilities 
in january  cash and due from banks returned to normal levels 
another reason is that average shareholders equity decreased by from to  in response to the decision by the board and management during to continue with a stock repurchase program 
this decrease  although a contributing factor in average paying liabilities expanding more rapidly than average earning assets  also had the positive effect of further leveraging shareholders equity  thereby increasing per share returns 
the decline in net interest margin experienced in was less than the decline experienced in net interest margin for  at  represented a basis point decrease from the net interest margin of in this reflects a basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets partially offset by a basis point decrease in the cost of paying liabilities from to the decrease in net interest margin was primarily attributable to three factors i the lack of any significant slope to the yield curve the normal slope of the yield curve is caused by higher yields for instruments with longer maturities was the most significant factor leading to the decrease in net interest margin from to  since the company was unable to obtain the same spread as in prior periods between longer term interest bearing liabilities and earning assets as those items repriced 
ii the yield on earning assets decreased more than the cost of paying liabilities from to  reflecting the competitive environment for loan products in the company s market area 
iii the company took advantage of its borrowing arrangement with the federal home loan bank fhlb to borrow up to million by year end the funds were placed in a variety of investments pending long term absorption into the loan portfolio 
in the short run  however  the spread between the rate earned on the investments and the rate paid on fhlb borrowings was narrower than the company s net interest spread generally  and thus reduced the spread as well as the net interest margin 
nevertheless  total net interest income was enhanced by the strategy  as was intended 
a discussion of the impact on net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates vis a vis the repricing patterns of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is included later in this report under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
changes in net interest income due to volume average balances dollars in thousands change change earning assets      interest bearing liabilities      demand deposits      total assets      earning assets to total assets 

in general  changes in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will result in corresponding changes in net interest income 
however  changes due to volume can be enhanced or restricted by shifts within the relative mix of earning assets or interest bearing liabilities between instruments of different rates 
the change in net interest income due to changes in volume was an increase of million in and an increase of million in average earning assets increased by million  or  between and as discussed earlier  average interest bearing liabilities increased to a somewhat greater extent  by  between the two years 
on the earning asset side  the company experienced growth in its major loan categories commercial and commercial real estate  residential real estate and particularly indirect consumer loans 
indirect consumer loans  which are primarily auto loans financed through local dealerships where the company acquires the dealer paper 
indirect consumer loans accounted for the greatest portion of growth within the loan portfolio over the past five quarters 
from to  the average balance of indirect loans increased million  or 
the company also experienced steady demand for residential real estate loans in recent periods with average balances increasing million  or  from to the increase in average earning assets was funded by a million increase in average deposit balances  a million increase in average short term borrowings and by a million increase in average fhlb borrowings 
the growth in average deposit balances occurred primarily in demand deposits  now accounts and time deposits of  or more 
the growth in demand deposits and now accounts took place through the company s existing network of branches 
the growth in time deposits of  or more was primarily attributable to an increase in the balances and number of municipal depositors 
average earning assets increased by million  or  between and average interest bearing liabilities increased similarly  by  between the two years 
this increase in volume on both sides of the balance sheet led to a million increase in net interest income from to while the fleet branch acquisition had a significant impact on the increase in average earning assets between and  due to the fact that the balances acquired from fleet in mid only had a six month impact on average earning assets in that year  the chief factor was the internal asset growth in itself 
from year end to year end earning assets increased million 
of that increase  million occurred within the loan portfolio  with nearly all of the increases attributable to indirect automobile loans and residential real estate loans 
during the company took advantage of its borrowing agreement with the fhlb accepting advances of million by year end 
the remaining increase in earning assets was essentially funded primarily by deposit growth 
increases in the volume of loans and deposits  as well as yields and costs by type  are discussed later in this report under item c financial condition

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is maintained for estimated loan losses 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when loans are deemed uncollectible 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality 
the analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for impaired and large balance loans  and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers economic outlook 
the provision for loan losses was largely influenced by the level of nonperforming loans  the level of loans actually charged off against the allowance for loan losses during the year and the change in the mix and volume of loan categories within the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses was million for  an increase of thousand  or  from while the company has experienced a decrease in nonperforming loans and gross charge offs over the past two years  the company has also experienced a shift in the mix of loan categories within the loan portfolio 
see c 
financial condition ii 
loan portfolio in this report indirect installment loans now represent the largest loan category and management perceives a higher level of risk in the current portfolio mix than in the prior periods 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of from the balance at december  the decrease was primarily attributable to one large commercial loan  originally placed on nonaccrual status during  which was fully repaid in at december   the allowance for loan losses was million 
the allowance for loan losses represented of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  or  of average loans for the period 
the principal reason for the year to year decrease in net loan losses was a recovery of thousand related to the final repayment of the large commercial loan cited above 
excluding the large recovery  net loan losses for was 
of average loans 
the provision for loan losses charged to expense for was million  or  of average loans for the period 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of from the balance at december  the decrease was primarily attributable to one large commercial loan  placed on nonaccrual status during  which fully paid off in at december  the allowance for loan losses was million 
the allowance for loan losses was of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  or  of average loans for the period 
the provision for loan losses charged to expense for was million  or  of average loans for the period 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  an increase of from the balance at december  the increase was primarily attributable to a large commercial loan placed on nonaccrual status during  the same loan discussed above that was fully paid off in at december  the allowance for loan losses was million 
the allowance for loan losses was of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were million  or  of average loans for the period 
the provision for loan losses charged to expense for was million  or  of average loans for the period 
in addition  in mid  the company made a purchase acquisition adjustment to the allowance of thousand for loans acquired in the fleet branch transaction 
this adjustment represented the allowance for inherent risk of loss in the loans acquired 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  or  of average loans for the period 
however  the allowance for loan losses was significantly reduced during the year by million 
this was the amount of the reserve attributable to loans transferred in the divestiture of the vermont banking operations 
these reductions in the allowance for loan losses were offset in part by a provision for loan losses of thousand  or  of average loans for the year 
at december  the allowance for loan losses was million 
the allowance for loan losses was of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
during  nonperforming assets continued the steady decline begun in the primary portion of the decrease in nonperforming assets in came from the sale of oreo out of the vermont banking operations 
nonaccrual loans increased thousand or  from the year end balance 
the increase in nonaccrual loans was due primarily to the aggregate borrowing of one large commercial borrower  which was placed on nonaccrual status in that loan was accounted for under sfas no 
and was being carried at its estimated fair value 
loans reported as troubled debt restructures at december   were classified as performing in net loan losses for were million 
these losses compare to net loan losses of million for the year ended december  as a ratio to average loans  the net loan losses were 
and  for the same respective periods 
the company s year experience with loan charge offs  provisioning for loan losses and maintenance of its loss allowance reveals a steady strengthening of loan quality and continuing application of high credit standards 
the coverage ratio was at its highest level at year end  compared to the past five years  but the allowance as a percentage of total period end loans was only  marking a year low 
while management believes that the year end allowance was adequate under the circumstances  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy  might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher incidence of loan charge offs

the company closed nearly residential loans during the year  amounting to million of loan originations 
unlike  the increase in residential real estate loans in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of such loans incident to the purchase of the branches from fleet bank 
in  the company also continued to expand its indirect automobile lending program  which was the primary factor in the million increase in installment loans to individuals from to the company also experienced an increase in consumer installment loans in with most of the increase attributable to the fleet branch acquisition and the remainder principally due to steady growth of the indirect loan program 
although the yields on the consumer portfolios other than credit card loans typically are lower than on the commercial portfolios  the company has historically experienced fewer loan losses in consumer loans than commercial loans  in proportion to outstanding average loan balances 
in the fleet branch acquisition completed on june   the company acquired million of loans consumer loans million  home equity loans million  commercial loans million  commercial real estate loans million  and residential real estate loans million 
the communities served by the acquired branches have contributed to the internal loan growth experienced by the company since the closing of the branch acquisition 
during  the company transferred substantially all of the loans in its vermont banking operation in two branch sale transactions  the sale of eight branches to mascoma savings bank in january and the sale of the company s remaining six vermont branches to albank in september the vermont loan portfolio had a higher percentage of commercial loans than the loan portfolios of the company s new york banks 
consequently  the divestiture of the vermont banking operations was largely responsible for the shift in the mix of the loan portfolio from commercial to consumer loans between year end and year end this shift was augmented by the company s concentration in new york upon residential real estate loans and installment loans to individuals primarily automobile loans 
the following table indicates the changing mix in the company s loan portfolio by presenting the quarterly average balances for the company s significant loan products for the past five quarters

due to the lagged effect interest rate changes have on the company s loan portfolio  however  these increases had only a limited impact on the average yield of the company s portfolio by year end the trend of declining interest rates slowed down in the third and fourth quarters of  but did not increase significantly on a portfolio wide basis 
management expects that overall  the yield on the loan portfolio will begin to increase in the first quarter of as variable rate instruments reprice and new loans are added at current market rates 
the following table indicates the respective maturities and repricing structure of the company s commercial  financial and agricultural loans and its real estate construction loans at december  for purposes of determining relevant maturities  loans are assumed to mature at but not before their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual terms

as of december   the total contingent liability for standby letters of credit amounted to million 
in addition to these instruments  the company has issued lines of credit to customers  including home equity lines of credit  credit card lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit  which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time to time 
commercial lines  generally issued for a period of one year  are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the borrower 
at december   the company had outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount of approximately million

risk elements nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the company designates loans as nonaccrual when the payment of interest and or principal is due and unpaid for a designated period generally days or when the likelihood of the full repayment of principal and interest is  in the opinion of management  uncertain 
when nonaccrual loans reach days delinquent  they are charged off against the allowance for loan losses in an amount equal to unpaid principal less the fair value of collateral plus estimated costs to sell 
there were no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at december  loans and leases past due days or more and still accruing interest  as identified in the following table  are those loans and leases which were contractually past due days or more but because of expected repayments  were still accruing interest 
sfas no 
requires that impaired loans  except for large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  be measured based on i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over  and to all restructured loans 
reserves for losses for the remaining smaller balance loans are evaluated under sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 the company determines impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
the company determines the interest income recognition method on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recognition methods include full accrual  cash basis and cost recovery

there were no loans at december  accounted for under sfas no 
at december   one commercial loan was accounted for as an impaired loan under sfas no 
with a recorded investment of thousand with an allowance for loan losses of thousand for a carrying amount of thousand 
this loan was included in nonaccrual loans in the schedule of nonperforming loans above

at december   nonaccrual loans amounted to million  a decrease of million from the year end total 
during  nearly all of the nonaccrual loans in the vermont portfolio were transferred in connection with the sale of the vermont operations that year 
nonaccrual loans in the company s new york subsidiary banks at december  were virtually unchanged from the level at the prior year end 
over one half of the nonaccrual balance at december  was attributable to one borrower whose loan was restructured in payments on that loan were current in accordance with the restructured terms as of december  and all payments in were used to reduce the carrying amount of the loan 
during income recognized on year end balances of nonaccrual loans was thousand 
income that would have been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if all such had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was thousand 
potential problem loans on at least a quarterly basis  the company applies an internal credit quality rating system to past due commercial loans 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less than the contractual amounts  even if such loans are not days past due 
because of its aggressive approach toward placing commercial loans on nonaccrual status  the company has not separately identified any potential problem loans in this report not included in the classifications discussed above 
the overall level of classified and problem loans is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern new york state 
in general  the economy in the company s geographic market area has been strong in recent periods 
in the capital district in and around albany  unemployment is significantly below the national average  and north of the capital district  the total number of jobs has held steady over recent periods with nominal growth in the job rate 
however  unemployment remains above the national average in the glens falls and plattsburgh areas 
foreign outstandings none loan concentrations the loan portfolio is well diversified 
there are no concentrations of credit that exceed of the portfolio  other than the general categories reported in the preceding section iia of this report

summary of loan loss experience the company monitors credit quality through a continuous review of the entire loan portfolio 
all significant loans primarily commercial and commercial real estate are reviewed at least semi annually  and those under special supervision are reviewed at least quarterly 
the boards of directors of the company s subsidiary banks  upon recommendations from management  determine the extent of charge offs and have the final decision making responsibility in authorizing charge offs 
additionally  regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of the banks loan portfolios and report on these examinations to the boards of directors 
through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is maintained for estimated loan losses 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when they are identified 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality 
the analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for impaired and large balance loans  and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers economic outlook 
in addition to conclusions regarding the adequacy of the allowance  the provision for loan losses is influenced by the level of nonperforming loans  by the level of loans actually charged off against the allowance during the year and the change in the mix of loan categories within the loan portfolio 
the table in part ii  item bii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses presents a summary of the activity in the company s allowance for loan losses 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a general allowance applicable to losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
for internal operating purposes  the allowance is not allocated among loan categories 
in the following table  the allowance has been allocated solely for purposes of complying with disclosure requirements of the securities and exchange commission 
however  this allocation should not be interpreted as a projection of i likely sources of future charge offs  ii likely proportional distribution of future charge offs among loan categories or iii likely amounts of future charge offs 
on a quarterly basis  management risk classifies delinquent or problem loans except for consumer installment loans as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
reserves are assigned to all loans by either a specific allocation  a risk classified loss percentage or by a percentage applied to individual categories of loans 
since management regards the allowance as a general balance and has assigned an unallocated value to the schedule  the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future charge offs that might occur within the principal categories 
subject to the qualifications noted above  an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by principal classification and the proportion of the related loan balance is presented below as of december for each of the years indicated

during  the company opened a branch in queensbury  new york 
from to  average deposit balances increased million  or 
the principal cause of the increase was the acquisition of the fleet branches on june   by which the company assumed million of deposit balances demand million  interest bearing demand deposits million  regular and money market savings million  and other time deposits million

during  the company experienced growth in noninterest bearing and interest bearing demand deposit accounts  both in total dollars and as a percent of total deposits as indicated in the table below percentage of total quarterly average deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits quarterly cost of deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits including non interest bearing in general  rates paid by the company on its various types of deposit accounts are influenced by the rates being offered or paid by its competitors  which themselves are influenced by prevailing interest rates in the economy as impacted from time to time by the actions of the federal reserve board 
there typically is a time lag between the federal reserve s actions undertaken to influence rates and the actual repricing of deposit liabilities by the company 
thus  the three increases in the federal funds target rate initiated by the federal reserve in june  august and november of  while reflected to some degree in the last two quarters of the company s cost of deposits analysis above  may not have its full effect on deposit rates until subsequent periods 
moreover  the federal reserve has continued to take a cautionary approach in early toward possible inflationary pressures in the economy  signaling that additional rate increases are likely 
for the above reasons  management believes that the cost of deposits will likely increase in forthcoming periods

liquidity liquidity is measured by the ability of the company to raise cash when it needs it at a reasonable cost 
the company must be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to its customers at any time 
given the uncertain nature of customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings  the company must have available reasonably priced sources of funds  on and off balance sheet  that can be accessed quickly in time of need 
securities available for sale represent a primary source of balance sheet cash flow 
certain investment securities are selected at purchase as available for sale based on their marketability and collateral value  as well as their yield and maturity 
in addition to liquidity arising from balance sheet cash flows  the company has supplemented liquidity with additional off balance sheet sources such as credit lines with the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the company has established overnight and day term lines of credit with the federal home loan bank fhlb each in the amount of  at december  if advanced  such lines of credit will be collateralized by mortgage backed securities  loans and fhlb stock 
in addition  the company has in place borrowing facilities from correspondent banks and the federal reserve bank of new york 
the company also has identified wholesale and retail repurchase agreements and brokered certificates of deposit as appropriate off balance sheet sources of funding 
the company measures its basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities  both with and without the availability of borrowing arrangements 
understanding that excess liquidity will have a negative impact on earnings  the company establishes a target range for its liquidity ratios 
at december   the company was operating within those thresholds 
e 
capital resources and dividends shareholders equity was million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the prior year end 
the decrease in shareholders equity during primarily reflected million of retained earnings offset by million of periodic repurchases of the company s common stock and by million in unrealized securities holding losses in the available for sale portfolio 
in december  the company  through a newly formed subsidiary business trust  privately placed million in capital securities with several institutional investors 
the securities have certain features that make them an alternative funding vehicle and the proceeds qualify as regulatory capital under the capital adequacy guidelines discussed below 
the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
the company s principal capital planning goal is to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient base to provide for future expansion and comply with all regulatory standards 
one set of regulatory capital guidelines applicable to the company and the subsidiary banks are the so called risk based capital measures 
under these measures  the minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets is and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
for the company  tier capital is comprised of shareholders equity and capital securities issued by the company s subsidiary business trust less intangible assets 
total capital includes tier capital plus other qualifying regulatory capital  including a portion of the company s allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the risk based capital measures  the federal bank regulatory agencies require banks and bank holding companies to satisfy another capital guideline  the tier leverage ratio tier capital to quarterly average assets less intangible assets 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for the most highly rated institutions 
the guidelines provide that other institutions should maintain a tier leverage ratio that is at least to higher than the minimum level for top rated institutions 
the table below sets forth the capital ratios of the company and its subsidiary banks as of december  risk based capital ratios arrow gfnb snb tier total capital tier leverage ratio at december   both subsidiary banks and the company exceeded the minimum capital ratios established by these guidelines  and qualified as well capitalized  the highest category  in the capital classification scheme set by federal bank regulatory agencies see the disclosure under legislative developments in part i  item f of this report

year disclosure concerns over the arrival of the year yk and its impact on the embedded computer technologies used by financial institutions  among others  led bank regulatory authorities to require substantial advance testing and preparations by all banking organizations  including the company 
as of the date of this filing  the company has experienced no material problems in connection with the arrival of yk  either in connection with the services and products it provides to its customers or in connection with the services and products it receives from third party vendors or suppliers 
however  while no such occurrence has developed  yk issues may arise that may not become immediately apparent 
therefore  the company will continue to monitor and work to remedy any issues that arise 
although the company expects that its business will not be materially impacted  such future events cannot be known with certainty 
the company originally projected yk expenditures of between thousand and thousand 
yk expenditures through december   were approximately thousand 
the company s yk costs did not include internal personnel costs  which were not significantly greater as a result of the year readiness activities  or external consulting or advisory fees  which were minimal 
the company s expenditures were predominantly for upgrading or replacement of hardware and software systems  with hardware accounting for approximately of such expenditures and for software 
the company funded its year related expenditures out of general operating resources 
forward looking statement warnings the above year disclosure contains a forward looking statement that  in the last sentence of the first paragraph  is based on the company s and management s assumptions  expectations  estimates and projections 
this statement may prove to be inaccurate or incomplete  and is dependant on unknown developments and facts 
it should be read in light of the various risks and uncertainties cited in the lead in paragraph in this report 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to credit risk in the company s loan portfolio and liquidity risk  discussed earlier  the company s business activities also generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will make the company s position less valuable 
the ongoing monitoring and management of risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management to management s asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as to prepayment risks for mortgage related assets  early withdrawal of time deposits  and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies by product 
the alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates  where interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice at their earliest possible repricing date 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
applying the simulation model analysis as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income  and a basis point decrease in interest rates demonstrated a increase in net interest income 
these amounts were within the company s alco policy limits 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
as noted elsewhere in this report  the federal reserve board took certain actions in the second half of to increase the prevailing interest rates  after a prolonged period of flat or declining interest rates 
management believes it likely that rates will continue to rise in forthcoming periods  but is not able to predict with any certainty that a sustained period of rising interest rates will have an effect on the company s financial results in forthcoming periods similar to the results generated by the sensitivity analysis discussed in the preceding paragraph 
the hypothetical estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  management cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
