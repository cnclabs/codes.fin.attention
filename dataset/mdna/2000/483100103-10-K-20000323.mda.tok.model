item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
in addition to developing the kaiser commerce center alone or with others  the company also pursued the possible sale of the kaiser commerce center 
as discussed below  the company has entered into an agreement to sell the kaiser commerce and the east slag pile property 
if such transaction closes  the buyer will be responsible to pay or finance all of these infrastructure improvements 
agreement to sell mill site property 
in october  the company and its wholly owned subsidiary  kaiser steel land development  inc  entered into a purchase and sale agreement and joint escrow instructions the purchase agreement with ontario partners i  llc the buyer pursuant to which the company agreed to sell approximately acres of its remaining mill site property for million in cash plus the assumption of virtually all known and unknown environmental obligations and risks associated with the property 
the sale includes the proposed kaiser commerce center with its proposed truck stop and the east slag pile property  as well as ancillary items such as the water rights associated with the property 
as part of the transaction  the buyer will provide environmental insurance coverage and other financial assurance mechanisms related to the known and unknown environmental obligations and risks associated with the property being sold 
in addition  the purchase agreement provides that  to the extent possible  the company s consent order with the california department of toxic substances control dtsc will be terminated and that the buyer will enter into a new consent order with the dtsc 
a consent order is essentially an agreement to investigate and remediate property 
the buyer is currently negotiating a new consent order with the dtsc 
the buyer is a new entity formed by landbank environmental properties  llc landbank and the knowlton group  a salt lake city based developer 
landbank  a wholly owned subsidiary of the it group  specializes in the acquisition  restoration and redevelopment of environmentally impaired real estate 
it is currently anticipated that a new entity will be formed in which landbank  the knowlton group and one or more other companies will become members and that such new entity will ultimately be the buyer of the real estate if it closes 
the buyer has discussed with several entities the possibility of participating in the transaction  and it has currently identified catellus development corporation as its most likely additional development and financial partner 
the transaction is subject to extensive due diligence and a number of contingencies 
the buyer has been engaged in  and continues to undertake  extensive due diligence with respect to the property it may purchase  including  among other things  environmental  development  construction and market matters 
the buyer may terminate the transaction for any reason prior to the close of its due diligence period 
the purchase agreement has been amended to allow buyer additional time in which to conduct its due diligence and to complete its negotiations with the dtsc 
the contingency period has been extended into the second quarter of if the buyer is satisfied with the results of its due diligence and all other contingencies are resolved  such as the negotiation of the final terms of certain exhibits to the purchase agreement  the transaction is currently scheduled to close during the second quarter of given the due diligence to be undertaken by the buyer and the contingencies involved  there can be no assurance that the transaction will be ultimately consummated or  if consummated  that it will close under the current terms set forth in the purchase agreement

other sales of mill site property 
in addition to entering into an agreement in to sell the bulk of the company s mill site property  with the exception of the acre tar pits parcel  the company has sold  or is in negotiation for the sale of the remaining approximately acres of the mill site not being sold to ontario ventures i  llc 
on november   one of the napa lots of approximately acres was sold for a gross cash sales price of  or per square foot 
on the same day  a sliver of land of approximately 
of an acre was sold to an adjoining landowner for approximately  or per square foot 
the company accepted a promissory note for the  purchase price 
the remaining napa lot of approximately acres was sold in december for a cash sales price of  or per square foot 
the company is negotiating the sale of the remaining acres  known as the rancho cucamonga property 
there is no assurance that the negotiations for this property will ultimately lead to a sale of the property 
sewer services 
the company operates a sewage treatment facility that serves property historically owned by the company or ksc 
the company currently provides sanitary sewer services from its sewage treatment plant located on the northeastern end of the south mill site property to california steel industries  inc  the budway facility  the wvmrf  the california speedway and is anticipated to serve the balance of the mill site property 
in  total revenue of  was derived from the sewer treatment facility with the company receiving  of such revenue from the california speedway corporation pursuant to a sewer services agreement 
the california speedway corporation currently also has the option to purchase the company s sewer treatment 
upgrades of the sewer treatment facility may be required to accommodate the development of the mill site property and future regulatory changes 
mill site environmental matters the operation of a steel mill by the company s predecessor  ksc  resulted in known contamination of limited portions of the company s mill site property  including limited portions of the property previously sold by the company 
the company is subject to a consent order the consent order with the dtsc  which requires the company to investigate and remediate hazardous materials on the mill site property 
under the consent order  as amended  the phased remediation is scheduled to be completed by july the consent order  as amended  provides for a general outline of the known tasks and the timing of performing such tasks 
any particular item of investigation and or remediation can be modified with the consent of the dtsc 
as discussed above  under the terms of the proposed sale for virtually all the company s remaining mill site property  it is expected that the consent order will be terminated and the buyer will enter into a new consent order with the dtsc 
thus  the buyer will become responsible for all future investigation and remediation of the mill site property if the mill site property is sold under its current terms 
during and in early  as in prior years  the company undertook a number of activities with regard to environmental matters 
these activities included  but were not limited to remediation of affected soils and materials on approximately acres of the west end property  conducting tests for a proposed solidification and capping remediation alternative for the tar pits  investigation and closure of the west slag pile property  completion of the investigation and closure on the household recycling property which is being contributed to the wvmrf  and completion of the investigation and remediation issues associated with the sewer treatment facility 
in addition  in february  the company obtained approval for a corrective action management unit camu now called a consolidated waste cell or cwc from the dtsc 
the cwc is in the northeast portion of the east slag pile property on land that was previously used by a bankrupt former tenant of ksc for a waste pickling facility and is used for the on site disposal of affected soils and materials from the balance of the mill site property 
the cwc has been constructed and remains open to potentially receive affected soils and materials that may be uncovered during the grading of the kaiser commerce center that is acceptable for deposit into the cwc 
upon termination of the use of the cwc  the cwc will be capped and closed in compliance with the dtsc s policies 
the cwc is a less expensive alternative than transporting the affected soils and materials to an off site disposal facility 
while the company has monitored certain groundwater wells in the past  the dtsc requested and the company intends to implement  a supplemental groundwater investigation study 
the principal purpose of the study upon its implementation is to confirm the conclusion of historic tests that the groundwater does not require any remedial action for hazardous substances 
a draft supplemental groundwater study was submitted to the dtsc in for its review and comment 
the company and the dtsc have been meeting on and exchanging comments on the supplemental groundwater investigation plan and its implementation 
however  with the possible sale of virtually all the mill site property  the discussions between the dtsc and the company have been limited as the buyer is engaged in discussions on the method and scope of the groundwater investigation as a part of its negotiations with the dtsc for a new consent order 
as a part of the supplemental study of groundwater  in late  the company drilled the first two test wells on the california speedway tcs property 
results from these two test wells do indicate that groundwater at the location of the test wells is not contaminated with hazardous substances and will not require remediation 
additional periodic testing of these wells is required 
the company will also be required to begin testing groundwater monitoring wells associated with the cwc within the next several months 
in addition  the company previously settled certain obligations of groundwater contamination with the california regional water quality control board concerning a plume containing total dissolved solids  sulfate and organic carbon to which the historic steel operations contributed 
the settlement required a million cash payment by the company  which was made in february  and the contribution of  acre feet of water annually for years to a water quality improvement project 
these water rights are unrelated to those leased to cucamonga 
approximately years ahead of schedule  the company contributed the full  acre feet required under the terms of the settlement agreement with the california regional water quality control board 
this contribution of water completed all of the company s obligations under the terms of the settlement agreement 
the company s cost for investigation  remediation  site cleanup  and all other environmental related activities for totaled approximately million 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item of this form k report for additional information 
while there continue to be a number of smaller mill site property environmental projects  the major outstanding environmental issues to be addressed  based on currently known information  are i the approximately acre parcel containing the tar pits  which is located adjacent to the wvmrf property  ii the east slag pile waste management unit sometimes referred to as the east slag pile landfill  iii groundwater related items  including additional groundwater monitoring  and iv the completion of the above described cwc 
the company estimates  based upon current information  that its future remediation and other environmental costs for the balance of its land and related matters will be between approximately million and million depending both upon the ultimate extent of the environmental remediation and clean up involved and upon which approved remediation alternatives are eventually selected 
this range assumes a a capping alternative can be used for the east slag pile waste management unit on the east slag pile property  b a capping alternative can be used for the tar pits parcel  c that the cwc can accept substantially all the affected soils and materials currently scheduled for deposit into the cwc and any newly discovered affected soils and materials  and d no significant groundwater remediation is required 
to date  the cwc has been able to accept substantially all the affected soils and materials originally contemplated to be deposited into the cwc although there is no assurance that the dtsc will allow future deposits of affected soils and materials into the cwc 
as of december   the total short term and long term environmental remediation liability reflected on the company s balance sheet was approximately million  the high end of the current probable range of future remediation and other environmental costs 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item of the form k report 
although additional environmental investigations will be conducted on the company s property and management believes it is currently in a position to estimate with some reasonable certainty future investigation and remediation costs  there can be no assurance that the actual amount of environmental remediation expenditures to be incurred will not substantially exceed those currently anticipated or that additional areas of contamination may not be identified 
accordingly  future facts and circumstances could cause these estimates to change significantly 
further  the company has provided certain financial assurances to the dtsc in connection with anticipated remediation activities  the primary one being the current dedication of approximately million of kaiser s union bank credit facility 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
if the kaiser commerce center and east slag pile property are sold as discussed above  the buyer is assuming  with limited exceptions  all known and unknown environmental obligations associated with the purchased property as well as certain liabilities associated with property previously sold by the company 
the company is also involved  from time to time  in legal proceedings concerning environmental matters 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
eagle mountain townsite the eagle mountain townsite  which is owned debt free by the company and now covers approximately  acres  consists of more than houses of which approximately have been renovated for current occupancy  a water supply and sewage treatment system  an office building  machine shops  school facilities and other structures 
the land exchange with the blm that was completed in october  expanded the eagle mountain townsite from approximately acres to approximately  acres see page federal land exchange and land exchange litigation in this form k report when the eagle mountain iron ore mine was operational  the eagle mountain townsite provided housing for mine employees and their families 
except for many buildings and relating piping having asbestos containing materials  there is no known material environmental remediation required at eagle mountain 
the company s wholly owned subsidiary  kaiser eagle mountain  inc  owns and operates the eagle mountain townsite 
the company currently leases a portion of the eagle mountain townsite to a private company  which operates a minimum security prison for the state of california 
the lease for the private prison currently goes through june  in order to redevelop the eagle mountain townsite  the company filed a specific plan with the county of riverside 
the townsite specific plan was included in the processing of the landfill project s land use and environmental documentation and approvals 
implementation of the townsite specific plan was in abeyance until resolution of the landfill project eir appeal 
other redevelopment opportunities other property ownership and development 
the company owns a number of real estate parcels and mineral deposits in the california desert  including the morris lode properties  an active iron ore mine leased to a third party the silver lake mine  and improved and unimproved property at lake tamarisk  an unincorporated community located approximately eight miles from the eagle mountain site 
the company has decided to seek appropriate offers for the sale of these miscellaneous assets 
municipal solid waste management the west valley mrf west valley mrf  llc 
california law currently requires all municipalities to recycle or divert of their solid waste streams from landfills 
in addition  counties are required to demonstrate to the state of california that they have at least years of available landfill capacity 
in order to meet these requirements  municipalities can arrange for transportation of solid waste to an independent or municipally owned materials recovery facility  commonly referred to as a mrf  which will separate recyclable materials for either storage or sale to a variety of users 
the residue waste from the recycling process is disposed of at landfills 
in response to this potential market opportunity  in the company and burrtec waste industries  inc burrtec  a local municipal and commercial solid waste hauler  through wholly owned subsidiaries  formed west valley mrf  llc 
west valley mrf  llc was formed to construct and operate the wvmrf  a material recovery and transfer facility 
effective june   a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  kaiser recycling corporation krc and west valley recycling transfer  inc wvrt  burrtec s wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a members operating agreement moa which is substantially the equivalent of a joint venture agreement but for a limited liability company 
other ancillary and related agreements to the moa were also entered into as of june  pursuant to the terms of the moa  krc contributed approximately acres of the mill site on which phase of the wvmrf was constructed and wvrt contributed all of the goodwill of burrtec s recycling business that was operated out of riverside county entitling west valley mrf  llc to all revenues generated from such business after the closing date 
under the terms of the moa  krc and the company remain responsible for any pre existing environmental conditions and wvrt is responsible for environmental issues that may arise related to the future deposit or release  if any  of hazardous substances 
the moa also addresses a number of other terms and conditions 
the company and burrtec have each given their separate performance guaranty agreement pursuant to which they respectively guaranty the prompt performance of their respective subsidiary s obligations under the moa and in the case of burrtec  also under the operations and maintenance agreement which deals with the daily operation of the wvmrf by wvrt 
financing  construction and operation of the wvmrf 
phase of the wvmrf  which includes a  square foot building  sorting equipment  and related facilities for waste transfer and recycling services  was constructed and initially equipped  at a total cost of approximately million  in the last half of the wvmrf is currently operating at its capacity in that it receives and processes approximately  tons per day of non hazardous commercial and municipal solid waste 
waste is primarily received from jurisdictions for which burrtec has hauling contracts  from the city of ontario  and from a large public waste hauler 
most of the financing for phase i was obtained through the issuance and sale of  in california pollution control financing authority the authority variable rate demand solid waste disposal revenue bonds series a the bonds 
this was a tax exempt financing transaction secured by a pledge and lien on the loan payments made by west valley mrf  llc and funds that may be drawn on an irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by union bank of california  na union bank 
the bonds are backed by a letter of credit issued by union bank 
pursuant to a guaranty agreement with union bank  the company and krc are liable for fifty percent of the principal and interest on the bonds in the event of a default by west valley mrf  llc 
burrtec and its affiliates in effect are also liable under a separate guaranty agreement with union bank for the other fifty percent of the principal and interest on the bonds in the event of a default by borrower 
the interest rate for the bonds varies weekly and averaged  for  less than 
the bonds have a stated maturity date of june   although the west valley mrf  llc is required  pursuant to an agreement with union bank  to annually redeem a portion of the bonds on a stated schedule 
west valley mrf  llc and union bank have also executed a reimbursement agreement  which among other things  sets the terms and conditions whereby the west valley mrf  llc is i required to repay union bank in the event of a draw under the letter of credit  ii grants the union bank certain security interests in the property of west valley mrf  llc  iii establishes the redemption schedule for the bonds  and iv sets forth certain financial and other covenants west valley mrf  llc must comply with during the term of the bonds 
the company and krc have also provided to union bank an environmental guaranty agreement pursuant to which they are jointly and severally liable for any liability that may be imposed on union bank for pre existing environmental conditions on the borrower s property acquired from krc that the borrower fails to timely address 
see also item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
since the wvmrf is currently at its phase capacity of  tons per day  the wvmrf is expanding to its permitted capacity of approximately  tons per day at an estimated cost of approximately million 
this expansion  which is anticipated to be completed in the fall of  will increase the processing facility by an additional  square feet and will provide for additional materials recovery sorting capacity 
phase ii of the wvmrf will be financed from cash on hand and from a construction loan from union bank 
wvmrf is seeking again to secure approval of tax exempt bonds issued by the authority for permanent financing 
there is no guarantee that such financing will be made available for the phase ii expansion project 
competition 
although other entities have proposed to develop mrf s that would serve the same broad geographic area as that of the wvmrf  the company believes that none of them has yet completed the permitting process 
however  a mrf is proposed in the city of pomona approximately miles from the wvmrf  which is nearing the completion of its permitting process 
if the pomona mrf is built  it would be a competitor in a portion of the wvmrf s market 
in addition  burrtec owns and operates a mrf in agua mansa  california located approximately miles from the wvmrf that could compete in very limited areas for waste that might otherwise go to the wvmrf 
to date  the mrf in agua mansa has had little impact on the wvmrf s market for customers 
eagle mountain landfill project background 
many of southern california s current landfills are located in urban areas and are old  unlined  lack current environmental safeguards and are often considered nuisances by their neighbors 
furthermore  it is becoming increasingly expensive and difficult to permit and open new landfills or to expand existing landfills in urban areas due to political opposition and stringent government regulations 
the company believes that southern california will begin to face a shortage of safe  permitted landfill capacity within the next to years 
the eagle mountain site 
the company s  acre eagle mountain site  located in the remote california desert approximately miles east of los angeles  consists of three large open pit mines  the eagle mountain townsite and a mile private rail line that accesses the site 
the company has leased approximately  acres of the idled mine site and the rail line to mrc for development of a rail haul solid waste landfill the landfill project 
as discussed in more detail below  effective as of january   the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  eagle mountain reclamation  inc emr  became a shareholder in mrc and  through subsequent investments in mrc  is currently an approximately shareholder in mrc 
in anticipation of southern california s ultimate need for new environmentally safe landfill capacity  mrc in began the planning and permitting for a  ton per day rail haul  non hazardous solid waste landfill at kaiser s eagle mountain site 
as discussed in more detail below  the permitting process was effectively completed in december  when the landfill project received its last major permit 
the company believes that the eagle mountain site has many unique attributes which make it particularly well suited for a rail haul  solid waste landfill including  but not limited to  its remote location  arid climate  available and suitable materials for the proposed liner system and daily cover  and rail access 
current plans for operation of the landfill anticipate that non hazardous household solid waste will initially be delivered to mrf s and transfer facilities throughout southern california by municipalities and independent waste haulers 
recyclable and hazardous materials will be separated at these facilities  and the remaining non hazardous solid waste will be transported  primarily by rail  in closed and locked containers to the eagle mountain landfill 
mrc currently anticipates that the landfill s initial operations  depending upon the level of disposal fees  could commence with a minimum of approximately  tons of solid waste per day 
founding  ownership and restructuring of mrc 
mrc was formed in by waste industry professionals to address the anticipated solid waste disposal problem in southern california 
in order to utilize kaiser s eagle mountain site  the company  through its subsidiary kaiser eagle mountain  inc  entered into a lease with mrc in for the development of the landfill project the mrc lease 
in  a subsidiary of browning ferris industries bfi  purchased a interest in mrc 
bfi provided a majority of mrc s funding subsequent to its initial investment  which resulted in bfi becoming the majority owner of mrc 
as of august   the ownership of mrc was restructured as part of bfi s withdrawal from mrc 
as part of the restructuring  bfi returned to mrc all of its common and preferred stock in mrc and paid off all of mrc s outstanding bank indebtedness leaving mrc substantially debt free 
in addition  bfi provided mrc with funds in excess of  to be used to fund ongoing development activities 
mrc was further restructured effective january   when the company through eagle mountain reclamation emr  a wholly owned subsidiary separate from the subsidiary that owns the land at eagle mountain  acquired common stock in mrc representing a ownership interest 
this transaction was effective as of january  in exchange for the ownership interest  the mrc lease was amended to eliminate mrc s obligation to pay minimum rent 
mrc forgave all current contingent non recourse obligations the company would have had to repay mrc out of future royalties 
operation and financing of mrc 
with the acquisition of the equity interest in mrc in  the company  through mrc  has taken a more active role in making rail haul landfills a reality  permitting the landfill project and in assisting mrc  as appropriate  in raising the funds necessary to operate conduct its business 
the completion of the landfill project is dependent upon  among other things  mrc s continuing ability to raise additional equity capital 
although neither the company nor any subsidiary of the company has any obligation to invest funds in mrc  the company has continued  to date  to make investments in mrc 
through a series of private placements with existing mrc shareholders  from july through the end of  a total of million will have been raised by mrc  with kaiser contributing approximately million of that amount 
it is anticipated that the company may make additional investments in mrc and may pursue other opportunities that the company believes are necessary or appropriate to make rail haul landfills a reality 
in order to bring the landfill project to full realization mrc continues to pursue other alternatives and financing from prospective investors as well as other means of raising funds or commitments such as the sale of capacity rights  air space or disposal agreements 
mrc lease 
in connection with the reorganization of mrc  the mrc lease was amended effective july   and again amended effective january   with the company s acquisition of a interest in mrc 
under the terms of the mrc lease  as amended to date  mrc is responsible for substantially all project costs and activities  including landfill design  permitting  construction and operation 
mrc has also agreed to indemnify the company against claims arising from mrc s activities  including any environmental damage that may be caused to the leased property by mrc s operations 
the mrc lease also provides  among other things that i the company must give mrc notice of any proposed sale of its interest in the eagle mountain property  and mrc has a right of first refusal to purchase such interest under certain circumstances  ii the company and mrc may not participate in another project that employs a railroad in connection with the storage or disposal of solid waste in counties surrounding the landfill  and iii mrc has certain rights to terminate the mrc lease including a upon the company s default under the terms of the mrc lease  b upon days notice at any time during the six month period immediately following the receipt of all the necessary permits for the landfill project  and c at any time upon two year s notice 
the mrc lease was again amended as of january  the amendment reduced the amount of land that mrc leases from the company by approximately 
mrc continues to lease from the company all the real property necessary for the project 
the company maintains and may exercise all rights it has under the mrc lease  including the right to re acquire the land leased to mrc through its subsidiary  kaiser eagle mountain  inc  for the landfill project 
in the event the company re acquires the landfill project  depending upon the circumstances  such as upon mrc s default due to lack of funds  the non bfi shareholders  at the time of the july amendment to the mrc lease  shall have the right to continue in the project in some manner 
lease economics 
until january   mrc paid to the company a minimum monthly rent 
however  in conjunction with the company s acquisition of its equity interest in mrc  the mrc lease was amended effective january   to eliminate the minimum monthly rent 
the elimination of the minimum monthly rent did not change the future royalty payments due the company upon the commencement of landfill operations 
once the landfill is operational  under the current terms of the mrc lease  the company will receive  as landlord of the eagle mountain site  the greater of i a royalty of per ton of waste received  or ii a royalty payment calculated as a designated percentage of the landfill tipping fees charged by mrc 
the future royalty payment paid to the company by mrc is based on mrc s gross collections  which are basically equivalent to the tipping fees to be charged by mrc at the landfill 
in calculating gross collections  mrc may deduct certain items  including any federal or state fees  the host fees paid to riverside county and other charges imposed or required to be collected at the landfill 
certain other revenues are also excluded from the definition of gross collections  including any mrc revenue from salvage  recycling or reclamation operations or from the disposal of waste from certain areas near the landfill project 
in addition to the royalty payment  the company will receive an additional royalty for every ton of waste transported to the landfill on the company s mile rail line 
the following table illustrates the royalty payment formula set forth in the mrc lease 
monthly average fee net days royalty daily x payable to x tipping x in payment tonnage kaiser fee per ton operation average daily tonnage tipping fee percentage payable to kaiser  on all tonnage during applicable month   on first  tons  on balance during applicable month   on all tonnage during applicable month   on all tonnage during applicable month determined over the number of operating days in a calendar month 
the company s revenues under the mrc lease will be directly affected by the amount of tonnage accepted at the landfill project and the applicable tipping fees charged for such tonnage 
the amount of tonnage depends upon mrc s ability to obtain contracts with municipalities and waste haulers for the receipt  transfer and disposal of solid waste 
mrc has not  to date  obtained any contract for the transfer or disposal of solid waste  although mrc is undertaking limited marketing efforts to seek such contracts 
however  there are no assurances that mrc will be able to secure contracts for sufficient waste tonnage to make the landfill project successful 
disposal costs consist principally of tipping fees and transportation costs associated with the hauling of waste to the landfill 
tipping fees currently vary widely among landfills  partly as a result of real and perceived landfill capacity shortages in areas  pending closure deadlines and partly as a result of increased costs of construction  operation and or closure 
tipping fees do not include transportation costs  which may vary significantly depending upon such factors as distance to the landfill and method of handling the waste 
it is unknown at this time if disposal costs in southern california will sufficiently increase as to make the eagle mountain landfill attractive to those controlling the disposal of waste 
see the discussion on disposal fees below 
government regulation permitting 
the design  operation and closure of solid waste landfills are subject to stringent federal  state and local environmental regulations 
these regulations  among other things  require upgraded or new composite landfill liners  leachate collection and treatment  groundwater and methane gas monitoring  stricter siting and location criteria  closure requirements and financial assurances such as a surety bond from the owner or operator 
the eagle mountain landfill is designed to meet or exceed these and all other applicable requirements 
in order to construct and operate the landfill project  mrc is required to obtain and maintain numerous government permits and approvals relating to such matters as land use compatibility  groundwater protection  air quality emissions  habitat protection  and rodent  pest and litter controls 
the process for obtaining these permits and approvals is often difficult  expensive and time consuming  particularly because the siting of landfills is a highly political issue and often draws opposition from environmental groups and local residents 
by way of background  before any significant regulatory permit may be granted relating to the construction and operation of the landfill project  an eir eis must be certified and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies 
in october  the riverside county board of supervisors approved the eir for the landfill project and mrc s local land use applications 
legal challenges to the certification of the eir were mounted in late by a number of individuals  a conservation group and eagle crest energy company ecec  formerly known as eagle mountain energy company  which is a potential competitor for the use of a portion of the landfill project site 
in july  the san diego county superior court issued its decisions on the challenges to the eir for the landfill project 
the court announced that it had eight areas of concern in which the eir was deficient  thus requiring corrective action 
as a result of the court s determinations  the court set aside and declared void the riverside county board of supervisors eir certification and all riverside county approvals rendered in connection with the eir certification 
the court ordered activities related to the development of the landfill suspended and directed the preparation of a new final environmental impact report in compliance with applicable law and the court s conclusions 
mrc and the company disagreed with many of the court s conclusions and initially took steps to appeal the decisions  but later withdrew their appeal to focus their efforts on re permitting the landfill project 
approval by riverside county of the landfill project 
in march  mrc initiated the necessary re permitting process by filing its land use applications with riverside county and has worked with the county and blm in the preparation of a new eir eis 
the draft eir eis was made available to the public in july  with the comment period on the draft eir eis closing in september the blm held public hearings on the draft eir eis and received extensive public comment 
in addition  by the close of the public comment period in september  numerous written comments were received 
the new final eir eis was released to the public in january  and received final approval from the riverside board of supervisors  by a vote of  on september in addition  the development agreement for the landfill project and related land use matters were also approved by the board of supervisors 
the landfill project is approved to receive up to  tons per day days a week of non hazardous municipal solid waste 
however  mrc is limited during the first ten years of operations to  tons per day of non county waste plus the waste generated from within the county 
after ten years  mrc may request an increase in daily tonnage up to the maximum of  tons  but such increase must be reviewed by and receive the approval of an independent scientific panel as discussed in more detail below 
eir litigation and appeal 
after the september approval of the new environmental impact report for the landfill project  the project eir  the litigation with respect to the project eir resumed 
in february  judge judith mcconnell of the same san diego county superior court issued its final ruling with respect to the litigation before her on the new project eir 
judge mcconnell  in her final ruling  found that the new project eir remained inadequate in evaluating the landfill project s impacts in two general areas i the threatened desert tortoise  and ii impacts to joshua tree national park 
mrc  the company  and riverside county appealed the superior court s decision 
project opponents did not appeal any matter 
on may   the court of appeal announced its decision to completely reverse the san diego superior court s prior adverse decision 
the court of appeal s decision in effect certified the project eir and reinstated riverside county s approval of the landfill project 
the court of appeal concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the decision of the riverside county board of supervisors to approve the landfill project in september  and that the san diego superior court had improperly substituted its judgment in concluding that the project eir was defective 
in june  opponents to the landfill project requested that the california supreme court review and overturn the court of appeal s decision 
in july  the california supreme court declined to review the court of appeal s decision 
in connection with the landfill project s eir litigation  project opponents also filed a motion with the san diego superior court seeking the award of approximately  in attorneys fees against mrc  the company and riverside county 
total fees and costs ultimately awarded to landfill opponents was approximately  the award of attorneys fees has been appealed 
a decision on the attorneys fees appeal is anticipated by the end of federal land exchange and land exchange litigation 
on october   the company s wholly owned subsidiary  kaiser eagle mountain  inc  completed a land exchange with the blm 
completion of the land exchange was a necessary step for completion of the permitting of the landfill project 
by way of background  since the commencement of permitting of the landfill project  the company has been seeking to transfer to the blm approximately  acres of kaiser owned property along its railroad right of way  which was identified as prime desert tortoise habitat  in exchange for fee ownership of approximately  acres of land within the landfill project area 
subsequent to the approval of the new joint eir eis  the blm originally issued a record of decision approving the land exchange  but such decision was ultimately withdrawn while the blm together with riverside county completed a new joint eir eis as discussed above 
in september  the blm issued a record of decision approving the proposed land exchange as well as the grant of new rights of way to replace existing rights of way 
a number of protests to the land exchange were received  which protests were denied by the blm in december as anticipated in january  the same two opponents in the eir litigation discussed above filed an appeal with the interior board of land appeals ibla challenging the blm s decision to proceed with the land exchange 
on september   the ibla issued its decision upholding the decision of the blm to engage in the proposed land exchange with the company 
this positive decision paved the way for completion of the land exchange on october  specifically  as a result of the land exchange the company received fee ownership of various non fee mining interests currently held by the company near the large open pits and the termination of a contingent reversionary interest associated with the eagle mountain townsite 
the new rights of way had been granted to the company earlier since they were not stayed by the earlier appeal of the land exchange 
with the land exchange completed  the eagle mountain site consists of approximately  acres with  acres held in fee which includes the eagle mountain townsite and approximately  acres held as various mining claims 
subsequent to the completion of the land exchange  two lawsuits were filed challenging the land exchange and requesting its reversal 
to date  no immediate injunctive relief has been sought 
these two lawsuits generally involve the same parties that were the plaintiffs in the unsuccessful state ceqa litigation and the unsuccessful appeals before the ibla 
it is anticipated that these two lawsuits filed in the federal district court located in riverside  california will be consolidated

permitting 
with the positive appellate decision on the new project eir land  mrc resumed seeking the final technical permits for the landfill project 
on september   the california regional water quality control board lower colorado basin region  unanimously approved the waste discharge requirements permit for the landfill project 
the grant of this permit was appealed to the california water resources board by one of the opponents to the landfill project 
a stay on the issuance of the permit was also being sought 
this appeal and the stay request were denied in december on december   the california integrated waste management board voted unanimously to approve and concur in the issuance of the solid waste facilities permit 
with the receipt of this facilities permit  the landfill project had received all of the major permits and approvals required for siting  constructing  and operating the landfill project 
mrc is now in a position to commence the detailed final engineering design of the landfill project and to increase its marketing efforts for the landfill project 
the development agreement 
as a part of the process of considering the landfill project  the company and mrc negotiated a development agreement with riverside county 
in summary  the development agreement to be executed among riverside county  mrc  the company  and two of the company s subsidiaries  kaiser eagle mountain  inc and eagle mountain reclamation  inc  provides the mechanism by which mrc acquires long term vested land use rights for a landfill and generally governs the relationship among the parties to the agreement 
the development agreement also addresses such items as the duties and indemnification obligations to riverside county  the extensive financial assurances to be provided to riverside county  the reservation and availability of landfill space for waste generated within riverside county  and events of default and remedies as well as a number of other items 
in addition  the financial payments to  or for the benefit of riverside county and others  are detailed in the development agreement and in the purchase and sale agreement  which is a part of the development agreement 
the purchase and sale agreement requires a per ton payment on non county waste determined from a base rate which is the greater of per ton or ten percent of the landfill tip fee up to  tons of non county waste 
the number increases to for all non county waste once non county waste exceeds  tons per day 
the per ton payment to the county also increases as volume increases 
the per ton payments on non county waste to riverside county are summarized as follows average tons per day of non county waste payment to riverside county  greater of once volume exceeds  tpd or base   base plus 
  base   base   base other major payments include i partial funding for up to four rail crossings with million due at the commencement of construction of the landfill and an additional million over the course of landfill operations  ii financial assistance for the host community  lake tamarisk  comprised of  due at the commencement of construction of the landfill plus an additional approximately million due over the course of landfill operations  and iii funding for non california environmental quality act reduction air emission programs of  over the course of operations 
the initial term of the development agreement is fifty years 
however  the term can be extended to november  in order to obtain an increase in the initial year term of the development agreement and or an increase in the initial  tons per day limit on out of county waste  an independent scientific panel will be convened to review such a request 
the scientific panel will be made up of five independent scientists and engineers selected by the university of california riverside the university with the approval of the company and mrc 
if the university and the company mrc are unable to agree on the panel members  two members are to be selected by the university  two by the company mrc and the fifth member is to be selected by the other four members 
alternative procedures are in place in the event the university does not participate in the selection of the panel members for any reason 
the panel will conduct its review within eight months of any request for capacity expansion 
the panel  in effect  is to limit its review to confirming that mrc has substantially complied with all development approvals  the environmental mitigation measures and all regulatory permits and that the potential environmental impacts of the landfill are the same as identified in the eir 
various appeal procedures are available depending upon the initial and final findings of the panel 
environmental trust fund 
pursuant to the terms of the development agreement and other related documents  
of the per ton payment made to riverside county by mrc on out of county municipal solid waste will be deposited into an environmental trust 
in addition  mrc directly pays 
per ton into the environmental trust for in county waste deposited into the landfill 
funds in the environmental trust are to be used within riverside county for a the protection  acquisition  preservation  and restoration of parks  open space  biological habitat  scenic  cultural  and scientific resources  b the support of environmental education and research  c the mitigation of the project s environmental impacts  and d the long term monitoring of the above mentioned items 
finally  mrc has agreed to pay 
per ton of municipal solid waste deposited into the landfill to the national parks foundation for the benefit of the national park service 
competition 
the solid waste disposal industry is highly competitive with a few large  integrated waste management firms and a significant number of smaller  independent operators 
the number of competitors have diminished  but their size has greatly increased as a result of mergers and acquisitions of waste hauler and management companies 
assuming the landfill project is ultimately constructed  the success of the landfill project depends largely upon mrc s ability to secure solid waste disposal contracts from municipalities and waste haulers in this highly competitive environment 
the ability of mrc to secure such waste disposal contracts is predicated upon a number of factors including  but not limited to  mrc s ability to i charge disposal fees comparable to those of its competitors  ii provide financial and environmental safeguards against potential liability  iii provide sufficient long term capacity  and iv commence operations prior to the expansion of existing landfills or the opening of other large capacity  rail haul landfills 
currently  there are over major existing municipal solid waste landfills in southern california serving the same geographic area as that proposed by the landfill project primarily los angeles  orange  riverside and san bernardino counties 
while a number of southern california landfills have closed and are scheduled to close in the next several years as they reach capacity  several of them  including el sobrante landfill in riverside county  mid valley sanitary landfill in san bernardino county  and sunshine canyon in los angeles county have received all or a portion of needed approvals for major expansions in the past couple of years 
other landfills such as puente hills in los angeles county are in the process of applying to expand the permitted capacities of their existing facilities 
the company is also currently aware of at least two other enterprises seeking to develop rail haul  solid waste disposal facilities which would be located in southern california and would compete directly with the landfill project 
these proposed cut and fill landfills include i a landfill to be developed in a desert site in san bernardino county by rail cycle of los angeles  a joint venture between waste management  inc now owned by usa waste and the santa fe railway company  inc  and ii mesquite regional landfill owned by goldfields mining corporation and its subsidiary arid operations  inc  to be developed in imperial county 
however  for the reasons discussed below  only the mesquite regional landfill project is currently believed by management of the company to be a viable california rail hail competitor 
the rail cycle project is contingent upon the approval of a business tax by the voters  which has failed once 
in addition  the rail cycle project and certain associated personnel also have been the subject of a criminal grand jury investigation which has altered the prospects of this particular project as currently being a viable competitor 
the mesquite regional landfill project has reported that it has received all of its major permits and should soon be able to commence construction and is a viable rail haul competitor 
in addition  the mesquite landfill project is targeting many of the same customers that mrc also believes are potential customers for the landfill project competition also extends to rail haul landfills in the states of arizona  utah and washington 
in utah  east carbon development corp 
operates a rail haul landfill capable of receiving waste from southern california and it is actively marketing its services to waste generators in southern california 
in addition  bfi  the former majority shareholder of mrc  operates a landfill in la paz county  arizona  with planned rail access  which will compete for southern california waste 
to a lesser extent  the landfill project will also compete with alternatives to landfills  such as recycling and alternative technology projects 
disposal fees 
while the company believes that it will take several years for mrc s projected disposal fees to be aligned at competitive levels with other urban landfills  it also currently believes that the advantages afforded by the eagle mountain site should enable it  in the long term  to compete effectively with both existing and other proposed landfills 
several years ago there was a general reduction in disposal or tipping fees in several areas of southern california 
the reduction in tipping fees was accelerated with the bankruptcy of orange county  california 
as a means of generating revenue  orange county reduced its tipping fee to out of county trash from to as low as per ton depending upon the length of the time commitment 
trash generated within orange county still pays approximately per ton tipping fee 
riverside county also adopted a two tier tipping fee structure 
the tipping fee would generally be for direct haul to a landfill and if the waste is processed through a transfer station or materials recycling facility 
facing the loss of waste from its system  san bernardino county dropped its tipping fee from per ton to per ton for fifteen year commitments 
in addition  the los angeles sanitation district with its puente hills landfill is a low cost provider of landfill space by charging a tipping fee of approximately per ton 
marketing 
as a result of the litigation successes  completion of the federal land exchange  and the landfill project s receipt of its last major permit  mrc is accelerating its efforts to make rail haul landfills a reality and to market the landfill project 
mrc has had meetings with several governmental agencies about the possibility of participating in the landfill project through the purchase of air or capacity rights or other similar arrangements 
these entities include  but are not limited to  the los angeles sanitation district 
in fourth quarter of  the los angeles sanitation district publicly stated that it has an interest in pursuing a possible transaction  including a possible purchase transaction  with respect to the landfill project and or with respect to the competing mesquite regional landfill project 
however  even though there are periodic discussions with the los angeles sanitation district and others  there is no assurance that any discussions will ultimately lead to an agreement with regard to the landfill project or as to the timing or terms of any agreement if one is ultimately negotiated 
risk factors 
as discussed throughout this k report  there are numerous risks associated with rail haul landfills  mrc and the landfill project which must be overcome to achieve the financing  permitting  construction  opening  and operation of the landfill project 
there have been and will continue to be opponents to the landfill project 
given the legal challenges that have occurred to date and the controversies that generally surround landfill projects  legal challenges in addition to the current legal challenges are likely 
the success of the landfill project also depends upon the development of the anticipated shortage in landfill capacity in southern california over the next several years 
in addition  mrc and the landfill project will encounter intense competition in the pricing and rendering of services from various sources in all phases of its solid waste disposal operations 
in the solid waste transportation and disposal phase  competition is encountered for the most part from regional disposal facilities  as well as from municipalities which may be able to provide such services at lower direct charges to customers than can mrc 
there is no assurance that rail haul landfills will be a viable alternative to other means of disposing municipal solid waste 
furthermore  as previously discussed  the mesquite regional landfill is a viable competitor which could materially adversely impact the chances of success of the landfill project 
there is no assurance that the company is currently able or will be able to compete effectively with current and anticipated landfill space  pricing competition or that other forms of competition will not result 
there is also a risk that sufficient and suitable financing may not be made available to mrc in order to allow it to continue to pursue the landfill project 
finally  the waste management industry has become subject to extensive  expensive and evolving regulation by federal  state and local authorities which becomes increasing stringent 
the company and mrc will make a continuing effort to anticipate regulatory  political and legal developments that might impact the landfill project  but they may not be able to do so 
given all these risks  there is no assurance that mrc and the landfill project will be viable or will be constructed or that once constructed  it will be commercially viable and profitable

significant legal proceedings  including those which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition  are summarized as follows litigation eagle mountain landfill project litigation 
this litigation involved legal challenges to the eir for the landfill project certified by the riverside county board of supervisors in october these cases were heard in the san diego county superior court in the court s decisions required mrc to prepare a new eir  which was completed and certified in september the original litigation against the eir was resumed before judge judith mcconnell of the san diego county superior court 
in february  the san diego county superior court announced its final decision and concluded that the new eir was still deficient in two principal respects 
the court s two remaining areas of concern involve the threatened desert tortoise and joshua tree national park 
the superior court s decision was appealed 
on may   a unanimous three judge panel of the california court of appeal  th appellate district  division  completely overturned the prior adverse decision of the san diego superior court on the landfill project s environmental impact report 
the california supreme court on july   denied the opponents request that the court of appeal s decision be reviewed and overturned 
accordingly  landfill opponents have effectively exhausted their challenges under the california environmental quality act 
related to the eir litigation was the award of approximately  of attorneys fees to project opponents prior to the announcement of the court of appeal decision 
this matter has also been appealed  and all briefs have been filed 
a decision in the matter is anticipated by year end 
separately  opponents to the landfill project appealed to the california water board the issuance of the waste discharge requirements permit for the landfill project unanimously approved in september by the california regional water quality control board  lower colorado river basin 
a stay of the issuance of the permit was also sought 
the appeal and the stay request were denied in december in october  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  kaiser eagle mountain  inc  completed a land exchange with the u 
s 
bureau of land management blm 
this completed land exchange has been challenged in two separate federal lawsuits 
by way of background  for some time the company had planned to transfer to the blm approximately  acres of kaiser owned property along its railroad right of way  which was identified as prime desert tortoise habitat  in exchange for fee ownership of approximately  acres of land within the landfill project area 
in september  the blm approved the proposed land exchange 
a number of protests to the land exchange were received  which protests were denied by the blm in december as anticipated  in january  the same two opponents in the eir litigation discussed above filed an appeal with the interior board of land appeals ibla challenging the blm s decision to proceed with the land exchange 
on september   the ibla issued its decision upholding the decision of the blm to engage in the proposed land exchange with the company

during the third quarter of  the city of richmond  located in northern california  joined the company in federal litigation it commenced against several entities  alleging that the city was entitled to recover past and future environmental clean up costs associated with property owned by the city of richmond 
apparently  the property currently owned by richmond includes portions of world war ii era shipyard construction and demolition facilities 
it is alleged that the company s predecessor demolished ships for approximately a two year period in the s and thus  contributed to the contamination of the property 
litigation was commenced against the city of richmond in the us bankruptcy court for the district of colorado to hold the city of richmond and certain officials in contempt for violating the bankruptcy order 
subsequent to the commencement of the contempt proceeding  a settlement was reached whereby the city of richmond was allowed a late unsecured general creditor claim in the ksc bankruptcy estate

the company s liability  if any  is currently estimated to be less than  asbestos suits 
the company along with ksc are currently named in approximately forty active asbestos lawsuits 
the company and ksc have been previously named in other asbestos suits but for various reasons those suits are not currently being pursued 
most of the plaintiffs alleged that they worked in shipyards in the oakland san francisco  california area in the s and that ksc was in some manner associated with one or more shipyards or has successor liability from another kaiser entity 
most of these lawsuits are third party premises claims claiming injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and involve multiple defendants 
the company anticipates that it will be named as a defendant in additional asbestos lawsuits 
virtually of the complaints are non specific 
as such it is not practical at this time to determine the true nature and extent of the claims against the company and ksc 
to date  several  but not all  of the plaintiffs have agreed that they will not personally pursue the company  but they have been granted the right to pursue the company s insurance coverage  to the extent there is coverage 
the company currently believes that it does have insurance coverage for at least a portion of the claims and has tendered these suits for defense 
the company also currently believes that it has various defenses to these claims  including the discharge granted to it in connection with ksc s bankruptcy reorganization 
the ksc bankruptcy estate  through ksc recovery has been incurring defense costs  which should in large part be reimbursed by insurance 
however  there currently is a dispute as to the amount of insurance coverage 
the company and ksc recovery are engaged in settlement negotiations with insurance carriers with regard to the coverage dispute 
asbestos litigation is an evolving area of the law and the factual discovery with respect to many of these lawsuits has not been completed

in sum  the complaint alleges that a plume or plumes containing organic carbon  dissolved solids and mercury originating from the company s mill site property due to activities of ksc and or a former tenant of the mill site property have impacted one of the city of ontario s water wells 
ontario seeks reimbursement for remedial costs  replacement of the allegedly impacted well and replacement or improvement or refurbishment of related facilities

in april  ontario brought a declaratory judgment action in the us district court for the district of colorado in bankruptcy the us bankruptcy court against the company  city of ontario v 
kaiser ventures inc  adversary proceeding no 
msk 
in the us bankruptcy court action  ontario in effect sought a determination that the matters and damages alleged in its california lawsuit were not discharged as a part of the ksc bankruptcy proceedings 
the company and the city reached a settlement concerning the matter before the us bankruptcy court which was approved by the us bankruptcy court in october 
under the terms of the settlement  the company has agreed to waive its bankruptcy related defenses to the city s prosecution of claims for groundwater contamination caused by mercury or other priority pollutants 
in return  the city agreed to dismiss the california litigation as to all claims related to total dissolved solids  total dissolved carbons and sulfates  and to be bound by the settlement agreement between kaiser and the california regional water quality control board 
the city has informed the company that its well tests do not currently indicate the presence of mercury 
however  the city continues to assert that the company is responsible for the impact of total dissolved solids at the well

bankruptcy claims the company s predecessor  ksc  was in reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code from february until november pursuant to the ksc plan of reorganization the ksc plan  the company established a subsidiary  ksc recovery  which was engaged in the process of pursuing certain legal actions on behalf of the former creditors of ksc and handling the remaining administrative duties of the ksc bankruptcy estate  including claims resolution 
all litigation and bankruptcy administration costs are borne by ksc recovery  which maintains a cash reserve from previous litigation and other recoveries to fund anticipated ongoing litigation and administration costs 
all major remaining claims in the bankruptcy estate were settled in  with completion of one major settlement occurring in resolution of these claims allowed for a distribution of cash and stock to most of the unsecured creditors of the ksc bankruptcy estate in the second quarter of consistent with ksc recovery s role solely as an agent of the former ksc creditors  the company s consolidated statements of operations and cash flows do not reflect any of ksc recovery s activities 
because of the minimum activities of the ksc bankruptcy estate  the bankruptcy court terminated its supervision over the estate in october however  the bankruptcy estate was reopened in to address certain litigation matters 
from time to time  various other environmental and similar types of claims  such as the environmental and asbestos litigation mentioned above  that relate to ksc pre bankruptcy activities are asserted against ksc recovery and the company 
in connection with the ksc plan  the company  as the reorganized successor to ksc  was discharged from all liabilities that may have arisen prior to confirmation of the ksc plan  except as otherwise provided by the ksc plan and by law 
although the company believes that in general all pre petition claims were discharged under the ksc plan  in the event any of these claims or other similar claims are ultimately determined to survive the ksc bankruptcy  it could have a material adverse effect on the company

subsequent to the merger  the company liquidated its investment in isc common stock over a period of three months at an average price of per share 
there was a  increase in the company s investments in wvmrf during the increase is due to the company s recording of its equity share of wvmrf s income during of  being partially offset by the receipt of a distribution of  other assets 
the increase in other assets  is primarily related to a capitalized landfill permitting and development costs incurred by mrc  b capital improvements at the mill site and eagle mountain  and c creation of a long term deferred tax asset  being partially offset by an increase in accumulated depreciation as of december   and the amortization of deferred loan fees environmental remediation 
as is discussed extensively in part i  item business property redevelopment  mill site environmental  the company estimates  based upon current information  that its future remediation and other environmental costs for the balance of its land and related matters  including groundwater and other possible third party claims  will be between approximately million and million  depending both upon the ultimate extent of the environmental remediation and clean up effort involved and which approved remediation alternatives are eventually selected 
as of december   the total short term and long term environmental liabilities including remediation reflected on the company s balance sheet were approximately million  the high end of the probable range of future remediation and other environmental costs  which declined from the million as of december  the decrease is a result of the million in remediation and other environmental costs incurred during on the mill site property 
although ongoing environmental investigations are being conducted on the mill site property and management believes it is currently in a position to estimate with some reasonable certainty future investigation and remediation costs  there can be no assurance that the actual amount of environmental remediation expenditures to be incurred will not substantially exceed those currently anticipated or that additional areas of contamination may not be identified 
accordingly  future facts and circumstances could cause these estimates to change significantly 
in addition  under the terms of the proposed sale of virtually all the mill site property  all environmental liabilities  with limited exceptions  assumed by the buyer of the property 
long term debt 
as of december   the company had no long term debt as a result of the payoff of  of previous borrowings under the company s  revolving to term credit facility with union bank during december other long term liabilities 
the decrease in other long term liabilities is primarily due to a the reclassification of  of the environmental remediation reserve from a current to a long term liability which was offset by  in environmental remediation activities undertaken during  b a decrease in deferred tax liabilities  and c a decrease in accrued liabilities 
minority interest and other liabilities

kaiser ventures inc 
and subsidiaries impact of the year issue 
the company successfully achieved compliance with the year requirements and year related issues had no material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
however  no assurance can be given that unforeseen problems may not occur in the future that may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
section business outlook the statements contained in this business outlook are based upon current operations and expectations 
in addition to the forward looking statements and information contained elsewhere in this k report  these statements are forward looking and  therefore  actual results may differ materially 
on going operations 
as noted above  the company s revenues from ongoing operations are generally derived from the development of the company s major long term projects and investments 
the development of a number of these projects and investments  such as the year take or pay lease with cucamonga  and the equity ownership of the west valley mrf  are essentially complete and the company is recognizing significant revenues and income from these investments 
the company anticipates revenues from these projects and investments to increase moderately over time as certain key economic factors impacting these projects and investments increase 
in addition  the company continues to evaluate these completed projects and investments in light of how to best provide maximum value to its shareholders 
in regard to the lease with cucamonga  the most significant economic factor affecting future water lease revenues is likely to be adjustments in the mwd rate for untreated and non interruptible water as available through the chino basin municipal water district now called inland empire utilities agency the lease rate upon which the lease payments are currently calculated 
the mwd rate established for untreated  non interruptible water is based on a number of factors  including mwd s need for funds to finance capital improvements and to cover large fixed overhead costs 
after increasing at an average of over per year during the past years  mwd is projecting that the mwd rate for untreated  non interruptible water  including all of the changed rates and charges implemented by mwd since july   will likely increase at less than per year for the next years 
this reduction is due to a reduced capital budget  lower overhead  lower borrowing costs and reduced levels of inflation 
also affecting the company s future water lease revenues is the dispute with cucamonga regarding the calculation of the lease rate 
in march  the san bernardino superior court ruled that the lease rate had been discontinued as of july  therefore  the terms of the cucamonga lease require the parties to seek to negotiate in good faith a new substitute rate 
if the parties are unable to agree on a substitute rate  the matter is to be resolved by reference  a form of private trial similar to arbitration 
before and after the trial  there were sporadic attempts to resolve the litigation and negotiate a new substitute rate 
however  since the parties were not able to reach a resolution of the matter  the matter will be determined as a result of a reference proceeding as required under the terms of the cucamonga lease 
the reference proceeding commenced during the week of february  after the conclusion of all the testimony in the proceeding  the court asked for further briefing and scheduled a final oral argument which is currently scheduled for may  a decision from the judge is expected within days thereafter 
with regard to the company s investment in fontana union  the company purchased  in march  an additional shares of fontana union from western water company for approximately  or  per share 
the price per share reflects a substantial minority discount and also reflects the resolution of a legal dispute between the seller of the shares and the company 
the purchase of these additional shares  which are not covered by the take or pay lease with cucamonga  will assist in protecting the company s effective interest in fontana union  which is utilized in calculating the revenue under the take or pay lease with cucamonga 
kaiser ventures inc 
and subsidiaries in regard to the wvmrf  the most significant factor affecting the company s future equity income from the wvmrf is the expansion of the facility s capacity from  to  tons per day 
this expansion  which is anticipated to be completed in the fall of  will increase the processing facility by an additional  square feet and will provide for additional materials recovery sorting capacity 
the success of this expansion will depend heavily on the continuing closures of local landfills and the future construction  if any  of competing facilities 
the company has historically spent a significant amount of capital in the development of its two other major project and investment opportunities the re permitting of the eagle mountain landfill by mrc  the company s owned subsidiary  and the redevelopment of approximately acres gross of the company s mill site property 
as a result of the litigation successes  completion of the federal land exchange  and the landfill project s receipt of its last major permit  mrc is accelerating its efforts to make rail haul landfills a reality and to market the landfill project 
mrc has had meetings with several governmental agencies about the possibility of participating in the landfill project through the purchase of air or capacity rights or other similar arrangements 
these entities include  but are not limited to  the los angeles sanitation district 
in fourth quarter of  the los angeles sanitation district publicly stated that it has an interest in pursuing a possible transaction  including a possible purchase transaction  with respect to the landfill project and or with respect to the competing mesquite regional landfill project 
however  even though there are periodic discussions with the los angeles sanitation district and others  there is no assurance that any discussions will ultimately lead to an agreement with regard to the landfill project or as to the timing or terms of any agreement if one is ultimately negotiated 
in regard to the redevelopment of approximately acres gross of the mill site property  the company completed the entitlement and permits process for a substantial portion of the property in april  for a variety of possible commercial  industrial and recreational uses 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a contract to sell substantially all of its remaining mill site property 
due to the extensive amount of due diligence and the number of contingencies involved  it is currently estimated that  if this transaction is consummated  it will close in the second quarter of based on this potential sale the company is not currently spending significant capital on the mill site 
should this transaction ultimately fail to be consummated  it is anticipated that the company would spend approximately million for required environmental remediation and approximately  for real estate entitlement and improvement expenditures over the remainder of the million to be spent in for required environmental remediation is a component of the million estimate to complete all remaining required remediation for the mill site property 
as previously disclosed  the company has recorded a write down to net realizable value on the mill site property in anticipation of this or a similar transaction closing  thus the company will not recognize a significant gain on the sale of the mill site property 
although neither the company nor any subsidiary of the company has any obligation to invest funds in mrc  the company has  to date  continued to make investments in mrc 
through a series of private placements with existing mrc shareholders  from july through december   a total of million has been raised by mrc  with kaiser contributing approximately million of that amount 
the company s advances approximated million out of a total funding of million 
the company has also approved advances to mrc totaling million for  which together with the minority shareholders advances are anticipated to fund mrc through december  capital resources 
the company expects that its current cash balances and short term investments together with a cash provided from operating activities  b amounts available under its  revolving to term credit facility less  reserved for financial assurances required by the dtsc and relating to environmental remediation on the mill site property will be sufficient to satisfy both the company s near term operating cash requirements and to enable the company to continue to fund the development of its long term projects and investments 
as was discussed in more detail above  the company expects to commit  in  a total of approximately million for capital projects and kaiser ventures inc 
and subsidiaries investments 
to the extent that additional capital resources are required  such capital will be raised through bank borrowings  partnerships  joint venture arrangements  additional equity or the sales or monetization of assets 
improved cash flow from use of net operating loss tax carryforwards 
due to the company s status as successor to ksc and its use of ksc related nols  income taxes actually paid by the company are substantially less than the income tax provision reported in its financial statements 
the tax benefit associated with the utilization of these nols is reflected as an increase to stockholders equity rather than as an increase to net income 
the company expects that its use of these nols will substantially reduce the cash paid for income taxes until these nols are fully utilized 
the total nols at december   are estimated to be approximately million for federal purposes 
these federal nols expire in varying amounts over a period from year to if within a three year period  or more of the stock of the company changes ownership  the future annual use of nols may be limited 
the annual limitation would be calculated as the product of i the highest long term tax exempt rate for a designated period prior to the ownership change  and ii the market value of the company at such time
