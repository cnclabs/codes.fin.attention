griffin s results include an allocation to griffin from culbro for corporate overhead of million prior to the distribution in july of that year 
this allocation  which may not necessarily reflect the additional expenses griffin would have incurred had it operated as a separate stand alone entity prior to the distribution  is deemed reasonable by griffin management

the culbro debt was included in griffin s financial statements through the first quarter  when that debt was assumed by gc holdings pursuant to the distribution agreement 
such interest expense has not been part of griffin s results of operations subsequent to the distribution

the new warehouse completed in is not mortgaged 
also in fiscal  griffin entered into a million revolving credit line the griffin credit agreement to replace the million revolving credit facility with imperial 
the griffin credit agreement is an unsecured facility that terminates in may and will provide financing for working capital requirements of griffin s landscape nursery and real estate businesses 
in the third quarter  imperial started several capital projects to improve and expand its containerized plant production facilities in florida and connecticut 
these projects are expected to be completed in fiscal at an estimated cost of approximately million 
additionally  imperial entered into an agreement to purchase land in central new jersey for a new wholesale sales and service center 
completion of the land purchase is contingent upon receiving all required regulatory approvals to operate a wholesale sales and service center on that site 
if such approval is received  expenditures for the land acquisition and required site work are projected to be approximately million in fiscal based on the future space requirements of certain of its tenants  griffin land may undertake construction of new buildings in fiscal to provide additional space  as needed 
a portion of any new construction may be built on speculation 
management believes that in the near term  based on the current level of operations and anticipated growth  its cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under the griffin credit agreement will be sufficient to finance the working capital requirements and expected capital expenditures of its landscape nursery business and fund development of its real estate assets 
over the intermediate and long term  selective mortgage placements or additional bank credit facilities may also be required to fund capital projects 
year in the fourth quarter  griffin completed all necessary remediation steps to ensure all its systems are year yk compliant 
subsequent to january   griffin has not encountered any problems with its computer systems as a result of the yk issue 
costs attributed to modifying griffin s systems to be yk compliant were less than million in the aggregate 
prior to december   griffin initiated a company wide review of major customers  vendors and other third parties to determine the extent  if any  to which griffin would be vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own yk issues 
those third parties contacted indicated that they had yk readiness programs in place or that they were yk compliant before december  subsequent to january   griffin has not encountered any yk problems from any of its critical business partners 
we will continue to monitor our critical business partners for yk issues 
griffin believes that its efforts to address the yk issue have been successful 
however  failure of critical third parties adequately to address their respective yk issues could have a material adverse effect on griffin s business  financial condition and results of operations 
therefore  griffin s program for yk compliance included the development of contingency plans for continuing operations in the event such problems arise 
however  there can be no assurance that such contingency plans will be adequate to handle all problems which may arise 
forward looking information the above information in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
although griffin believes that its plans  intentions and expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such plans  intentions or expectations will be achieved  particularly with respect to the opening of an additional sales and service center  the leasing of its warehouse constructed in and possible construction of additional facilities in the real estate business 
the forward looking information disclosed herein is based on assumptions and estimates that  while considered reasonable by griffin as of the date hereof  are inherently subject to significant business  economic  competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the control of griffin 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not earnings or cash flows 
griffin does not have an obligation to prepay any fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and therefore  interest rate risk and changes in the fair market value of fixed rate debt should not have a significant impact on earnings or cash flows until such debt is refinanced  if necessary 
for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
griffin did not have any variable rate debt outstanding at november   but is expected to have such debt outstanding in the future 
griffin is exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on market values of griffin s cash equivalent short term investments 
these investments generally consist of overnight investments that are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk  except to the extent that changes in interest rates will ultimately affect the amount of interest income earned and cash flow from these investments 
griffin does not currently have any derivative financial instruments in place to manage interest costs  but that does not mean that griffin will not use them as a means to manage interest rate risk in the future 
griffin does not use foreign currency exchange forward contracts or commodity contracts and does not have foreign currency exposure in its operations 
griffin does have investments in companies based in the united kingdom  and changes in foreign exchange rates could affect the results of equity investments in griffin s financial statements  and the ultimate liquidation of those investments and conversion of proceeds into united states currency
