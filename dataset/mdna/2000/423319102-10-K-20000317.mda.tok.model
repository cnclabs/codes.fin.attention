these risks and uncertainties include those described under certain factors that may affect future results below 
on may   the company acquired granville phillips company gpc

part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations compared with net sales for were million compared to million in  a decrease of million 
this decline was attributable to the excess capacity in the worldwide semiconductor industry  combined with the economic slump in the pacific rim

despite the decline in the semiconductor capital equipment business environment and the continued weakness of the asian markets  the company continued to fund its long term strategic development programs in in order to position the company for growth as economics improved in the worldwide semiconductor industry 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in to million from million in the prior year

certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission may contain statements that are forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to the company s shipment levels  profitability  business and industry outlook and sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements may be forward looking statements 
the words expect  anticipate  plan  believe  seek  estimate and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause the company s future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
many such factors are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
readers are accordingly cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether in part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued certain factors that may affect future results continued response to new information or future events or otherwise 
important factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
the company s business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which  in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns  which generally have had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment and have adversely affected the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that developments in the semiconductor industry or the semiconductor equipment industry will occur at the rate or in the manner expected by the company 
in addition to the cyclical nature  risks and uncertainties of the semiconductor industry  the company faces the following risks and uncertainties among others the need to continuously develop  manufacture and gain customers acceptance of new products and product enhancements  dependence on a limited number of customers and concentration of sales to one or a few customers  the company s ability to attract and retain certain key personnel  the ability of the company to protect its technology assets by obtaining and enforcing patents  and dependence on sole and limited source suppliers for certain components and subassemblies included in the company s products and systems 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in its future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially affect its business  financial position  results of operations and stock price 
year the year problem refers to the potential for information systems to be unable to correctly recognize and process calendar dates and date sensitive information involving dates on or after january  in  the company began to address its year risk within four categories internal business software  internal systems hardware and software  exclusive of business software  external suppliers of goods and services  and the company s products 
the company has not experienced any material year problems to date in any of these categories but will continue monitoring its year risk on an ongoing basis 
the company s total cost associated with addressing the year problem was approximately million 
of the total cost  approximately million relates to new systems and has been capitalized 
part ii item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and exchange rate risk a portion of the company s business is conducted outside the united states through its foreign subsidiaries 
the foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency rate fluctuations  the company has entered into forward exchange contracts on a continuing basis to hedge the currency exposures 
gains and losses on forward exchange contracts qualifying for hedge accounting were immaterial for years presented and were classified in cost of sales 
the company plans to continue to use forward exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
the notional amount of the company s outstanding foreign currency contracts at december   was  the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in forward currency exchange rates at december   would be  the potential loss was estimated calculating the fair value of the forward exchange contracts at december   and comparing that with the value calculated using the hypothetical forward currency exchange rates
