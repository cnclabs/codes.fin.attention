the company s revenues are derived primarily from sales of merchandise and gasoline at its convenience and discount tobacco stores 
these revenues increased substantially in fiscal year in comparison to fiscal year due to the april acquisition of convenience stores in northeastern pennsylvania and a increase in the average price per gallon of gasoline sold 
also  average annual merchandise sales for stores open two full years increased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year average gallons of gasoline sold at the company s stores open two full years were  gallons in fiscal year compared to  gallons in fiscal year and  gallons in fiscal year this merchandise sales growth trend is primarily the result of increased sales of fast food items and the addition of in store traffic enhancing services  such as the sale of lottery tickets  money orders and prepaid telephone cards  atms  and the acceptance of personal checks 
cigarette sales represented approximately of total merchandise sales in each of the last three fiscal years 
there has been volatility in selling prices as a result of competition among cigarette manufacturers 
since the company expects this trend to continue  it has sought increased sales of other merchandise to mitigate the volatility 
convenience stores selling gasoline have been heavily affected by environmental regulations  principally concerning underground storage tanks  which require large capital expenditures in order to achieve compliance 
in the late s  the company began making significant expenditures to meet  and exceed  applicable standards 
management believes that the company is currently in compliance with all applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations and expects minimum expenditures in fiscal year to maintain compliance 
in addition  the company has adopted a program to ensure that new gasoline installations comply with federal and state regulations 
the company terminated its relationship with getty petroleum corp 
getty and its affiliates during fiscal year the company is no longer required to purchase petroleum products from getty and no longer operates stores which were leased to the company by getty 
in fiscal year  these stores generated merchandise sales of million and sold million gallons of gasoline for total sales of million 
termination of the relationship with getty permits the company to purchase petroleum products from a variety of competing sources 
the company sells gasoline at locations  including one location where gasoline is sold on a commission basis 
branded gasoline is purchased under supply agreements for locations and unbranded gasoline is purchased from various sources for locations 
these arrangements provide for purchases of gasoline at cost levels which are less than those offered by getty 
however  gasoline margins have historically been volatile and there can be no assurance that the company s gasoline margins will be enhanced by purchasing such products from competitive sources 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain expense items to total revenues 
it should be noted that the primary factors influencing the percentage relationship of cost of sales to revenues are the volatility of gasoline prices  gross profits and a proportional increase in the number of stores selling gasoline

as a result  the company s daily operations do not generally require large amounts of working capital 
from time to time  the company utilizes substantial portions of its cash to acquire and construct new stores and renovate existing locations 
on april   the company terminated its million revolving loan agreement with a bank and repaid amounts outstanding under this facility with borrowings from a new million revolving loan agreement with another bank 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the terms of this new revolving loan facility on april   the company purchased most of the operating assets and business of orloski service station  inc and its owners collectively ossi for approximately million in cash and assumption of a gasoline supplier agreement 
in september  the company purchased an additional ossi property for approximately million 
ossi was the operator of a store chain of convenience stores and gasoline dispensing stations in northeastern pennsylvania 
this acquisition was financed with mortgage and equipment loans aggregating million 
the mortgages will be repaid over years and the equipment loans will be repaid over years 
also in fiscal year  the company had additional capital expenditures of million  of which million was financed with bank loans and  was financed with capital leases 
the balance was funded from cash flow from operations 
management believes that cash from operations and the available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s obligations for the foreseeable future 
capital requirements for debt service and capital leases for fiscal year are approximately million 
the company anticipates capital expenditures in fiscal year of million  for which the company has committed financing of million with the remainder funded from cash flow from operations 
these capital expenditures include construction of new stores  remodeling of stores  upgrades of store equipment and gasoline dispensing equipment and upgrading of the company s data processing systems 
impact of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
generally  increases in the company s cost of merchandise can be quickly reflected in higher prices of goods sold 
however  any upward movement of gasoline costs may have short term negative effects on profit margins  since the company s ability to raise gasoline prices can be limited due to competition from other self service gasoline outlets 
in addition  fluctuation of gasoline prices can limit the ability of the company to maintain stable gross margins
