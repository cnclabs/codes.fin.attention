this exposure is minimized by the limited investment maturities and put options available to the company as explained in the notes to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the impact of a hypothetical two percent increase or decrease in prevailing interest rates would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations
