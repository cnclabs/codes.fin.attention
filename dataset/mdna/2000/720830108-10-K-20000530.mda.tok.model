the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was primarily due to increased income after reflecting non cash items from the acquisition of pierre in june and the opening of thirteen new restaurants in fiscal  offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory at pierre  net of the increase in accounts payable 
the company had positive working capital at march  and march  of million and million  respectively  as compared to a working capital deficit of

the major components of financing activities in fiscal included the issuance of million principal amount of senior notes due the notes and initial borrowings under a five year  million revolving credit facility 
the proceeds of these financing activities were used to acquire pierre  extinguish all existing debt of the company  with the exception of outstanding industrial revenue bonds and certain lease obligations and repurchase  shares of the company s common stock 
as of march   the company had no outstanding borrowings under its million revolving credit facility due to the repayment of outstanding borrowings from the proceeds of the disposition of the restaurant segment 
at march   the company was not in compliance with the financial covenant relating to fixed charges under the agreement 
accordingly  the company had no availability for borrowings under this credit facility 
effective may   the company terminated its million revolving credit facility 
effective may   subject to certain closing conditions precedent  the company secured a new three year million revolving credit facility with a new lender 
upon final closing of the million revolving credit facility  the company will be able to borrow up to an amount including standby letters of credit up to million equal to the lesser of million less required minimum availability or a borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
funds available under the revolving credit facility will be available for working capital requirements  permitted investments and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at floating rates based upon the interest rate option selected from time to time by the company 
the borrowings will be secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the accounts receivable and inventory of the company 
in addition  the company will be required to meet certain financial covenants regarding net worth  cash flow and restricted payments  including limited dividend payments 
fiscal operating cash flows were not sufficient to provide necessary working capital and to service existing debt 
these cash requirements were instead satisfied with proceeds from asset sales 
to be certain of making its million semi annual note interest payment due june   on may   the company obtained its new million revolving credit facility  with availability subject to the satisfaction of certain routine closing conditions 
the company anticipates that its fiscal cash requirements for working capital and debt service will be met through a combination of funds provided by operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the company has budgeted approximately million for capital expenditures in fiscal these expenditures are devoted to routine food processing capital improvement projects and other miscellaneous expenditures and should be sufficient to maintain current operating capacity 
the company believes that funds from operations and funds from the million revolving credit facility  as well as the company s ability to enter into capital or operating leases  will be adequate to finance these routine capital expenditures 
if pierre continues its historical revenue growth trend as expected  then the company will be required to raise and invest additional capital for various plant expansion projects to provide operating capacity to satisfy increased demand 
the company believes that future cash requirements for these plant expansion projects would need to be met through other long term financing sources  such as an increase in borrowing availability under the million credit facility  the issuance of industrial revenue bonds or equity investment 
the incurrence of additional long term debt is governed and restricted by the company s existing debt instruments 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that additional long term financing will be available on advantageous terms or any terms when needed by the company 
the company anticipates continued sales growth in key market areas 
as noted above  however  this growth will require capital expansion projects to increase existing plant capacity to satisfy increased demand 
sales growth  improved operating performance and expanded plant capacity none of which is assured will be necessary for the company to continue to service existing debt 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations for fiscal  fiscal or fiscal the company does not expect inflation to have a material impact on its results of operations for fiscal seasonality except for sales to school districts  which decline significantly during the summer and early january  there is no seasonal variation in the company s sales of food products 
the company s food production is steady throughout the year

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks stemming from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company owned no derivative financial instruments or nonderivative financial instruments held for trading purposes at march   march  or february  certain of the company s outstanding nonderivative financial instruments at march  are subject to interest rate risk  but not subject to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
interest rate risk the company manages the potential loss on long term debt from changing interest rates by issuing a combination of fixed and variable rate debt in amounts and maturities that management considers appropriate 
of the company s long term debt outstanding at march   all principal amounts were accruing interest at fixed rates 
in the future  should the company borrow funds under the variable rate million revolving credit facility  a rise in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the following table summarizes the company s market risks associated with long term debt outstanding at march  the table presents principal cash outflows and related interest rates by maturity date 
march  expected maturities in fiscal years long term debt weighted average fixed rate interest rate thereafter  total  fair value  foreign exchange rate risk the company primarily bills customers in foreign countries in us dollars 
however  a significant decline in the value of currencies used in certain regions of the world as compared to the us dollar could adversely affect product sales in those regions because the company s products may be more expensive for those customers to pay for in their local currency 
at march   all trade receivables were denominated in us dollars 
commodity price risk certain raw materials used in food processing products are exposed to commodity price changes 
increases in the prices of certain commodity products could result in higher overall production costs 
the company manages this risk through purchase orders  non cancelable contracts and by passing on such cost increases to customers 
the company s primary commodity price exposures relate to beef  pork  poultry  soy and packaging materials used in food processing products 
at march   the company evaluated commodity pricing risks and determined it was not currently beneficial to use derivative financial instruments to hedge the company s current positions with respect to such pricing exposures 
fair value of financial instruments the company s nonderivative financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trade and note receivables  trade payables  and long term debt 
at march   excluding long term debt shown above  the book values of each of the nonderivative financial instruments recorded in the company s balance sheet are considered representative of fair value due to variable interest rates  short terms to maturity and or short length of time outstanding 
fair value of nonderivative financial instruments are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis  based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar nonderivative financial instruments
