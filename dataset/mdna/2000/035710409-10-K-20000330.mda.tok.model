item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a real estate investment trust that owns and manages a portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders from the spread between the interest income on our mortgage backed securities and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of mortgage backed securities 
we commenced operations on february  upon the consummation of a private placement 
we completed our initial public offering on october  the day period ended december  was a short operating period and not a full twelve months 
also  average assets for the period ended december  totaled million  whereas average assets for the year ended december  totaled billion 
as a result  the comparison of net income for the period ended february  and the year ended december  may show changes that may not be indicative of future periods 
results of operations for the years ended december  and net income summary for the year ended december   our gaap net income was million  or basic earnings per average share  as compared to million  or basic earnings per average share  for the year ended december  we compute our gaap net income per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of outstanding common stock during the period  which was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  dividends per weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year ended december  was per share  or million in total 
dividends per weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year ended december  was per share  or million in total 
our return on average equity was for the year ended december  and year ended december  net income summary year ended year ended december  december  interest income   interest expense   net interest income   gain on sale of mortgage backed securities  general and administrative expenses   net income   average number of basic shares outstanding   average number of diluted shares outstanding   basic net income per share diluted net income per share average total assets   average equity   annualized return on average assets annualized return on average equity taxable income and gaap income for the years ended december  and  our income as calculated for tax purposes taxable income differed from income as calculated according to gaap gaap income 
our taxable income for the year ended december  was approximately million  or per share  as compared to taxable income of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the differences were in the calculations of premium and discount amortization  gains on sale of mortgage backed securities  and general and administrative expenses 
the distinction between taxable income and gaap income is important to our stockholders because dividends are declared on the basis of taxable income 
while we do not pay taxes so long as we satisfy the requirements for exemption from taxation pursuant to the reit provisions of the internal revenue code  each year we complete a corporate tax form on which taxable income is calculated as if we were to be taxed 
this taxable income level determines the amount of dividends we can pay out over time 
the table below presents the major differences between our gaap and taxable income for the years ended december    and  and the four quarters in taxable income taxable general taxable taxable gain mortgage on sale of gaap net administrative amortization securities taxable net income differences differences differences income dollars in thousands for the year ended december    for the year ended december    for the period ended december    for the quarter ended december    for the quarter ended september    for the quarter ended june    for the quarter ended march    interest income and average earning asset yield we had average earning assets of billion for the year ended december  and our primary source of income for the years ended december  and was interest income 
a portion of our income was generated by gains on the sales of our mortgage backed securities 
our interest income was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  our yield on average earning assets was and for the same respective periods 
our average earning asset balance decreased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  interest income decreased by  for the year ended december  over prior year  the due to the slight decline in the average earning asset balance and yield 
the table below shows our average balance of cash equivalents and mortgage backed securities  the yields we earned on each type of earning assets  our yield on average earning assets and our interest income for the years ended december  and  and the period ended december   and the four quarters in average earning asset yield yield on average yield on average yield on average mortgage average average mortgage average cash backed earning cash backed earning interest equivalents securities assets equivalents securities assets income dollars in thousands for the year ended december     for the year ended december     for the period ended december     for the quarter ended december     for the quarter ended september     for the quarter ended june     for the quarter ended march     the constant prepayment rate or cpr on our mortgage backed securities for the year ended december  was and for the year ended december  was 
cpr is an assumed rate of prepayment for our mortgage backed securities  expressed as an annual rate of prepayment relative to the outstanding principal balance of our mortgage backed securities 
cpr does not purport to be either a historical description of the prepayment experience of our mortgage backed securities or a prediction of the anticipated rate of prepayment of our mortgage backed securities 
principal prepayments had a negative effect on our earning asset yield for the years ended december  and because we adjust our rates of premium amortization and discount accretion monthly based upon the effective yield method  which takes into consideration changes in prepayment speeds 
interest expense and the cost of funds we anticipate that our largest expense will be the cost of borrowed funds 
we had average borrowed funds of billion and total interest expense of million for the year ended december  we had average borrowed funds of billion and total interest expense of million for the year ended december  our average cost of funds was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the cost of funds rate declined and the average borrowed funds declined by million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december   consequently  interest expense decreased by 
with our current asset liability management strategy  changes in our cost of funds are expected to be closely correlated with changes in short term libor  although we may choose to extend the maturity of our liabilities at any time 
our average cost of funds was below one month libor for the year ended december  and equal to average one month libor for the year ended december  we generally have structured our borrowings to adjust with one month libor because we believe that one month libor may continue to be lower than six month libor in the present interest rate environment 
during the year ended december   average one month libor  which was  was lower than average six month libor  which was 
during the year ended december   average one month libor  which was  was higher than average six month libor  which was 
the table below shows our average borrowed funds and average cost of funds as compared to average one month and average six month libor for the years ended december  and  the period ended december  and the four quarters in average cost of funds average average average one month cost cost libor of funds of funds average relative to relative to relative to average average one average average average average borrowed interest cost of month six month six month one month six month funds expense funds libor libor libor libor libor dollars in thousands for the year ended december    for the year ended december    for the period ended december    for the quarter ended december    for the quarter ended september    for the quarter ended june    for the quarter ended march    net interest rate agreement expense we have not entered into any interest rate agreements to date 
as part of our asset liability management process  we may enter into interest rate agreements such as interest rate caps  floors or swaps 
these agreements would be entered into with the intent to reduce interest rate or prepayment risk and would be designed to provide us income and capital appreciation in the event of certain changes in interest rates 
however  even after entering into these agreements  we would still be exposed to interest rate and prepayment risks 
we review the need for interest rate agreements on a regular basis consistent with our capital investment policy 
net interest income our net interest income  which equals interest income less interest expense  totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  our net interest income increased because of lower funding costs for the year 
our net interest spread  which equals the yield on our average assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period  was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this increase in spread income is reflected in the million increase in net interest income 
net interest margin  which equals net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the principal reason that net interest margin exceeded net interest spread is that average interest earning assets exceeded average interest bearing liabilities 
a portion of our assets is funded with equity rather than borrowings 
we did not have any interest rate agreement expenses to date 
the table below shows our interest income by earning asset type  average earning assets by type  total interest income  interest expense  average repurchase agreements  average cost of funds  and net interest income for the years ended december  and  the period ended december   and the four quarters in gaap net interest income average interest yield on mortgage income on average average backed mortgage average total interest balance of average net securities backed cash interest earning repurchase interest cost interest held securities equivalents income assets agreements expense of funds income for the year ended december        for the year ended december        for the period ended december        for the quarter ended december        for the quarter ended september        for the quarter ended june        for the quarter ended march        gains and losses on sales of mortgage backed securities for the year ended december   we sold mortgage backed securities with an aggregate historical amortized cost of million for an aggregate gain of  for the year ended december   we sold mortgage backed securities with an aggregate historical amortized cost of million for an aggregate gain of million 
as stated above  our gain on the sale of assets declined substantially 
for the year ended december   there was a greater emphasis on spread income and not gains 
the difference between the sale price and the historical amortized cost of our mortgage backed securities is a realized gain and increases income accordingly 
we do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis  but may from time to time sell existing assets to move into new assets  which our management believes might have higher risk adjusted returns  or to manage our balance sheet as part of our asset liability management strategy 
credit losses we have not experienced credit losses on our mortgage backed securities to date 
we have limited our exposure to credit losses on our mortgage backed securities by purchasing only securities  issued or guaranteed by fnma  fhlmc or gnma  which  although not rated  carry an implied aaa rating 
general and administrative expenses g a expenses were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  g a expenses as a percentage of average assets was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
g a expenses increased by  for  when compared to salaries and benefits increased by  with the addition of one employee and higher benefits cost

as previously mentioned  the substantial decline in interest expense was the primary reason that our earnings increased

accordingly  we have distributed substantially all of our taxable income for each year since inception to our stockholders  including income resulting from gains on sales of our mortgage backed securities

all of the mortgage assets underlying these mortgage backed securities were secured with a first lien position on the underlying single family properties 
all our mortgage backed securities were fhlmc  fnma or gnma mortgage pass through certificates or cmos  which carry an implied aaa rating 
we mark to market all of our earning assets at liquidation value 
we accrete discount balances as an increase in interest income over the life of discount mortgage backed securities and we amortize premium balances as a decrease in interest income over the life of premium mortgage backed securities 
at december  and  we had on our balance sheet a total of million and  respectively  of unamortized discount which is the difference between the remaining principal value and current historical amortized cost of our mortgage backed securities acquired at a price below principal value and a total of million and million  respectively  of unamortized premium which is the difference between the remaining principal value and the current historical amortized cost of our mortgage backed securities acquired at a price above principal value 
we received mortgage principal repayments of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  given our current portfolio composition  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to increase over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would decrease during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would be required to amortize our net premium balance into income over a shorter time period 
similarly  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to decrease over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would increase during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would amortize our net premium balance over a longer time period

we have not entered into any interest rate agreements since our inception 
borrowings to date  our debt has consisted entirely of borrowings collateralized by a pledge of our mortgage backed securities 
these borrowings appear on our balance sheet as repurchase agreements 
at december   we had established uncommitted borrowing facilities in this market with twenty three lenders in amounts  which we believe  are in excess of our needs 
all of our mortgage backed securities are currently accepted as collateral for these borrowings 
however  we limit our borrowings  and thus our potential asset growth  in order to maintain unused borrowing capacity and thus increase the liquidity and strength of our balance sheet 
for the years ended december  and  the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to one year  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days at december  and days at december  at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
liquidity liquidity  which is our ability to turn non cash assets into cash  allows us to purchase additional mortgage backed securities and to pledge additional assets to secure existing borrowings should the value of our pledged assets decline 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for us include cash balances and unused borrowing capacity 
unused borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of our mortgage backed securities varies 
our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on going basis through mortgage principal repayments and net earnings held prior to payment as dividends 
should our needs ever exceed these on going sources of liquidity plus the immediate sources of liquidity discussed above  we believe that our mortgage backed securities could in most circumstances be sold to raise cash 
the maintenance of liquidity is one of the goals of our capital investment policy 
under this policy  we limit asset growth in order to preserve unused borrowing capacity for liquidity management purposes 
stockholders equity we use available for sale treatment for our mortgage backed securities  we carry these assets on our balance sheet at estimated market value rather than historical amortized cost 
based upon this available for sale treatment  our equity base at december  was million  or per share 
if we had used historical amortized cost accounting  our equity base at december  would have been million  or per share 
our equity base at december  was million  or per share 
if we had used historical amortized cost accounting  our equity base at december  would have been million  or per share 
during the year ended december   the company raised additional capital in the amount of million through its direct purchase program 
with our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in market values of assets do not impact our gaap or taxable income but rather are reflected on our balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
by accounting for our assets in this manner  we hope to provide useful information to stockholders and creditors and to preserve flexibility to sell assets in the future without having to change accounting methods 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
the table below shows unrealized gains and losses on the mortgage backed securities in our portfolio 
unrealized gains and losses dollars in thousands at december  at december  at december  unrealized gain    unrealized loss    net unrealized gain loss    net unrealized gain loss as of mortgage backed securities principal value net unrealized gain loss as of mortgage backed securities amortized cost unrealized changes in the estimated net market value of mortgage backed securities have one direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends positive market to market changes increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity while negative changes tend to limit borrowing capacity under our capital investment policy 
a very large negative change in the net market value of our mortgage backed securities might impair our liquidity position  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
unrealized losses on available for sale securities was million  or of the amortized cost of our mortgage backed securities at december  unrealized losses on available for sale securities was million or of the amortized cost of our mortgage backed securities at december  the table below shows our equity capital base as reported and on a historical amortized cost basis at december    and  and september   june  and march  issuances of common stock  the level of gaap earnings as compared to dividends declared  and other factors influence our historical cost equity capital base

we generally expect to maintain a ratio of debt to equity of between and  although the ratio may vary from this range from time to time based upon various factors  including our management s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities  our liquidity position  our level of unused borrowing capacity and over collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge assets to secure borrowings 
our target debt to gaap reported equity ratio is determined under our capital investment policy 
should our actual debt to equity ratio increase above the target level due to asset acquisition or market value fluctuations in assets  we will cease to acquire new assets 
our management will  at that time  present a plan to our board of directors to bring us back to our target debt to equity ratio  in many circumstances  this would be accomplished in time by the monthly reduction of the balance of our mortgage backed securities through principal repayments 
asset liability management and effect of changes in interest rates we continually review our asset liability management strategy with respect to interest rate risk  mortgage prepayment risk  credit risk and the related issues of capital adequacy and liquidity 
we seek attractive risk adjusted stockholder returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet 
we seek to manage the extent to which our net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable rate assets with variable rate borrowings 
in addition  although we have not done so to date  we may seek to mitigate the potential impact on net income of periodic and lifetime coupon adjustment restrictions in our portfolio of mortgage backed securities by entering into interest rate agreements such as interest rate caps and interest rate swaps 
changes in interest rates may also have an effect on the rate of mortgage principal prepayments and  as a result  prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
we will seek to mitigate the effect of changes in the mortgage principal repayment rate by balancing assets we purchase at a premium with assets we purchase at a discount 
to date  the aggregate premium exceeds the aggregate discount on our mortgage backed securities 
as a result  prepayments  which result in the expensing of unamortized premium  will reduce our net income compared to what net income would be absent such prepayments 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our dividends based upon our net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
other matters we calculate that our qualified reit assets  as defined in the internal revenue code  are of our total assets at december  and  as compared to the internal revenue code requirement that at least of our total assets be qualified reit assets 
we also calculate that and of our revenue qualifies for the source of income test  and of its revenue qualifies for the source of income test  under the reit rules for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income 
therefore  as of december  and  we believe that we qualified as a reit under the internal revenue code 
we at all times intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act 
if we were to become regulated as an investment company  then our use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate qualifying interests 
under current interpretation of the staff of the sec  in order to qualify for this exemption  we must maintain at least of our assets directly in qualifying interests 
in addition  unless certain mortgage securitites represent all the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages  the mortgage backed securities may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the requirement 
we calculate that as of december  and we were in compliance with this requirement 
item 
a quantitative and qualitiative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of our mortgage backed securities and our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets 
we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of interest rates on our operations 
if we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  we may be subject to certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments 
to date  we have not purchased any hedging instruments 
our profitability and the value of our portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and portfolio value should interest rates go up or down basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
projected percentage change in projected percentage change in change in interest rate net interest income portfolio value basis points basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points basis points asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
we attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of our interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities  except adjustable rate loans  and securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature 
mortgage backed securities reflect estimated prepayments that were estimated based on analyses of broker estimates  the results of a prepayment model that we utilized and empirical data 
our management believes that these assumptions approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in the table could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which the assumptions are based

these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our management may produce results that differ significantly form the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in the above tables and in this report
