item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
background presstek  inc the company or presstek  incorporated in delaware  was founded in september as a development company 
it was established to find a new way to produce color offset printing 
heidelberger druckmaschinen ag heidelberg  the world s largest printing press manufacturer  and the company established a relationship that was formalized in in the company completed the development of its high resolution  semiconductor based laser diode imaging and thermal plate technology referred to as pearl r 
pearl s thermal laser imaging technology enables its customers to image various types of presstek printing plates either off press or on press which may then be used to produce high quality  full color lithographic printed materials for the printing and graphic arts industries 
these printed materials typically can be produced at a lower cost than traditional competitive methods 
the pearl based gto di was introduced in late  and in may of  heidelberg introduced the quickmaster di 
the quickmaster di design is centered around presstek s digital imaging and plate technology  and includes the company s patented automatic plate changing cylinder 
the unique design feeds plates from inside the cylinder  eliminating the need to manually change plates between jobs 
the company began shipment of its pearl based quickmaster direct imaging systems to heidelberg in the second quarter of the company estimates that as of the end of  there are more than  pearl equipped gto di and quickmaster di presses installed utilizing the company s proprietary consumable printing plates 
the company is also engaged in the development of additional pearl and di r products that incorporate its patented  proprietary  digital imaging system and process free thermal ablation printing plate technologies for computer to plate and direct to press applications 
during fiscal  the company began shipments of its pearl platesetter  referred to as the pearlsetter 
the pearlsetter is a computer to plate imaging system that images both the company s wet and dry offset plates 
also in  the company began shipments of its direct imaging system for a larger format adast x multicolor press  the adast c di series of presses 
in fiscal the company began shipments of its pearlhdp laser imaging system 
the pearlhdp  jointly developed with imation corp  is a digital halftone  proofing device 
it can produce true halftone dot for dot color press proofs using the company s computer to plate imaging system specially modified for this unique application 
the company has entered into a comprehensive agreement whereby imation corp 
has been granted exclusive rights for sales  marketing and distribution of the pearlhdp proofing system 
the company also has agreements with a number of other companies including scitex corporation ltd  nilpeter a s  werner kammann maschinenfabrik gmbh  alcoa packaging equipment  sakurai graphic systems corp  fuji photo film co  ltd 
and akiyama printing machinery manufacturing corporation 
these agreements typically are for the use of the company s direct imaging systems  technology licenses  and or thermal plate materials 
they include a variety of direct to offset printing applications ranging from high quality label production and printing on aluminum cans to the production of normal four color printing 
during the third quarter of fiscal the company determined to sell or otherwise discontinue the operations of its delta v technologies  inc  delta v subsidiary to allow the company to further focus its efforts on the core business of digital imaging and plate manufacturing
