the largest component of the company s net income is its net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets 
net interest income is determined by the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income divided by average interest earning assets represents the company s net interest margin 
average balances  income  expenses and rates 
the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  certain information related to the company s average balance sheet and its average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities 
average balances have been derived from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated

all loans and deposits are domestic

analysis of changes in net interest income 
the following tables set forth the effect which the varying levels of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the applicable rates have had on changes in net interest income from to and to analysis of changes in net interest income year ended december  compared with compared with variance due to variance due to dollars in thousands volume rate total volume rate total earning assets loans     securities  taxable   securities  nontaxable nonmarketable equity securities federal funds sold and other total interest income      interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits interest bearing transaction accounts   savings and market rate investments time deposits   total interest bearing deposits    other short term borrowings federal home loan bank advances long term debt total interest expense     net interest income     volume rate changes have been allocated to each category based on the percentage of the total change 
interest sensitivity 
the company monitors and manages the pricing and maturity of its assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on its net interest income 
the principal monitoring technique employed by the company is the measurement of the company s interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  selling securities available for sale  replacing an asset or liability at maturity  or adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in this same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates 
the following table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity at december  interest sensitivity analysis after one after three greater than within through through one year one three twelve within or non december  dollars in thousands month months months one year sensitive total assets earning assets loans       securities   federal funds sold and other total earning assets       liabilities interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits demand deposits    savings deposits    time deposits       total interest bearing deposits       other short term borrowings    federal home loan bank advances     long term debt   total interest bearing liabilities       period gap      cumulative gap      ratio of cumulative gap to total earning assets excludes nonaccrual loans 
the above table reflects the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at the earlier of their repricing or maturity dates 
overnight federal funds are reflected at the earliest pricing interval due to the immediately available nature of the instruments 
debt securities are reflected at each instrument s ultimate maturity date 
scheduled payment amounts of fixed rate amortizing loans are reflected at each scheduled payment date 
scheduled payment amounts of variable rate amortizing loans are reflected at each scheduled payment date until the loan may be repriced contractually  the unamortized balance is reflected at that point 
interest bearing liabilities with no contractual maturity  such as savings deposits and interest bearing transaction accounts  are reflected in the earliest repricing period due to contractual arrangements which give the company the opportunity to vary the rates paid on those deposits within a thirty day or shorter period 
fixed rate time deposits  principally certificates of deposit  are reflected at their contractual maturity date 
the company generally would benefit from increasing market rates of interest when it has an asset sensitive gap position and generally would benefit from decreasing market rates of interest when it is liability sensitive 
the company is liability sensitive over the one month  three month  and one year time frames 
however  the company s gap analysis is not a precise indicator of its interest sensitivity position 
the analysis presents only a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame  but those rates are viewed by management as significantly less interest sensitive than market based rates such as those paid on non core deposits 
accordingly  management believes a liability sensitive gap position is not as indicative of the company s true interest sensitivity as it would be for an organization which depends to a greater extent on purchased funds to support earning assets 
net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
provision and allowance for loan losses general 
the company has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of its credit portfolio and the timely identification of potential problem credits 
on a quarterly basis  each subsidiary bank s board of directors reviews and approves the appropriate level for that subsidiary bank s allowance for loan losses based upon management s recommendations  the results of the internal monitoring and reporting system  analysis of economic conditions in its markets  and a review of historical statistical data for both the company and other financial institutions 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  which are expensed as the provision for loan losses on the company s income statement  are made periodically to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on management s analysis of the potential risk in the loan portfolio 
loan losses and recoveries are charged or credited directly to the allowance 
the amount of the provision is a function of the level of loans outstanding  the level of nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged against the reserve during a given period  and current and anticipated economic conditions 
the company s allowance for loan losses is based upon judgments and assumptions of risk elements in the portfolio  future economic conditions and other factors affecting borrowers 
the process includes identification and analysis of loss potential in various portfolio segments utilizing a credit risk grading process and specific reviews and evaluations of significant problem credits 
in addition  management monitors the overall portfolio quality through observable trends in delinquency  charge offs  and general and economic conditions in the service area 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the effectiveness of the company s monitoring and analysis system are also reviewed periodically by the banking regulators and the company s independent auditors 
based on present information and an ongoing evaluation  management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to meet presently known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is based upon a number of assumptions about future events which it believes to be reasonable but which may or may not be valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
the company does not allocate the allowance for loan losses to specific categories of loans but evaluates the adequacy on an overall portfolio basis utilizing a risk grading system 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to the company s allowance for loan losses and the composition of charge offs and recoveries for each of the last five years 
allowance for loan losses year ended december  dollars in thousands total loans outstanding at end of period  net of unearned income      average loans outstanding  net of unearned income      balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of period   allowance for loan losses from acquisitions loan losses commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage consumer total loan losses   recoveries of previous loan losses commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage consumer total recoveries net loan losses  provision for loan losses   balance of allowance for loan losses at end of period    allowance for loan losses to period end loans net charge offs to average loans nonperforming assets 
the following table sets forth the company s nonperforming assets for the dates indicated 
nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans   restructured or impaired loans total nonperforming loans   other real estate owned total nonperforming assets   loans days or more past due and still accruing interest nonperforming assets to period end loans and foreclosed property accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  all interest which has been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from current earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual writedown or charge off of the principal balance of the loan which would necessitate additional charges to earnings 
for all periods presented  the additional interest income  which would have been recognized into earnings if the company s nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  is immaterial 
total nonperforming assets decreased to million at december   from million at december  this amount consists primarily of nonaccrual loans at the greenwood bank which totaled million at december  fourteen loans comprised this total at the greenwood bank 
nonperforming assets were 
of total loans and foreclosed property at december  the allowance for loan losses to period end nonperforming assets was at december  potential problem loans 
at december   through their internal review mechanisms  the subsidiary banks had identified million of criticized loans and million of classified loans 
the results of this internal review process are the primary determining factor in management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company s barnwell bank incurred significant loan losses in and that were primarily attributable to a large number of small dollar consumer loans that originated during the fourth quarter of and the beginning of when the loan problem first surfaced  certain loan personnel and administrative changes were made to correct the situation 
however  the magnitude of the problem was not fully realized until the fourth quarter of when an extensive examination was made of the barnwell bank s complete loan portfolio 
as a result of this examination the loan loss provision for the barnwell bank was increased to  for the fourth quarter of and to  for the year which increased its allowance for loan losses to of total loans outstanding at december  in  the barnwell bank added  to the provision for loan losses and charged off  in nonperforming loans 
while management feels that it has taken the necessary actions to correct the problem loan situation at the barnwell bank  the internal review process has identified a number of criticized and classified loans that still existed at december  of the company s million of criticized loans and million of classified loans   and million were identified at the barnwell bank  respectively 
the greenwood bank also incurred significant losses in the greenwood bank charged off  in nonperforming loans 
the greenwood bank added  to its provision for loan loss  bringing the allowance for loan losses to total loans to 
the greenwood bank will continue to deal with nonperforming loans in the coming year as well 
at december   the internal review process had identified million in criticized loans and million in classified loans 
management is committed to addressing potential problem loans at all subsidiary banks 
noninterest income and expense noninterest income 
the largest component of noninterest income is service charges on deposit accounts  which totaled million in  a increase over the level of million 
the increase in service charges was primarily attributable to an increase in the customer base due to the growth of the subsidiary banks in the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the principal components of noninterest income noninterest income year ended december  dollars in thousands service charges on deposit accounts   residential mortgage origination fees securities gains losses commissions from sales of mutual funds income from fiduciary activities other income total noninterest income    noninterest expense

the company s income tax expense was  an increase of  from the amount of  the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in income before taxes of  when compared to however  the amount of nontaxable income from securities offset the majority of income before taxes 
nontaxable securities income was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  earning assets loans 
loans are the largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets 
associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks which management attempts to control and counterbalance 
loans averaged million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
at december   total loans were million compared to million at december  the increase in loans during was primarily due to the continued growth in the new markets created by the subsidiary banks 
the subsidiary banks have also sought opportunities to participate in loans originated by other financial institutions

at december   this category totaled million and represented of the total loan portfolio  compared to million  or  at december  in the context of this discussion  a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan  other than loans for construction purposes  secured by real estate  regardless of the purpose of the loan 
it is common practice for financial institutions in the company s market areas to obtain a security interest in real estate  whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio component 
real estate construction loans increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  residential mortgage loans  which is the largest category of the company s loans  increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  residential real estate loans consist of first and second mortgages on single or multi family residential dwellings 
nonresidential mortgage loans  which include commercial loans and other loans secured by multi family properties and farmland  increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  the overall increase in real estate lending was attributable to the new markets in the local communities of the subsidiary banks and the continued demand for residential and commercial real estate loans in those markets 
the subsidiary banks have been able to compete favorably for residential mortgage loans with other financial institutions by offering fixed rate products having three and five year call provisions 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans increased  or  to million at december   from million at december  this small increase was primarily attributable to the company s focus on mortgage and construction lending opportunities

the diversity of the economy creates opportunities for all types of lending 
the company does not engage in foreign lending 
the repayment of loans in the loan portfolio as they mature is also a source of liquidity for the company 
the following table sets forth the company s loans maturing within specified intervals at december  loan maturity schedule and sensitivity to changes in interest rates over one year one year through over five december  dollars in thousands or less five years years total commercial  financial and agricultural    real estate     consumer and other     loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates  floating interest rates  the information presented in the above table is based on the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
consequently  management believes this treatment presents fairly the maturity and repricing structure of the loan portfolio shown in the above table 
investment securities 
the investment securities portfolio is a significant component of the company s total earning assets 
total securities averaged million in  compared to million in and million in at december   the total securities portfolio was million 
securities designated as available for sale totaled million and were recorded at estimated fair market value  and securities designated as held to maturity totaled  and were recorded at amortized cost 
the securities portfolio also includes nonmarketable equity securities totaling million which are carried at cost because they are not readily marketable or have no quoted market value 
these include investments in federal reserve bank stock  federal home loan bank stock and the stock of four unrelated financial institutions 
the following table sets forth the book value of the securities held by the company at the dates indicated

the yield on state and political subdivisions is presented on a tax equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of 
other attributes of the securities portfolio  including yields and maturities  are discussed above in net interest income interest sensitivity 
short term investments 
short term investments  which consist primarily of federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks  averaged  in  compared to million in and million in at december   short term investments totaled  these funds are a source of the banks liquidity 
federal funds are generally invested in an earning capacity on an overnight basis 
deposits and other interest bearing liabilities average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  to million in  from million in average interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million in  from million in these increases resulted from increases in most categories of interest bearing liabilities 
deposits 
average total deposits increased million  or  to million during  from million during at december   total deposits were million compared to million a year earlier  a decrease of 
the following table sets forth the deposits of the company by category at the dates indicated 
deposits december dollars in thousands percent percent percent percent percent of of of of of amount deposits amount deposits amount deposits amount deposits amount deposits demand deposit accounts      now accounts      money market accounts      savings accounts      time deposits less than       time deposits of  or over      total deposits      core deposits  which exclude certificates of deposit of  or more  provide a relatively stable funding source for the company s loan portfolio and other earning assets 
the company s core deposits increased  to million at december  deposits  and particularly core deposits  have historically been the company s primary source of funding and have enabled the company to meet successfully both its short term and long term liquidity needs 
management anticipates that such deposits will continue to be the company s primary source of funding in the future 
the company s loan to deposit ratio was at december   at the end of  and averaged during the maturity distribution of the company s time deposits over  at december   is set forth in the following table 
maturities of certificates of deposit of  or more after three after six within through through after three six twelve twelve months months months months total certificates of deposit of  or more      approximately of the company s time deposits over  had scheduled maturities within three months and had maturities within six months 
large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rate levels  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
some financial institutions partially fund their balance sheets using large certificates of deposit obtained through brokers 
these brokered deposits are generally expensive and are unreliable as long term funding sources 
accordingly  the company does not solicit brokered deposits 
borrowed funds 
borrowed funds consist of short term borrowings and advances from the federal home loan bank 
short term borrowings are primarily federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
average short term borrowings were million in  an increase of million from federal funds purchased from correspondent banks averaged million in at december  federal funds purchased totaled million 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase averaged million in at december   securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled million 
average federal home loan bank advances during were million compared to million during  an increase of million 
advances from the federal home loan bank are collateralized by debt securities of us government agencies  one to four family residential mortgage loans  and the company s investment in federal home loan bank stock 
at december   borrowings from the federal home loan bank were million compared to million a year earlier 
although management expects to continue using short term borrowing and federal home loan bank advances as secondary funding sources  core deposits will continue to be the company s primary funding source 
of the million advances from the federal home loan bank outstanding at december   million will mature after one year 
long term debt 
long term debt consists of borrowings obtained from two unrelated financial institutions to infuse capital into the belton bank in order to maintain the minimum capital ratios as a result of the belton bank s purchase of two carolina first branches in and for other general construction of branches 
the average balance of the long term debt was million in long term debt totaled million at december  debt with one institution consists of a million line of credit  is collateralized by the stock of the subsidiary banks  and bears interest at a simple interest rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
interest is payable on a quarterly basis 
the line of credit is scheduled to mature on december  debt also consists of  borrowed for the construction of branch offices and bears interest at a variable rate of 
below the prime rate published in the wall street journal 
this debt is unsecured and is due on february  capital the federal reserve board and bank regulatory agencies require bank holding companies and financial institutions to maintain capital at adequate levels based on a percentage of assets and off balance sheet exposures  adjusted for risk weights ranging from to 
under the risk based standard  capital is classified into two tiers 
tier capital of the company consists of common shareholders equity  excluding the unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities  minus intangible assets 
the company s tier capital consists of the allowance for loan losses subject to certain limitations 
a bank holding company s qualifying capital base for purposes of its risk based capital ratio consists of the sum of its tier and tier capital 
the regulatory minimum requirements are for tier and for total risk based capital 
the holding company and subsidiary banks are also required to maintain capital at a minimum level based on average total assets as defined  which is known as the leverage ratio 
only the strongest bank holding companies and banks are allowed to maintain capital at the minimum requirement of 
all others are subject to maintaining ratios to above the minimum 
the company exceeded the federal reserve s fully phased in regulatory capital ratios at december   and  as set forth in the following table 
analysis of capital december  dollars in thousands tier capital    tier capital    total qualifying capital    risk adjusted total assets including off balance sheet exposures    tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio each of the subsidiary banks is required to maintain risk based and leverage ratios similar to those required for the company 
each of the subsidiary banks exceeded these regulatory capital ratios at december   as set forth in the following table 
bank capital ratios tier total risk risk tier december  based based leverage the greenwood bank the clemson bank the barnwell bank the belton bank the newberry bank liquidity management and capital resources liquidity management involves monitoring the company s sources and uses of funds in order to meet its day to day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits 
liquidity represents the ability of a company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
without proper liquidity management  the company would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
liquidity management is made more complex because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
the company s loans to assets ratio and loans to funds ratio increased from to the loans to assets ratio at december  was compared to at december   and the loans to funds ratio at december  was compared to at december  the amount of advances from the federal home loan bank were approximately million at december  compared to million at december  management expects to continue using these advances as a source of funding 
the company obtained borrowings from unrelated financial institutions in to purchase the branches and for other corporate purposes 
at december   total long term debt was million  compared to million at december  additionally  the company has approximately million of unused lines of credit for federal funds purchases 
the company also has approximately million of securities available for sale as a source of liquidity 
the company depends on dividends from the subsidiary banks as its primary source of liquidity 
the ability of the subsidiary banks to pay dividends is subject to general regulatory restrictions which may  but are not expected to  have a material impact on the liquidity available to the company 
generally  banks are not allowed to pay dividends unless the retained earnings are in a positive position 
accordingly  several subsidiary banks may not be able to pay cash in the form of dividends to its parent company in the near future 
the company does not plan to pay cash dividends for the near term 
the company has paid stock dividends in april  august  may  and september and may do so in the future 
accounting rule changes in february  the financial accounting standards board released statement of financial accounting standards sfas  employers disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits 
sfas amends sfas   and and revises employer s disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefit plans 
it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans 
at december   the company was not affected by this statement 
in june  the financial accounting standards board released statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure these instruments at fair values 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
the company generally does not purchase derivative instruments or enter into hedging activities 
this statement was effective for fiscal years beginning after june   but was amended by sfas the company was not affected by financial accounting standards board statements  or in  the financial accounting standards board released statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
as stated  this statement delays the effective date for the implementation of sfas this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as the company and its subsidiaries are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on the company s performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed previously  management seeks to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
industry developments on november   the us senate and house of representatives each passed the gramm leach bliley act  previously known as the financial services modernization act of the act was signed into law by president clinton in november among other things  the act repeals the restrictions on banks affiliating with securities firms contained in sections and of the glass steagall act 
the act also creates a new financial holding company under the bank holding company act  which will permit holding companies to engage in a statutorily provided list of financial activities  including insurance and securities underwriting and agency activities  merchant banking  and insurance company portfolio investment activities 
the act also authorizes activities that are complementary to financial activities 
the act is intended to grant to community banks certain powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis 
nevertheless  the act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that the company faces from larger institutions and other types of companies 
in fact  it is not possible to predict the full effect that the act will have on the company 
from time to time  various bills are introduced in the united states congress with respect to the regulation of financial institutions 
certain of these proposals  if adopted  could significantly change the regulation of banks and the financial services industry 
the company cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  how these proposals would affect the company
