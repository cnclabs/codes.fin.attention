the company sells its systems to government and private clinical laboratories  research institutions  universities and pharmaceutical companies  and has sold such systems to approximately sites in over countries 
the company previously pursued a prenatal genetic screening development program focused on the isolation of specific fetal cells from a blood sample taken from the expectant mother 
while substantial research progress was made towards the development of a reliable method for non invasive prenatal diagnosis  the company has concluded that its methods do not currently constitute a commercially viable system for this purpose 
accordingly  the company has shifted its research efforts and resources to its cancer imaging programs  with a focus on the detection of rare micrometastatic cancer cells in a variety of sample types
