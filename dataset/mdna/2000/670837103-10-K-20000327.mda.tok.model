item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis overview oge energy corp 
the company reported earnings of a share in  a percent decrease from a share in the decrease was primarily the result of lower revenues at oklahoma gas and electric company og e due to milder weather in the og e service area  lower recoveries under the generation efficiency performance rider gep rider and less revenue from sales to other utilities and power marketers off system sales 
the gep rider  which was implemented in  allows og e to retain part of the fuel savings achieved through cost efficiencies and is discussed in more detail below 
the decrease in earnings was partially offset by significantly higher earnings at the company s enogex inc natural gas pipeline business  and benefits resulting from the company repurchasing million shares of its common stock on january  the increase in earnings to a share from a share in was primarily the result of higher revenues at og e due to warmer weather  the gep rider  higher margin off system sales  customer growth and lower operation and maintenance expense 
the increase in earnings in was partially offset by lower earnings at enogex inc and its subsidiaries enogex 
percent change from prior year thousands except per share amounts operating revenues    earnings available for common stock    average shares outstanding    earnings per average common share earnings per average common share assuming dilution dividends paid per share the company serves as the parent holding company to og e  enogex and oge energy capital trust i  a financing trust established in this holding company structure is intended to provide greater flexibility  allowing the company to take advantage of opportunities in an increasingly competitive business environment and to clearly separate the company s electric utility business from its non utility businesses 
because og e is the company s principal subsidiary  the company s financial results and condition are substantially dependent at this time on the financial results and condition of og e 
the following discussion and analysis presents factors which had a material effect on the operations and financial position of the company and its subsidiaries during the last three years and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
average shares outstanding and all per share amounts have been restated to reflect the two for one stock split that occurred in june trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent known and considered relevant 
the dividend payout ratio expressed as a percentage of earnings available for common shareholders was percent in as compared to percent in  within the company s desired dividend payout ratio of percent or below based on the current business environment 
future dividend action will be dependent primarily on two factors 
first  the appropriate payout ratio will be determined by the pace and structure of the deregulation of the electric utility business 
second  the payout rates will continue to be based on current and anticipated operating results 
on a positive note  the staff of the oklahoma corporation commission reported in og e s recent performance based rate filing that og e s electric rates as a whole were appropriate and did not warrant a general rate review  which in the company s judgment  virtually eliminates the likelihood of an adverse general rate case in oklahoma prior to the start of deregulation 
the company s regulated utility business has been and will continue to be affected by competitive changes to the utility industry 
significant changes already have occurred in the wholesale electric markets at the federal level and significant changes are expected at the retail level in the states served by og e 
in oklahoma  legislation was passed in to provide for the orderly restructuring of the electric industry with the goal to provide retail customers with the ability to choose their generation suppliers by june  in april  arkansas became the th state to pass a law calling for restructuring of the electric utility industry at the retail level 
the new law targets customer choice of electricity providers by january  these developments at the federal and state levels are described in more detail below under regulation  competition 
on july   the company  through enogex  completed its largest acquisition in its history by acquiring tejas transok holding  llc and its subsidiaries transok  a gatherer  processor and transporter of natural gas in oklahoma and texas 
transok s principal assets include approximately  miles of natural gas pipelines in oklahoma and texas with a capacity of approximately billion cubic feet per day and billion cubic feet of underground natural gas storage 
transok also owns gas processing plants  which produced approximately  barrels per day of natural gas liquids in enogex purchased transok for million  which includes assumption of million of long term debt 
integration of transok s operations continues on schedule and operation of the combined natural gas pipelines turned accretive to oge energy s earnings in the fourth quarter  earlier than previously expected 
transok posted net income of million in the fourth quarter of while million in synergies were expected with the acquisition  about million in synergies already have been realized or identified and further improvement is possible in the coming year 
forward looking statements except for the historical statements contained herein  the matters discussed in the following discussion and analysis  are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such forward looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words anticipate  estimate  objective  possible  potential and similar expressions 
actual results may vary materially 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  including their impact on capital expenditures  business conditions in the energy industry  competitive factors  unusual weather  regulatory decisions  and the other risk factors listed in the reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations revenues percent change from prior year thousands sales of electricity to og e customers    off system sales    enogex    miscellaneous total operating revenues    system megawatt hour sales    off system megawatt hour sales    total megawatt hour sales    in  approximately percent of the company s revenues consisted of regulated sales of electricity as a public utility  while the remaining percent were provided by the non utility operations of enogex 
revenues from sales of electricity are somewhat seasonal  with a large portion of the company s annual electric revenues occurring during the summer months when the electricity needs of its customers increase 
enogex s primary operations consist of gathering and processing natural gas  transporting natural gas through its pipelines in oklahoma  arkansas and texas for various customers including og e  marketing electricity  natural gas and natural gas liquids and investing in the drilling for and production of natural gas and crude oil 
actions of the regulatory commissions that set og e s electric rates will continue to affect the company s financial results 
the commissions also have the authority to examine the appropriateness of og e s recovery from its customers of fuel costs  which include the transportation fees that og e pays enogex for transporting natural gas to og e s generating units 
see regulation  competition and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of the oklahoma corporation commission occ rate order dated february   on these transportation fees 
operating revenues increased million or percent during  due to a significant increase in revenue from enogex 
in  enogex consolidated revenues increased million or percent  primarily due to a significant increase in sales volumes and rising prices in natural gas and natural gas liquids  the acquisition of transok in july million and increased power marketing sales million 
the increased revenues from enogex were partially offset by decreased revenues at og e 
revenues at og e decreased million or percent primarily due to a decrease in kilowatt hour sales to og e customers system sales and off system sales  both of which were higher in because of the record heat of lower recoveries under the gep rider also contributed to lower revenues at og e 
on february   the occ issued an order the order that  among other things  effectively lowered og e s rates to its oklahoma retail customers by million annually based on a test year ended december  
of the million rate reduction  approximately million became effective on march   and the remaining million became effective march  this million rate reduction was in addition to the million rate reduction that was effective january  the order also directed og e to transition to competitive bidding of its gas transportation requirements  currently met by enogex  no later than april   and set annual compensation for the transportation services provided by enogex to og e at million until competitively bid gas transportation begins 
the million included million associated with the amortization of the acquisition premium paid by og e when it acquired enogex in such premium was fully recovered at march   and as a result  the million annual rate will be lowered to million annually 
the order also established the gep rider  which is designed so that when og e s average annual cost of fuel per kwh is less than percent of the average non nuclear fuel cost per kwh of certain other investor owned utilities in the region  og e is allowed to collect  through the gep rider  one third of the amount by which og e s average annual cost of fuel is less than percent of the average of the other specified utilities 
if og e s fuel cost exceeds percent of the stated average  og e will not be allowed to recover one third of the fuel costs above that amount from oklahoma customers 
as explained below  the gep rider is currently under review by the occ 
the fuel cost information used to calculate the gep rider is based on fuel cost data submitted by each of the utilities in their form no 
annual report filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the gep rider is revised effective july of each year to reflect any changes in the relative annual cost of fuel reported for the preceding calendar year 
for  the gep rider contributed approximately million to revenues  which was approximately million  or approximately per share lower than the current gep rider is estimated to positively impact revenue by million or approximately per share during the months ending june during  revenues increased million or percent 
revenues at og e increased million or percent and at enogex increased million or percent 
in  og e revenues increased primarily due to higher system sales from warmer weather  the gep rider  higher off system sales and customer growth 
kilowatt hour sales by og e to other utilities decreased percent in  however  the summer heat drove prices of this off system electricity to record levels  increasing operating revenues approximately million in and at margins significantly higher than had been experienced in the past 
there can be no assurance that such margins on future off system sales will occur again 
enogex revenues increased in primarily as a result of significant increases in the volumes of natural gas sold through its gas marketing activities million  gas transportation services million and marketing of electricity million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in natural gas liquids processed and sold million 
the increased gas related revenues were attributable primarily to significantly higher volumes sold which more than offset a decrease in sales prices as such commodity prices were depressed 
other factors contributing to the revenue increases were the acquisitions in of the noark pipeline and ozark pipeline  which are described below 
the increased electricity related revenues were due to the expansion in into the marketing of electricity 
expenses and other items percent change from prior year dollars in thousands fuel    purchased power    gas and electricity purchased for resale enogex    other operation and maintenance    depreciation and amortization    taxes other than income    total operating expenses    total other income expenses    provision for income taxes    total operating expenses increased million or percent in  primarily due to a significant increase in sales volumes  rising prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids  the mid year acquisition of transok by enogex  and due to the record numbers and severity of tornadoes that damaged og e facilities 
enogex s gas and electricity purchased for resale pursuant to its energy marketing operations increased million or percent for as compared to million or percent for the increase was due to a significant increase in sales volumes of natural gas  the acquisition of transok million  and increased power marketing sales 
the increase was due to a significant increase in sales volumes of natural gas which more than offset a decrease in sales prices due to depressed commodity prices  and the expansion into the marketing of electricity 
other operation and maintenance increased million or percent in primarily because of expansion activities at enogex million and higher bad debt expense at og e million 
these increases were partially offset by reduced general corporate expenses million 
in  other operation and maintenance decreased million or percent primarily because of decreases at og e in post retirement medical costs million  lower bad debt expense million  completion in february of the amortization of the million regulatory asset established in connection with og e s workforce reduction million and lower general corporate expenses million 
these decreases were partially offset by expansion activities at enogex million 
in  depreciation and amortization increased million or percent  reflecting increased depreciable plant  primarily property of transok million 
the increase in reflects higher levels of depreciable plant 
in  taxes decreased million or percent primarily due to the reduction of pre tax income from to in  taxes increased million or percent due to significantly higher pre tax income 
og e s purchased power costs increased million or percent in due in large part to emergency purchases in the aftermath of tornadoes  on may  and june   which inflicted heavy damage to the og e power supply  transmission and delivery systems 
in  the cost of purchased energy per kwh increased percent 
during  purchased power costs increased million or percent primarily due to a percent increase in the quantities purchased 
during  og e also began purchasing power from mid continent power company mcpc 
payments to mcpc in were approximately million 
mcpc is a qualified cogeneration facility from which og e is required to purchase peaking capacity through as required by the public utility regulatory policy act purpa  og e is currently purchasing power from qualified cogeneration facilities 
interest expense increased million or percent in primarily due to higher interest charges at enogex and costs associated with increased short term debt incurred to finance the transok acquisition 
the increase in interest expense for was attributable to an increase in the average daily balance of short term debt 
interest on long term debt decreased as a result of og e refinancing million of long term debt at favorable rates 
the resulting savings was partially offset by enogex issuing million of long term debt 
og e s generating capability is fairly evenly divided between coal and natural gas and provides for flexibility to use either fuel to the best economic advantage for og e and its customers 
in  fuel costs decreased million or percent primarily due to a percent decrease in total energy generated which offset a percent increase in the average cost of fuel burned for generation of electricity 
during  fuel costs increased due to a modest increase in total generation and a slight increase in the average cost of fuel burned 
variances in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs  as compared to that component in cost of service for ratemaking  are passed through to og e s electric customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
the automatic fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the occ  the arkansas public service commission apsc and the ferc 
the occ  the apsc and the ferc have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees og e pays enogex  which og e seeks to recover through the fuel adjustment clause or other tariffs 
also  as explained below  the occ staff recently filed an application to review issues under og e s fuel adjustment clause in oklahoma 
liquidity and capital resources the primary capital requirements for and as estimated for through are as follows dollars in millions electric utility construction expenditures including afudc non utility construction expenditures and acquisitions maturities of long term debt total the company s primary needs for capital are related to construction of new facilities to meet anticipated demand for og e s utility service  to replace or expand existing facilities in og e s electric utility business  to replace or expand existing facilities in its non utility businesses  to acquire new non utility facilities or businesses and  to some extent  to satisfy maturing debt 
the company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of internally generated funds  short term borrowings and permanent financing 
capital requirements and financing activities capital requirements were million in a substantial portion of this was related to the acquisition of transok 
approximately million of the capital requirements were to comply with environmental regulations 
this compares to capital requirements of million in  of which million was to comply with environmental regulations 
during  the company s sources of capital were internally generated funds from operating cash flows  permanent financing and short term borrowings 
variations in accounts receivable and accounts payable are not generally significant indicators of the company s liquidity  as such variations are primarily attributable to fluctuations in weather in og e s service territory  which has a direct effect on sales of electricity 
short term borrowings were used during to meet temporary cash requirements 
at december   the company had outstanding short term borrowings of million  of which approximately million pertained to debt incurred to finance the acquisition of transok 
through the recent financing described below by enogex in january  the short term debt of the company at january  was million 
on july   enogex completed its acquisition of transok for approximately million  which included assumption of million of long term debt 
the purchase of transok was temporarily funded through a million revolving bank credit agreement 
on october   the company  through a new financing subsidiary trust  issued million of percent trust preferred securities which mature october   and all of the proceeds were used to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving bank credit agreement implemented in connection with the acquisition of transok 
to repay the balance of the temporary short term debt associated with the transok acquisition million  on january   enogex sold million of percent senior unsecured notes due january  enogex entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements to manage interest costs associated with this million issue 
the effect of these swap agreements reduces the overall effective interest rate from percent to percent during the first year 
the balance of the proceeds from the sale was used for general corporate purposes 
on september   enogex retired million principal amount of percent medium term notes due september  enogex assumed this debt as a current liability in the acquisition of transok in july on january   the company repurchased million shares of its common stock under an advanced share repurchase agreement with cibc oppenheimer corp 
the purchase price was million or per share  the closing price on january  under the terms of this advanced share repurchase agreement  the company agreed to bear the risk of increases and the benefit of decreases on the price of the common stock until cibc oppenheimer corp 
replaced  through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions  the shares sold to the company 
the company previously announced  in november  plans to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock over the succeeding two years 
however  the company has chosen not to repurchase any additional shares of its common stock at this time and this advanced share repurchase agreement was terminated on january  future capital requirements the company s construction program for the next several years does not include additional base load generating units 
rather  to meet the increased electricity needs of og e s electric utility customers during the foreseeable future  og e will concentrate on maintaining the reliability  increasing the utilization of existing capacity and increasing demand side management efforts 
approximately million of the company s construction expenditures budgeted for are to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
on october   enogex entered into an option agreement to purchase two gas turbine generators for use in normal operations for approximately million 
this agreement was transferred to the company in september these two generators produce approximately megawatts of additional peak load each 
the total cost of this project is expected to be approximately million 
in august  og e announced the reactivation of two of its generators that have been idle for several years 
these two generators together produce approximately megawatts of additional peak load 
the total cost of this reactivation project is expected to be approximately million 
by june   the company plans to begin using these four generators  increasing its electric generating capacity by approximately percent 
future financing requirements may be dependent  to varying degrees  upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions  abnormal weather  load growth  acquisitions of other businesses  inflation  changes in environmental laws or regulations  rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies  new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators 
future sources of financing management expects that internally generated funds will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated construction expenditures  while maturities of long term debt will require permanent financing  with the amount and type dependent on market conditions at the time 
short term borrowings will continue to be used to meet temporary cash requirements 
the company has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to million in short term borrowings at any one time 
at december   the company had in place a line of credit for up to million  million was to expire on january   and the remaining million was to expire on january  in january  the company s line of credit was increased to million  million to expire on january   and million to expire on january  the company continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance shareowner returns and achieve long term financial objectives through acquisitions of non utility businesses 
permanent financing could be required for such acquisitions 
the year issue a non event there was a great deal of publicity about the year yk and the possible problems that information technology systems may have suffered as a result 
as the year approached  it was feared that date sensitive systems might recognize the year as  or not at all  potentially causing systems  including those of the company  its customers  suppliers  business partners and neighboring utilities to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly  if they were not year ready 
a failure to identify and correct any such processing problems prior to january  could have resulted in material operational and financial risks if the affected systems either ceased to function or produced erroneous data 
however  the company was aggressive and did its work well in addressing the risks associated with the yk issue 
the company s goal was to minimize the impact of yk and our goal was accomplished 
yk was a non event 
costs of year issues with the company s mainframe conversion in  the sap enterprise software installations for the financial and customer systems in and  respectively  and the energy management system replacement in  a number of yk issues were addressed as part of the company s normal course upgrades to the information technology systems 
these upgrades were already contemplated and provided additional benefits or efficiencies beyond the year aspect 
since  the company has spent approximately million on the mainframe conversion  the initial financial enterprise software systems  the customer care enterprise software installations and the scada ems replacement 
risks of year issues the company experienced only one minor problem which occurred on new year s day when a computer system in og e s outage management system showed an error that was corrected within an hour with a vendor provided patch 
although the company has not experienced any major yk problems to date  the company believes some risks still exist as it may take a full year to identify and address all the potential problems in the company s business systems resulting from yk upgrades  corrections and patches 
contingencies the company through its subsidiaries is defending various claims and legal actions  including environmental actions  which are common to its operations 
for a further discussion of these actions  including a lawsuit involving trigen oklahoma city energy corporation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as to environmental matters  og e has been designated as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to two waste disposal sites to which og e sent materials 
remediation and required monitoring of one of these sites has been completed 
while it is not possible to determine the precise outcome of these matters  in the opinion of management  og e s ultimate liability for these sites will not be material 
beginning in  og e will be limited in the amount of sulfur dioxide it will be allowed to emit into the atmosphere 
in order to comply with this limit  the company has contracted for lower sulfur coal 
og e believes this will allow it to meet this limit without additional capital expenditures 
with respect to nitrogen oxides  og e continues to meet the current emission standard 
however  regulations on regional haze  the possibility of having a new ozone ambient standard that oklahoma will not be able to meet  and oklahoma s potential for not being able to meet the new particulate standard  could require further reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides 
if this occurs  significant capital expenditures and increased operating and maintenance costs would result 
in  the united states was a signatory to the kyoto protocol on global warming 
if ratified by the us senate  this protocol could have a tremendous impact on the company s operations  by requiring the company to significantly reduce the use of coal as a fuel source  since the protocol would require a seven percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below the level 
the oklahoma department of environmental quality s caaa title v permitting program was approved by the epa in march by march of  og e had submitted all required permit applications and by december   og e expects to have new title v permits for all of its major source generating stations 
air permit fees for generating stations were approximately million in and are estimated to be about the same in by december   the epa is expected to decide whether or not to regulate mercury emissions from coal fired utility boilers 
if the decision is made to regulate  limits on the amount of mercury emitted are expected to be proposed by december with the company s compliance required by this could result in significant capital and operating expenditures 
competition  regulation as previously reported  oklahoma enacted in april the electric restructuring act of the act 
various amendments to the act were enacted in if implemented as proposed  the act will significantly affect og e s future operations 
the purpose of the act  as set forth therein  is generally to restructure the electric utility industry to provide for more competition and  in particular  to provide for the orderly restructuring of the electric utility industry in oklahoma in order to allow customers to choose their electricity suppliers while maintaining the safety and reliability of the electric system in the state 
the act directed the joint electric utility task force  composed of seven members from the oklahoma senate and seven members from the oklahoma house of representatives  to undertake a study of all relevant issues relating to restructuring the electric utility industry in oklahoma and to develop a proposed electric utility framework for oklahoma 
the study was to be delivered in several parts 
as a result of the amendments  the time frame for the delivery of the remaining parts of the study was accelerated to october  this study addressed i technical issues including reliability  safety  unbundling of generation  transmission and distribution services  transition issues and market power  ii financial issues including rates  charges  access fees  transition costs and stranded costs  iii consumer issues such as the obligation to serve  service territories  consumer choices  competition and consumer safeguards  and iv tax issues including sales and use taxes  ad valorem taxes and franchise fees 
neither the oklahoma tax commission nor the occ is authorized to issue any rules on such matters without the approval of the oklahoma legislature 
other provisions of the act i authorize the joint electric utility task force to retain consultants to study  among other things  the creation of an independent system operator  ii prohibit customer switching prior to july   except by mutual consent  iii prohibit municipalities that do not become subject to the act  from selling power outside their municipal limits  except from lines owned on april   iv require a uniform tax policy be established by july  and v require out of state suppliers of electricity and their affiliates who make retail sales of electricity in oklahoma through the use of transmission and distribution facilities of in state suppliers to provide equal access to their transmission and distribution facilities outside of oklahoma 
the act was modified during the session of the oklahoma legislature to clarify certain ambiguities by defining key terms in the act 
with the completion of the studies described above in october  the oklahoma legislature is expected to implement additional legislation  which will address many specific issues associated with deregulation 
several bills have already been introduced 
while the company cannot predict the terms of the new legislation  the company intends to participate actively in the legislative process 
in april  arkansas became the th state to pass a law calling for restructuring of the electric utility industry 
the new law targets customer choice of electricity providers by january  the new law also provides that utilities owning or controlling transmission assets must transfer control of such transmission assets to an independent system operator  independent transmission company or regional transmission group  if any such organization has been approved by the ferc 
other provisions of the new law permit municipal electric systems to opt in or out  permit recovery of stranded costs and transition costs and require unbundled rates by july  for generation  transmission  distribution and customer service 
as required by the new law  the apsc is in the process of adopting regulations that will implement the new law 
the new law and related regulations will significantly affect og e s future arkansas operations 
og e s electric service area includes parts of western arkansas  including fort smith  the second largest metropolitan market in the state 
the occ also has adopted rules that are designed to make the gas utility business in oklahoma more competitive 
these rules do not impact the electric industry 
yet  if implemented  the rules are expected to offer increased opportunities to enogex s pipeline and related businesses 
these efforts to increase competition in the electric industry at the state level in oklahoma and arkansas have been paralleled and even surpassed by efforts at the federal level to increase competition in the wholesale markets for electricity 
in october  the national energy policy act of energy act was enacted 
among many other provisions  the energy act is designed to promote competition in the development of wholesale power generation in the electric utility industry 
it exempts a new class of independent power producers ipps from regulation under the public utility holding company act of and allows the ferc to order wholesale wheeling by public utilities to provide utility and non utility generators access to public utility transmission facilities 
within four years of the enactment of the energy act  ferc issued order and order to facilitate third party utilization of the transmission grid as the vehicle for developing a more competitive wholesale bulk power market 
order requires all transmission owners to offer comparable open access transmission service for wholesale transactions under a tariff of general applicability on file at ferc and take transmission service for their own wholesale sales under their open access tariff 
order requires electric utilities to functionally separate their transmission and reliability functions from their wholesale power marketing functions 
in this connection  order required electric utilities to develop and maintain an open access same time information system oasis to ensure that transmission customers have access to transmission information  through electronic means  that will enable them to obtain open access transmission service on a basis comparable to a transmitting utility s own use of its system 
the energy act  orders and  and other ferc policies and initiatives have had a tremendous impact on the development of a competitive wholesale power market 
utilities  including og e  have increased their own in house wholesale marketing efforts and the number of entities with whom they trade 
moreover  power marketers are an increasingly important presence in the industry 
these entities typically arbitrage wholesale price differentials by buying power produced by others in one market and selling it in another 
ipps also are becoming a more significant sector of the electric utility industry 
in both oklahoma and arkansas  significant additions of new power plants have been announced  almost all of it from ipps 
notwithstanding these developments in the wholesale power market  ferc recognized that impediments remained to the achievement of fully competitive wholesale markets including engineering and economic inefficiencies inherent in the current operation and expansion of the transmission grid and continuing opportunities for transmission owners to discriminate in the operation of their transmission facilities in favor of their own or affiliated power marketing activities 
whereas ferc in the past only encouraged utilities to join and place their transmission systems under the operational control of independent system operators isos  ferc  issued order on december   its final rule on regional transmission organizations rtos 
order sets out a timetable for every jurisdictional utility including og e to either join in an rto filing  or  alternatively  to submit a filing by october  describing its efforts to join in an rto  the reasons for not participating in an rto proposal and any obstacles to participation  and its plans for further work toward participation 
public utilities that have already transferred control of their facilities to a ferc approved rto must file with ferc by january   a statement explaining  among other things  how such rto has the minimum characteristics and performs the minimum functions identified by ferc in the final rule 
these minimum characteristics and functions are intended to have the effect of turning the nation s transmission facilities into independently operated common carriers that offer comparable service to all would be users 
although adopting a voluntary approach towards rto formation  ferc stressed that order does not preclude it from requiring rto participation 
og e is a member of the southwest power pool spp  the regional reliability organization for oklahoma  arkansas  kansas  louisiana  missouri and part of texas 
og e participated with the spp in the development of regional transmission tariffs and executed an agency agreement with the spp to facilitate interstate transmission operations within this region 
og e presently intends to meet its obligations to transfer operational control of its transmission system to an rto under order and under the new arkansas deregulation law through the spp 
the spp has asked for ferc recognition as an iso consistent with ferc s iso guidelines in its order and related provisions in order the transfer of operational control of og e s transmission system to a ferc approved rto is not expected to impact significantly og e s financial results 
yet  it is expected to increase the markets in which og e can sell power at wholesale and  at the same time  to increase competition in such wholesale markets 
as a low cost producer of electricity with two of the most efficient power plants in the country  og e expects to remain a competitive supplier of electricity 
as discussed previously  legislation was enacted in oklahoma and arkansas that will restructure the electric utility industry in those states  assuming that all the conditions in the legislation are met 
this legislation would deregulate og e s electric generation assets and the continued use of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation with respect to the related regulatory assets may no longer be appropriate 
this may result in either full recovery of generation related regulatory assets net of related regulatory liabilities or a non cash  pre tax write off as an extraordinary charge of up to million  depending on the transition mechanisms developed by the legislature for the recovery of all or a portion of these net regulatory assets 
the enacted oklahoma and arkansas legislation does not affect og e s electric transmission and distribution assets and the company believes that the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the related regulatory assets is appropriate 
however  if utility regulators in oklahoma and arkansas were to adopt regulatory methodologies in the future that are not based on cost of service  the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the regulatory assets related to the electric transmission and distribution assets may no longer be appropriate 
based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery  management believes that its regulatory assets  including those related to generation  are probable of future recovery 
as stated previously  the occ in its order  directed og e to commence competitively bid gas transportation service to its gas fired plants no later than april  the order also set annual compensation for the transportation services provided by enogex to og e at million annually until march   at which time the rate would drop to million reflecting the completion of the recovery from ratepayers of the amortization premium paid by og e when it acquired enogex in and remain at that level until competitively bid gas transportation begins 
final firms bids were submitted by enogex and other pipelines on april  in july  og e filed an application with the occ requesting approval of a performance based rate plan for its oklahoma retail customers from april until the introduction of customer choice for electric power in july as part of this application  og e stated that enogex had submitted the only viable bid million per year for gas transportation to its six gas fired power plants that were the subject of the competitive bid 
as part of its application to the occ  og e offered to discount enogex s bid from million annually to million annually 
og e has executed a new gas transportation contract with enogex under which enogex would continue serving the needs of og e s power plants at a price to be paid by og e of million annually and  if og e s proposal had been approved by the occ  og e would have recovered a portion of such amount million from its ratepayers 
the occ staff  the office of the oklahoma attorney general and a coalition of industrial customers filed testimony questioning various parts of og e s performance based rate plan  including the result of the competitive bid process  and suggested  among other things  that the bidding process be repeated or that gas transportation service to five of og e s gas fired plants be awarded to parties other than enogex 
the occ staff also filed testimony stating in substance that og e s electric rates as a whole were appropriate and did not warrant a rate review 
og e negotiated with these parties in an effort to settle all issues including the competitive bid process associated with its application for a performance based rate plan 
when these negotiations failed  og e withdrew its application  which withdrawal was approved by the occ in december based on filed testimony  og e believes that enogex properly won the competitive bid and  unless og e s decision to award its gas transportation service to enogex is abrogated by order of the occ which order is upheld on appeal  that it intends to fulfill its obligations under its new gas transportation contract with enogex at a price of million annually 
whether og e will be able to recover the entire amount from its ratepayers has not been determined as explained below 
on january   the staff filed three applications to address various aspects of og e s electric rates 
two of the applications were expected  while the third pertains to recoveries under og e s fuel adjustment clause 
the first application relates to the completion of the recovery of the amortization premium paid by og e when it acquired enogex in and the resulting removal of this million from the amounts currently being paid annually by og e to enogex and being recovered by og e from its ratepayers

og e assumes that this application also will be used to address the competitive bid process of its gas transportation service 
the company cannot predict the precise outcome of these proceedings at this time  but does not expect that they will have a material effect on its operations 
on february   the apsc staff filed a motion for a show cause order to review og e s electric rates in the state of arkansas 
the staff recommended a million annual rate reduction based on a test year ended december  
the staff and og e reached a settlement for a million annual rate reduction  which was approved by the apsc in august market risk risk management the risk management process established by the company is designed to measure both quantitative and qualitative risks in its businesses 
a senior risk management committee has been established to review these risks on a regular basis 
the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and certain commodity prices 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  the company enters into various derivative transactions pursuant to the company s policies on hedging practices 
derivative positions are monitored using techniques such as mark to market valuation  value at risk and sensitivity analysis 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to long term debt obligations and commercial paper 
the company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate debt to a certain percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the company may utilize interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest rate expense related to existing debt issues 
interest rate derivatives are used solely to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the overall leverage of the debt portfolio 
the fair value of long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices and management s estimate of current rates available for similar issues 
the following table itemizes the company s long term debt maturities and the weighted average interest rates by maturity date 
year end dollars in millions thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt principal amount   weighted average interest rate variable rate debt principal amount weighted average interest rate commodity price exposure the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss in value arising from adverse changes in the company s commodity prices 
the prices of natural gas and electricity are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in supply and demand 
to partially reduce price risk caused by these market fluctuations  the company may hedge through the utilization of derivatives a portion of the company s supply and related purchase and sale contracts  as well as any anticipated transactions purchases and sales 
because the commodities covered by these derivatives are substantially the same commodities that the company buys and sells in the physical market  no special studies other than monitoring the degree of correlation between the derivative and cash markets  are deemed necessary 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the price exposure to the market risk of the company s natural gas and electricity commodity positions 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of natural gas inventories  purchased electric capacity  commodity purchase and sales contracts  and derivative financial and commodity instruments 
the fair value of such position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in such prices over the next months 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows for fiscal dollars in thousands wholesale non trading commodity market risk  net in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities  with an effective date for periods beginning after june  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 

as a result of sfas no 
 adoption of sfas no 
is now required for financial statements for periods beginning after june  sfas no 
sweeps in a broad population of transactions and changes the previous accounting definition of a derivative instrument 
under sfas no 
 every derivative instrument is recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the company will prospectively adopt this new standard effective january   and management believes the adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operation 
besides the various existing contingencies herein described  and those described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s ability to fund its future operational needs and to finance its construction program is dependent upon numerous other factors beyond its control  such as general economic conditions  abnormal weather  load growth  inflation  new environmental laws or regulations  and the cost and availability of external financing
