liquidity and capital resources financial flexibility during the latter half of and continuing into  the real estate industry experienced a reduced supply of favorably priced equity and debt capital  which generally decreased the level of new investment activity by real estate companies 
while the company has been subject to the same capital market conditions as other real estate companies  management believes the company s financial and liquidity position are relatively strong 
over the years  the company has carefully managed its balance sheet in an effort to avoid liquidity issues in any given quarter or year 
in management s view  this should provide a competitive advantage in the current capital constrained market over many of its competitors 
following are three key indicators that demonstrate the overall strength of the company s financial position 
first  the company believes that its strong balance sheet and expected real estate asset disposition proceeds will provide the company with sufficient capital to fund its investment activities during without the need to raise additional common equity 
second  the company has only million of final debt maturities in third  as of december   the company has a total of million of undrawn capacity on its existing lines of credit to meet its short term obligations 
although it is not clear how long the current market conditions will prevail  management believes that these key factors will provide the company with substantial financial flexibility to capitalize on investment opportunities which may not be available to other real estate companies with more limited financial resources 
operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by million in as compared to and by million in as compared to these increases are due primarily to the weeks merger in july  the development and acquisition of additional rental properties  and cash flow from existing real estate assets

both lines of credit are used to fund development and acquisition of additional rental properties and to provide working capital 
effective july   the interest rate on the million line of credit was adjusted from libor

funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo  which is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net income or loss  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of depreciated property  plus operating property depreciation and amortization and adjustments for minority interest and unconsolidated companies on the same basis  is the industry standard for reporting the operations of real estate investment trusts

while management believes that ffo is the most relevant and widely used measure of the company s operating performance  such amount does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance  and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
year the company did not experience any year related disruptions or failures to its internal operations or the critical building systems of its properties 
the primary focus of the company s year project was to protect the tenant spaces  buildings and internal operating systems 
the rewards of the company s year planning efforts can be found in the detailed emergency contingency plans that are now in place for all buildings in all markets 
with these plans in place  in the event of major unforeseen events such as loss of electricity  utilities or other vital services  the company s property asset managers are better equipped to efficiently and effectively respond to such emergencies 
in addition to the foregoing  enhancements were made to the company s internal information systems software and hardware in preparation for the year it is expected that these upgrades and replacements will benefit the company s business operations for years to come 
non reimbursable costs to the company in preparing for the year were approximately item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts in thousands of the expected annual maturities  weighted average interest rates for the average debt outstanding in the specified period  fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
the fair values of the company s debt instruments are calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved

moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates
