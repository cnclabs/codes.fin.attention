item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion provides information about the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity  and asset quality of the company 
this information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the financial condition of the company and the results of its operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented herein 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
results of operations general for the year ended december   the company earned million  or per diluted share  reflecting a return on average assets roa of and a return on average equity roe of 
the company earned million  or per diluted share  with a roa of and a roe of for the year ended december   and million  or per diluted share before extraordinary item  for the year ended december  the company s consolidated capital structure has changed significantly since  initially as a result of its recapitalization in december  and then again in december  due to its refinancing of the securities issued in the recapitalization  through the sale of senior notes senior notes 
the results for included an extraordinary item of million incurred in connection with the early repayment  and the accelerated write off of unamortized issue costs and discounts  of the senior notes due  and series a preferred stock 
in july  the company completed a public offering of approximately million shares of its common stock  which raised approximately million of net proceeds 
in addition  the company returned to taxable status during  following several years in which it realized substantial income tax benefits from utilization of accumulated operating loss carry forwards 
the table below identifies the principal components of the company s pretax income and the company s net income for the three years ended december   and  respectively

the increase in net interest income reflects the growth in the company s loans and deposits during the growth in net interest income resulted from a increase in average earning assets from and a decrease in the average cost of funds to during from and during and  respectively 
the company s resulting net interest margin from was compared to during and  respectively 
the bank recorded a provision for estimated credit losses of million during  compared to million and million during and  respectively 
this growth in the provision for credit losses was the result of management s previously announced commitment to increase the bank s allowance for estimated credit losses by the end of this commitment acknowledges the significant growth in net loans  the introduction during and of new loan products  and the resulting lack of seasoning of many of the bank s loans 
at december   the ratio of the total allowance for estimated credit losses to total loans  net of specific reserves  reached compared to and at december  and  respectively 
noninterest revenues were million for the twelve months ended december   compared to noninterest revenues of million and million earned during and  respectively 
the increase in noninterest revenues resulted primarily from a greater amount of exit and release fees  and prepayment penalties in connection with loans repaid during the period  which offset reductions in income from real estate operations 
nonaccrual loans were million at december   or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  at december  included in nonaccrual loans at december   were five single family residential loans with balances greater than million representing million  or of total nonaccrual loans  and one commercial loan with a million balance  or of total nonaccrual loans  at december  see asset quality section for further discussion of nonaccrual loans 
the average loan to value ltv for these five loans was 
other classified loans were million at december  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the company incurred million in other non operating expenses during  of which million related to amounts paid  or reserved for payment  in connection with ongoing litigation and or satisfaction of judgments against the company  and for severance for the former ceo 
during  the company incurred minimal non operating expenses primarily related to losses on the sale of certain fixed assets 
the company s effective tax rate was and during and  respectively  reflecting utilization of accumulated federal income tax benefits  principally tax loss carry forwards  during by comparison  the company recorded income tax benefits of million in  which reflected the company s utilization of income tax benefits 
these income tax benefits  which consisted principally of tax loss carryforwards  accumulated during the early s  a period during which the company incurred substantial losses 
the following table shows average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  related revenues and costs  and effective weighted average yields and costs for each of the three years ended december  the interest costs associated with the company s issues of senior notes are included in the table

net interest income the operations of the company are substantially dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income received from its interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net interest margin is its net interest income divided by its average interest earning assets 
net interest income and net interest margin are affected by several factors  including the level of  and the relationship between  the dollar amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relationship between the repricing or maturity of the company s adjustable rate and fixed rate loans and short term investment securities and its deposits and borrowings  and the magnitude of the company s noninterest earning assets  including nonaccrual loans and real estate owned reo properties 
the company recorded net interest income of million  million and million in   and respectively  representing increases of and in and the resulting net interest margin increased during the three years to in from in and the increase in net interest income was primarily due to significant growth in earning assets  which was a direct result of the bank s continuing successful pursuit of the real estate secured financing business 
for the twelve months ended december   average earning assets were billion  an increase of over average earning assets of billion during average total loans  net of deferred fees  grew to billion in  an increase of over billion in average total loans  net of deferred fees in total assets reached billion at december   reflecting a growth rate of above total assets of billion at december  for the twelve months ended december   average earning assets were billion  an increase of over average earning assets of billion during average total loans  net of deferred fees  grew to billion in  an increase of over billion in average total loans  net of deferred fees in total assets reached billion at december   reflecting a growth rate of above total assets of billion at december  the following tables set forth the dollar amount of changes in interest revenues and interest costs attributable to changes in the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and changes in interest rates 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in volume ie  changes in volume multiplied by old rate  changes in rate ie  changes in rate multiplied by old volume and changes attributable to both rate and volume

includes the interest on non performing loans only to the extent that it was paid and recognized as interest income 
the company s interest revenues increased by million  or  during the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in the average balance of loans outstanding  which was partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average yield on earning assets  which averaged during compared to during and during the primary reason for the decline in the yield in the loan portfolio is due to lower yielding loans being added to the loan portfolio during  and  reflecting the increased competitive rate pressure in the marketplace and a change in the portfolio mix 
in addition  higher yielding loans have been paying off during and  adding to the overall yield decline 
interest costs increased by million  or  during the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period during  primarily due to a increase in the average balance of the company s interest bearing liabilities 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average rates paid on the company s deposits and fhlb advances  which together averaged for the twelve months ended december  compared to during the same period of and at december   certificates of deposit totaled million  or of total deposits  down from million  or of total deposits at december  this reduced reliance on certificates of deposit had a positive impact on the company s cost of funds and was achieved by capitalizing on the bank s strong community involvement 
provision for estimated credit losses provisions for estimated credit losses were million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
the company s ratio of charge offs to average loans has improved from in to in  and has remained at a consistent level of in additionally  total classified assets to bank core capital and general allowance for estimated credit losses have decreased from in to in average loans outstanding during increased by million  or  while loan provisions grew by million  or  over provisions 
the increase in the level of provision for estimated credit losses reflects management s intention to increase the ratio of the company s general valuation reserves to approximately of net loans by the end of  a level deemed by management to be prudent in view of the significant growth in the company s loan portfolio since  the relative lack of seasoning of many of the company s loans  and the significant amount of construction loans in the company s loan portfolio directed at financing real estate development 
the company achieved a ratio of the general allowance for estimated credit losses to loans receivable  net of specific reserves  of as of december  compared to and as of december  and  respectively 
see asset quality for a more complete discussion of the company s allowance for estimated credit losses 
although the company maintains its allowance for credit losses at a level which it considers to be adequate to provide for potential losses  based on conditions known at present  there can be no assurance that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations 
the calculation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  and therefore the requisite amount of provision for credit losses  is based on several factors  including underlying loan collateral values  delinquency trends and historical loan loss experience  all of which can change without notice based on market and economic conditions and other factors 
noninterest revenues noninterest income totaled million in  an increase of million  or from  which increased million  or  from detail and discussion of noninterest revenues by category is reflected below 
year ended december  dollars in thousands noninterest revenues loan related fees    gain loss on sales of investment securities other  total    loan related fees primarily consist of fees collected from borrowers for the early repayment of their loans  for the extension of the maturity of loans predominantly short term construction loans  with respect to which extension options are often included in the original term of the company s loan and in connection with certain loans which contain exit or release fees payable to the company upon the maturity or repayment of the company s loan 
the prepayment of a large number of loans to which prepayment penalties were attached  and the repayment of a small number of loans requiring exit fees  created an increase in prepayments in during the last half of  the sharp drop in market interest rates increased the volume of prepayments and refinancings during the first half of noninterest expenses general and administrative costs general and administrative expenses totaled million in  an increase of million  or from  which increased million  or  from detail and discussion of noninterest expenses by category is reflected below

during  and  the company employed an average of  and full time equivalent individuals  respectively 
the corresponding growth in employee related expenses  which consist primarily of base salaries  incentive compensation and the company s share of benefit expenses  was substantially less than the growth in the dollar amount of the company s net interest income 
other operating expenses include advertising  telephone and postage  stationery and supplies  bank and item processing charges and insurance 
the million  or  increase in operating expenses from to was primarily due to increased advertising and marketing activities to support the overall growth of the company 
increases in occupancy expenses were attributed to leasehold improvements at the corporate headquarters 
technology costs increased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in  a decrease of over costs 
technology costs during were principally costs associated with computer hardware and software maintenance costs  depreciation for computer hardware  and amortization of costs related to software 
in addition to the costs identified during  technology costs during included costs associated with systems conversions  from an outsourced third party vendor  to an internal system  and data processing charges from an outside vendor during the first half of technology costs during were primarily related to maintenance and depreciation for computer hardware and data processing service charges from an outside vendor 
professional fees increased million during the twelve months ended december  when compared to the same period of professional fees included expenses of million related to outside lawyers  who represent the company in a variety of legal matters due to additional litigation and trials 
the remaining professional fees consisted of the company s independent accountants  various other vendors that provide employee search and other professional fees related to operational projects 
during  the company implemented a core technology platform conversion from an outsourced mainframe provider to a client server platform 
the platform conversion  including year compliance initiatives  were substantially completed in accordingly  other professional and consulting fees decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of over costs 
saif insurance premium and ots assessment increased from million in to million in the company pays premiums to the saif based upon the dollar amount of deposits it holds and the assessment rate charged by the fdic  which is based upon the company s financial condition  its capital ratios and the rating it receives in connection with annual regulatory examinations by the ots

improved market conditions and the sale of large land parcels resulted in increased gains during property operations principally include the net operating income collected rental revenues less operating expenses and certain renovation costs from foreclosed income producing properties or receipt of similar funds held by receivers during the period the original loan was in default 
during the year ended december   the company sold properties generating net cash proceeds of million and a net gain of million  as compared to sales of properties generating net cash proceeds of million and a net gain of million during the year ended december  and a net gain of million during the same period of during the company recorded additional provisions for estimated losses on reo of million  principally in connection with the completion and liquidation of certain tract developments 
at december   the company had liquidated all of its investments in these tract developments 
income taxes the company recorded an income tax provision of million during compared to million during and compared to an income tax benefit of million during the company s effective tax rate was and during and  respectively 
the company returned to taxable status during  following several years in which it realized substantial income tax benefits from utilization of accumulated operating loss carry forwards 
the million of income tax benefit recognized during the year ended december   was due to a million increase in the company s deferred tax asset as a result of the reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
partially reducing this benefit was an expected liability of million attributable to the company s profitable operations 
year readiness in  the company adopted a year plan and created a year committee 
the main objectives of this process were to detect and resolve any problems that could occur on january   and ensure that the company was ready to conduct business as usual on january  rollover testing occurred from december  to january  no significant issues were identified 
the last phase of the company s year plan entailed leap year testing 
no significant issues were identified 
the expense incurred by the company to ensure year compliance was substantially integrated and was included with the expense associated with the planned conversion of its computer based systems 
the company incurred approximately million in costs related to its data processing conversion and implementation of the year plan 
approximately million of these costs were expensed during the company capitalized million of the total costs  which are amortized over a three year period  and expensed the remaining million of the total costs during the costs were in line with the original projections and the company does not anticipate any additional expenses in fiscal year related to the year project 
balance sheet analysis the company s total assets at december  were billion  an increase of million  or  over december  as of december   asset growth was reflected in all categories of interest earning assets  with the exception of investment securities 
loan receivables and fhlb stock reflected the largest growth  increasing by million and million  respectively  over the steady growth in loans was funded through core deposit growth and borrowings from the fhlb 
the increased fhlb borrowings necessitated an additional investment in fhlb stock 
deposits increased by year over year to billion from billion  with transaction accounts increasing million  or  to million at december  from million at december  at december   certificates of deposit totaled million  or of total deposits  down from of total deposits  or million at december  this reduced reliance on certificates of deposit has had a positive impact on the company s cost of funds 
stockholders equity and regulatory capital the company s capital consists of common stockholders equity  which amounted to million  or of total assets at december  compared to million  or of total assets at december  management is committed to maintaining capital at a level sufficient to assure shareholders  customers  and regulators that the company and its bank subsidiary are financially sound 
the company and the bank are subject to risk based capital regulations adopted by the federal banking regulators in january these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures 
according to the regulations  institutions whose tier and total capital ratios meet or exceed and  respectively  are deemed well capitalized

its requisite obligations  which pertain to its debt and operations  are dependent upon its sole source of funds  which is dividends from the bank 
the company s liquidity position refers to the extent to which the company s funding sources are sufficient to meet its current and long term cash requirements 
federal regulations currently require savings associations to maintain a monthly average daily balance of liquid assets equal to of the average daily balance of its net withdrawable accounts and short term borrowings during the preceding calendar quarter 
the bank has liquidity ratios of and for december and  respectively 
the company s current primary funding resources are deposit accounts  principal payments on loans  proceeds from sales of reo  advances from the fhlb and cash flows from operations 
other possible sources of liquidity available to the company include whole loan sales  commercial bank lines of credit  and direct access  under certain conditions  to borrowings from the federal reserve system 
the cash needs of the company are principally for the payment of interest on and withdrawals of deposit accounts  the funding of loans  operating costs and expenses  and holding and refurbishment costs on reo 
in march  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the common stock or approximately of the shares outstanding in open market transactions or privately negotiated purchases 
to date  the company has repurchased  shares 
liquidity ots regulations require a savings institution to maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets including cash and cash equivalents  and certain marketable securities that are not committed equal to at least of either the average daily balance of its net withdrawable accounts and short term borrowings during the preceding calendar quarter  or the amount of its net withdrawable accounts and short term borrowings at the end of its preceding calendar quarter 
under firrea  this liquidity requirement may be changed from time to time by the ots to any amount within the range of to of such accounts and borrowings depending upon economic conditions and the deposit flows of the member associations 
monetary penalties may be imposed for failure to meet this liquidity ratio requirement 
the company s average liquidity for the quarter ending december   was  which exceeds the applicable requirements 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk irr and credit risk constitute the two greatest sources of financial exposure for insured financial institutions 
please refer to item business  lending activities  for a thorough discussion of the company s lending activities 
irr represents the impact that changes in absolute and relative levels of market interest rates may have upon the company s net interest income nii and theoretical liquidation value  also referred to as net portfolio value npv 
npv is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities 
changes in the nii the net interest spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are influenced to a significant degree by the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
the company realizes income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments  other interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the volumes and yields on loans  deposits and borrowings are affected by market interest rates 
as of december   of the company s loan portfolio was tied to adjustable rate indices  such as cofi  prime  cmt  mta and libor 
the majority of the company s deposits are time deposits with a stated maturity generally one year or less and a fixed rate of interest 
the borrowings from the fhlb also carry a fixed interest rate for a term of up to years  although the weighted average maturity of the borrowings as of december   was four years and six months 
changes in the market level of interest rates directly and immediately affect the company s interest spread  and therefore profitability 
sharp and significant changes to market rates can cause the interest spread to shrink or expense significantly in the near term  principally because of the timing differences between the adjustable rate loans and the maturities and therefore repricing of the deposits and borrowings 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing the company s assets and liabilities in a manner that balances profitability  irr and various other risks including liquidity 
alco operates under policies and within risk limits prescribed by  reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
alco seeks to stabilize the company s nii and npv by matching its rate sensitive assets and liabilities through maintaining the maturity and repricing of these assets and liabilities at appropriate levels given the interest rate environment 
when the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds rate sensitive assets within specified time periods  the nii generally will be negatively impacted by increasing rates and positively impacted by decreasing rates 
conversely  when the amount of rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of rate sensitive liabilities within specified time periods  net interest income will generally be positively impacted by increasing rates and negatively impacted by decreasing rates 
the speed and velocity of the repricing of assets and liabilities will also contribute to the effects on the company s nii and npv  as will the presence or absence of periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors 
the company utilizes two methods for measuring interest rate risk  gap analysis and interest rate simulations 
gap analysis focuses on measuring absolute dollar amounts subject to repricing within certain periods of time  particularly the one year maturity horizon 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s 
interest rate simulations are produced using a software model that is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the company s financial instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on current volumes of applicable financial instruments 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and  consequently  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
interest rate simulations provide the company with an estimate of both the dollar amount and percentage change in nii under various rate scenarios 
all assets and liabilities are subjected to tests of up to basis points in increases and decreases in interest rates 
under each interest rate scenario  the company projects its net interest income and the npv of its current balance sheet 
from these results  the company can then develop alternatives in dealing with the tolerance thresholds 
since  the company has been utilizing interest rate floors to mitigate the risk of interest margin compression on its new loans in a decreasing rate environment 
additionally  on most new income property loans  the company utilizes interest rate caps 
these are life caps and are usually five points above the rate at underwriting or at an amount that would still allow for one to one debt service coverage at the maximum rate  thereby reducing the likelihood of borrower default in a rising rate environment 
the risk to the company associated with the interest rate floors is that interest rates may decline  and the borrower may choose to refinance the loan  either with the company or with another financial institution  resulting in the company having to replace the higher yielding asset at a lower rate 
the risk to the company associated with interest rate caps is that interest rates will exceed the maximum rates on such loans  and while the company s cost of funds continues to rise  the interest income derived from these loans will be fixed  resulting in an overall compression on net interest income 
a traditional  although analytically limited measure of a financial institution s irr is the static gap 
static gap is the difference between the amount of assets and liabilities adjusted for any off balance positions which are expected to mature or reprice within a specific period 
generally  a positive gap benefits an institution during periods of rising interest rates  and a negative gap benefits an institution during periods of declining interest rates 
however  because the indices that the company s loan products are priced to may lag changes in market interest rates by three months or more  the company s net interest income may not reflect changes in interest rates immediately 
the table below sets forth information concerning repricing opportunities for the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  the amount of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with their contractual maturities  except that adjustable rate products are included in the period in which they are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature 
such assets and liabilities are classified by the earlier of their maturity or repricing date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company realizes income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments  other interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while structuring the company s asset liability mix to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact the company s income to the extent that the interest rates borne by the assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the company has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor its interest rate risk exposure 
as a part of this effort  the company uses the net portfolio value npv methodology to gauge interest rate risk exposure 
using an internally generated model  the company monitors interest rate sensitivity by estimating the change in npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cashflows on interest earning assets and other assets  and the outgoing cashflows on interest bearing liabilities and other liabilities 
the npv ratio is defined as the npv for a given rate scenario divided by the market value of the assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  whichever produces the largest decline 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure  the greater is considered its exposure to irr 
the ots also produces a similar analysis using its own model  based upon data submitted on the bank s quarterly thrift financial report tfr 
at december   based on the company s internally generated model  it was estimated that the company s npv would decrease in the event of a basis point increase in rates  and increase by if rates were to decrease by basis points 
presented below  as of december   is an analysis of the company s irr as measured in the npv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of   and basis point increments in market interest rates 
net portfolio value change change change from from in rates amount basecase ratio basecase dollars in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp management believes that the npv methodology overcomes three shortcomings of the typical maturity gap methodology 
first  it does not use arbitrary repricing intervals and accounts for all expected cash flows  weighing each by its appropriate discount factor 
second  because the npv method projects cash flows of each financial instrument under different rate environments  it can incorporate the effect of embedded options on an association s irr exposure 
third  it allows interest rates on different instruments to change by varying amounts in response to a change in market interest rates  resulting in more accurate estimates of cash flows 
on a quarterly basis  the results of the internally generated model are reconciled to the results of the ots model 
historically the ots has valued the npv higher  but the changes in npv as a result of the rate increases and decreases are directionally consistent between the two models 
the difference between the two models resides in the prepayment assumptions and the ability of the company to analyze each individual rate index in a changing environment 
through the inclusion of more specific information regarding the company s unique loan portfolio  the internal model reflects less sensitivity in an increasing rate environment  and greater sensitivity in a declining rate environment
