item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations income statement comparison the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss analysis of compared to change change net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    operating expenses    operating income loss    other income expense    income loss before income taxes    n a income tax provision benefit    n a net income loss    n a revenues the company experienced encouraging growth in net sales during primarily due to the absorption of a portion of tandycrafts abandoned market share and the early signs of renewed interest in the western apparel and craft markets 
in addition  we opened four new sales distribution units in  located in portland  or  billings  mt  austin  tx  and tucson  az 
it has been our experience that the western and craft industries are subject to fads  to some extent 
movies  entertainers  etc 
have a great impact on the popularity of western apparel in particular 
the key to success in the craft industry  oversimplifying of course  is being the first company with a popular idea whether it be wearable art  photo albums and scrapbook creations  etc 
as a result  the company s success in selling to these two industries depends to a point on the latest successful craft idea  what is popular at the box office  or who won entertainer of the year 
we believe we are seeing the beginnings of these two industries popularity on the rise 
partially offsetting the sales increases in retail  western and craft markets was the continued reduction of sales of certain low margin items 
because of the historically low margins earned in our shoe care repair product line  we intentionally eliminated a large portion of the line 
this reduced sales to this industry by approximately million from we compensated for this reduction with the development and implementation of our new asc program 
the asc program began in april  and as of december   we had approximately approved ascs 
in  the ascs generated sales of over  we are pleased with the success of this program and anticipate continued growth in sales in our institutional prisons and prisoners  schools  hospitals  etc 
and other core markets saddle and tack  semi professional hobbyists  small manufacturers are showing steady and positive growth trends as well 
costs  gross profit  and expenses cost of sales for totaled million or of sales 
the percentage increase over was 
the impact of this increase becomes evident when compared to the increase in sales 
the gain in gross profit to sales in resulted in a gross profit percentage of the highest in the company s history compared to in the most significant factor supporting this improvement is the increase in our retail business as retail sales historically produce the highest profit margins 
this year  we experienced a jump in retail sales from operating expenses increased million or compared to this increase is a result of higher payroll costs resulting from higher sales  esop contribution management s desire to reward employees for the company s financial improvement  managers bonuses as a result of higher profits earned at the sales distribution units  and professional fees 
other income expense other expenses were down from this reduction is primarily in interest expense due to the decrease in average outstanding debt balances in as compared to provision benefit for income taxes the provision for federal and state income taxes was of income before taxes due to  of non deductible expenses  principally amortization of goodwill 
without these non deductible expenses  the company s effective tax rate approximates the company s historical rate for combined federal  state and local income taxes of

sales of lower margin items predominately our shoe care repair line were down from and represented less than of total revenues in nearly half of the company s business is made up of sales to western apparel and crafts markets  and sales in these markets were down and  respectively  compared to  reflecting a continuation of negative industry trends 
however  sales in the company s core businesses and institutional markets remained strong throughout the year and registered an increase in revenues over costs  gross profit  and expenses cost of sales for totaled million or of sales 
the comparable amount for was million or 
the improvement in the percentage was principally attributable to an improved product sales mix and the company s strategic efforts to selectively raise prices and eliminate lower margin items from its product lines 
as a result of the lower cost of sales percentage  gross profit as a percentage of sales improved in to compared to of 
operating expenses decreased  or to million in from million in approximately half of the decrease in operating expenses was the result of lower payroll costs  reflecting an additional reduction of personnel during other decreases included lower advertising costs  reduced accounting  legal and professional fees  and lower freight costs 
other income expense other expenses were  for compared to  during interest expense was up  in as the amortization of deferred costs from the november debt refinancing offset reduced interest expense due to lower borrowing levels during the year 
other income increased  relative to due to a gain from the sale of a trademark in as opposed to a loss recorded on the sale of real estate in tampa  florida in provision benefit for income taxes the benefit for income taxes was of the loss before taxes in the tax benefit reflects a deduction for a contribution to the company s esop for tax purposes in excess of its treatment in arriving at net income 
this amount is partly offset by certain non deductible expenses totaling  principally the amortization of goodwill 
taking these two amounts into account  the company s effective tax rate materially approximates the company s historical rate for combined federal and state income taxes of 
capital resources and liquidity on november   the company entered into a credit and security agreement with wells fargo business credit  inc wfbc  in which wfbc agreed to provide a credit facility of up to  the credit facility 
the credit facility has a three year term and is secured by all of the assets of the company 
the initial borrowings from wfbc were used to pay all amounts due by the company to finova capital corporation finova and the schlinger foundation schlinger as discussed below 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions contained in the credit facility and has no reason to believe that it will not continue to operate in compliance with the provisions of these financing arrangements 
the principal terms and conditions of the credit facility are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
prior to the relationship with wfbc  the company had a loan and security agreement with finova in which finova agreed to provide a credit facility of up to  in senior debt the senior debt facility 
this senior debt facility was secured by all of the assets of the company as well as a pledge of  shares of the company s common stock  par value common stock  collectively owned by two of the company s executive officers 
the company also had a  subordinated promissory note with schlinger the subordinated debenture which was secured by a pledge of  shares of the company s common stock owned by another executive officer 
the primary sources of liquidity and capital resources during were borrowings from the debt facilities with finova and wfbc  and cash flows provided by operating activities 
cash flows from operations for were  the largest portion of the operating cash flow was invested in inventory to meet demand from increased sales 
accounts receivable increased to million and inventory increased to million at december  from  and  respectively  at december  the aging of accounts receivable has increased slightly from we believe that this trend is temporary and is a result primarily of the speed at which receivables grew in a relatively short period of time 
we continue to maintain a rather tight credit and collection policy and expect improved collection results in inventory turned times during  improving over the ratio of times 
however  this turn rate is still below management s goals of over turns per year 
management believes the rate would have been higher if we had not intentionally raised the inventory levels in the last half of the year to meet anticipated demand as the tandycrafts store closings were completed 
in december  we completed the implementation of our new information system which is proving to be very helpful in the monitoring of inventory levels as we go forward 
accounts payable increased to million at december  from million at the end of due to the increase in inventory purchases and the more favorable terms negotiated with certain vendors 
the increase in accounts payable created approximately  of operating cash flow for the year to help offset the negative effect on cash flow due to the increase in accounts receivable and inventory 
the company s current ratio remained fairly constant at december  and and  respectively 
if  however  accounting rules had not required the company s debt with wfbc to be classified as short term even though the maturity is in november  the current ratio at december  would have been 
the largest use of cash beyond inventory  accounts receivable  and debt payments in was for capital expenditures 
cash used for capital expenditures totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately of capital spending was for new computer equipment and software with the remainder split between office and warehouse fixtures  machinery and other equipment  and leasehold improvements 
the company s credit facility consists of a revolving credit facility and one term note 
the revolving portion is based upon the level of the company s accounts receivable and inventory 
at december   the company had additional borrowing availability of approximately  continued sales increases and operations expansion will require larger investments in accounts receivable and inventory 
management believes the current credit facility in place with wfbc  combined with operating cash flow  will be adequate to fund operation and expansion needs 
the company borrows and repays funds under revolving credit terms as needed

an increase of one percentage point in the prime rate would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings
