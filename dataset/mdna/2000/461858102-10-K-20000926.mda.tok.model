in addition  any statements that refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements in this document include  but are not necessarily limited to  those relating to the company s intention to further penetrate the broad patient monitoring market the anticipated growth in medical applications of mri equipment the company s expectations for growth in mri unit sales the company s success in developing new or enhanced products to take advantage of market opportunities or to respond to competition the company s ability to complete any future acquisitions of products or businesses the company s belief that patient monitors will become an integral component of mri equipment the company is not obligated to update or revise these forward looking statements to reflect new events or circumstances 
factors that could cause actual results  events or circumstances to differ from forward looking statements made in this report include those set forth in the following risk factors section 
risk factors risks relating to the company s business the company is dependent on a concentrated line of products the company s future financial performance will be largely dependent on its patient monitor product line  which includes a limited number of products 
the company expects its recently introduced omni trak mri patient monitor and its millennia portable patient monitor to have a substantial impact on revenue growth 
in the mri monitoring market  the success of its omni trak is heavily dependent on the continued acceptance of mri technology as a diagnostic tool 
in the general patient monitoring market  the company s millennia monitor is heavily dependent on its ability to penetrate an already competitive market 
in addition  the recent consolidation in the medical care provider market has resulted in a number of very large purchasers of medical devices 
these large purchasers typically prefer to establish relationships with medical device manufacturers that have broad and diverse product lines 
the failure of the company s products to continue to gain market acceptance or a continued consolidation of the medical care provider market could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company faces increased levels of competition the company has encountered and will continue to encounter significant competition in the sale of its products 
the company s general patient monitoring competitors include a number of large multinational corporations 
some of these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than the company can 
in the mri patient monitoring market  the company has enjoyed a significant first to market advantage over its competitors 
however  competitors have introduced products designed to compete with its mri vital signs monitoring products 
in addition  as the market for mri vital signs monitoring products expands it may attract competitors with greater resources 
additionally  competition may increase if new companies enter the company s markets or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines 
the introduction of competitive products may result in a decrease in the company s market share and in a decrease in the prices at which the company is able to sell its products 
the company s market share could also be adversely affected by increasing concentration in the medical care provider market 
any decrease in the company s market share or decrease in the prices at which the company is able to sell its products could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company s financial results may fluctuate the company s financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period because of a variety of factors  many of which is beyond its control 
these factors include increased competition changes in the company s pricing policies and those of its competitors changes in the company s operating expenses or capital expenditures timing and market acceptance of new and upgraded product introductions by the company and its competitors seasonal fluctuations in the demand for the company s products introduction of alternative technologies by the company and its competitors effect of potential acquisitions other general economic factors fluctuations caused by these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company is subject to a significant risk of new laws related to health care changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a significant effect on the company s costs of doing business and the amount of reimbursement the company receives from both government and third party payors 
in addition  economic forces  regulatory influences and political initiatives are subjecting the health care industry to fundamental changes 
health care reform proposals have been formulated by the current administration and by members of congress 
federal  state and local government representatives are likely to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methods 
the company expects ongoing public debate on these issues 
any of these efforts or reforms could have a material adverse affect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s business is subject to technological change and introduction of new products technological change  evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements characterize the markets for the company s products 
many of the company s products and products under development are technologically innovative  and therefore require significant planning  design  development and testing 
these activities require the company to make significant capital commitments and investments 
in addition  industry standards may change on short notice and new products and technologies may render existing products and technologies uncompetitive 
additionally  the products that the company is currently developing  and those that the company develops in the future  may not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace or they may not be completed in an acceptable time frame 
any increased capital investments or loss in sales due to technological change could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company currently is involved in a legal proceeding the company s medical device subsidiary  invivo research  was one of two third party defendants named in a lawsuit in june of by southern nevada surgical center and surgex southern nevada  inc in nevada state district court 
the underlying action in this matter stemmed from an incident involving a surgical patient undergoing a procedure at the southern nevada surgical center 
the patient suffered a serious permanent brain injury 
a lawsuit was filed on behalf of the patient against the surgical center and the anesthesiologist who monitored the patient 
the defendants in that action made a substantial settlement to the patient 
southern nevada surgical center snsc and surgex were seeking indemnity and contribution of approximately million from the manufacturer of the anesthetic gas machine and invivo research  which manufactured the vital signs monitor used in this procedure 
snsc and surgex alleged that both the anesthetic gas machine and the vital signs monitor were defective 
the company believes that the vital signs monitor operated properly and was properly designed for its intended function 
on august   the nevada district court granted the company s motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute 
the order granted dismissal of the snsc and surgex contribution claims  without prejudice  based upon nevada law that provides that an action must be brought to trial within five years of the date of the filing of the original action 
the dismissal is being appealed 
in april of  the plaintiff s insurer  cna  filed an action with identical causes in the same nevada state court 
this second action was removed by the company to us district court 
the action by cna was dismissed by the district court on january  the dismissal is being appealed 
any judgment against the company that exceeds the amount that its insurer is required to pay could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company faces product liability and product recall risks with respect to all of its products  and particularly its medical devices  the company faces the risk of potentially large product liability claims 
the malfunction or misuse of its products could potentially result in serious harm to a patient 
in addition  the company may be required to indemnify its distributors and customers for similar claims made against them 
claims could be made against the company even if its products did not contribute to the injury that was sustained 
frequently  the company s products are used with products developed by other manufacturers 
even if its products are not the cause of the injury  the company may not be able to prove that some other product malfunction or human error caused a claimant s injury 
the company has had product liability claims made against it in the past and may have further claims made against it in the future 
while the company is insured for certain product liability claims  not all claims will be covered and the level of its insurance may not be sufficient to protect us from the full amount of a successful claim 
in addition  the company may not be able to obtain adequate amounts of insurance at an acceptable cost 
claims made against the company that are not insured  or that exceed the amount of the company s coverage  could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
similarly  the company s products are subject to the potential of being recalled by government agencies for actual or potential deficiencies or problems 
any such recall would likely be expensive and would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company faces increased risks of international operations international sales have accounted for over of the company s sales for each of the past three years and may increase over time 
international sales are subject to a number of risks  including the following fluctuations in exchange rates may affect the demand for products and services the company provides in foreign markets adverse changes in local economic conditions  such as those recently occurring in asian and south american countries  could depress the demand for the company s products agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign country s legal system foreign customers may have longer payment cycles foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax the company s foreign income  impose tariffs  or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade us export licenses may be difficult to obtain the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is that of currency risk 
during the year ended june   of the company s total sales came from non united states domiciled customers 
the company requires payment in united states us currency 
if these customers currency devalues against the us dollar  the customers could potentially encounter difficulty in making the us dollar denominated payments
