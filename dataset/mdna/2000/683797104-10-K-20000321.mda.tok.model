the securities industry is highly competitive and sensitive to many factors and is directly affected by general economic and market conditions  including the volatility and price level of securities markets  the volume  size  and timing of securities transactions  the demand for investment banking services and changes in interest rates  all of which have an impact on commissions  trading and investment income as well as on liquidity 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s expenses are relatively fixed and do not vary with market activity 
consequently  substantial fluctuations can occur in the company s revenues and net income from period to period due to these and other factors 
the company anticipates increasing competition from commercial banks and thrift institutions as these institutions begin to offer more investment banking and financial services traditionally only provided by securities firms 
the growing use of discount brokerage firms by investors has impacted traditional retail commission business and the presence of on line trading over the internet  including such services presently being offered by full service securities firms  has begun to significantly impact the means by which retail clients place their orders 
the company is also experiencing increasing regulation in the securities industry  particularly affecting the over the counter markets  making compliance with regulations more difficult and costly 
at present  the company is unable to predict the extent of changes  or the effect on the company s business 
the company s long term plan is to continue to expand existing offices by hiring experienced professionals  thus maximixing the potential of each office and development of existing trading  investment banking  investment advisory and other activities 
equally important is the search for viable corporations for acquisition 
as opportunities are presented  it is the intention of the company to pursue growth by acquisition where a comfortable match can be found in terms of corporate goals and personnel and at a price that would provide the company s shareholders with value

inflation because the assets of the company s brokerage subsidiaries are highly liquid  and because securities inventories are carried at current market values  the impact of inflation generally is reflected in the financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the company s principal business activities by their nature involve significant market and credit risks 
the company s effectiveness in managing these risks is critical to its success and stability 
as part of its normal business operations  the company engages in the trading of both fixed income and equity securities in both a proprietary and market making capacity 
the company makes markets in over the counter equities in order to facilitate order flow and accommodate its institutional and retail customers 
the company also makes markets in municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities  government bonds and high yield bonds 
market risk market risk generally means the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent in all types of financial instruments  including both derivatives and non derivatives 
the company s exposure to market risk arises from its role as a financial intermediary for its customers transactions and from its proprietary trading and arbitrage activities 
see additional discussion of risk management in item 
in addition  the company s activities expose it to operational risk  legal risk and funding risk 
operational risk generally means the risk of loss resulting from improper processing of transactions or deficiencies in the company s operating systems or internal controls 
with respect to its trading activities  the company has procedures designed to ensure that all transactions are accurately recorded and properly reflected on the company s books on a timely basis 
with respect to client activities  the company operates a system of internal controls designed to ensure that transactions and other account activity new account solicitation  transaction authorization  transaction processing  billing and collection are properly approved  processed  recorded and reconciled 
legal risk generally includes the risk of non compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the risk that a counterparty s obligations are unenforceable 
the company is subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions in which it conducts its business 
through its legal advisors and its compliance department  the company has established routines to ensure compliance with regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  new products  use and safekeeping of customer securities and funds  granting of credit  collection activities  and record keeping 
the company has procedures designed to assess and monitor counterparty risk 
for a discussion of funding risk  see liquidity and capital resources  above 
credit risk credit risk arises from non performance by trading counterparties  customers and issuers of debt securities held in the company s inventory 
the company manages this risk by imposing and monitoring position limits  regularly reviewing trading counterparties  monitoring and limiting securities concentrations  marking positions to market on a daily basis to evaluate and establish the adequacy of collateral  and with respect to trading counterparties  conducting business through clearing corporations which guarantee performance 
further discussion of credit risk appears in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  see item value at risk value at risk is a statistical measure of the potential loss in the fair value of a portfolio due to adverse movements in underlying risk factors 
in response to the securities and exchange commission s market risk disclosure requirements  the company has performed a value at risk analysis of its trading financial instruments and derivatives 
the value at risk calculation uses standard statistical techniques to measure the potential loss in fair value based upon a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the calculation is based upon a variance covariance methodology  which assumes a normal distribution of changes in portfolio value 
the forecasts of variances and co variances used to construct the model  for the market factors relevant to the portfolio  were generated from historical data 
although value at risk models are sophisticated tools  their use can be limited as historical data is not always an accurate predictor of future conditions 
the company attempts to manage its market exposure using other methods  including trading authorization limits and concentration limits 
at december  and  the company s value at risk for each component of market risk was as follows december  s omitted high low average interest rate risk equity price risk diversification benefit total the potential future loss presented by the total value at risk generally falls within predetermined levels of loss that should not be material to the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the changes in the value at risk amounts reported in from those reported in reflect changes in the size and composition of the company s trading portfolio  more particularly a decrease in the overall size of the company s portfolio  both long and short values  at december  compared to december  in addition  in  the company reduced the number of securities in which it makes a market and limited its exposure in a single security 
further discussion of risk management appears in item  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and item  risk management 
the value at risk estimate has limitations that should be considered in evaluating the company s potential future losses based on the year end portfolio positions 
recent market conditions including increased volatility  may result in statistical relationships that result in higher value at risk than would be estimated from the same portfolio under different market conditions  or the converse may be true 
critical risk management strategy involves the active management of portfolio levels to reduce market risk 
the company s market risk exposure is continuously monitored as the portfolio risks and market conditions change
