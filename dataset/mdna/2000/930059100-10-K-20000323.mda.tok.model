results of operations overview the company derives its revenues primarily from providing investment management  distribution and administrative services to the united  w r and target united funds and institutional accounts 
investment management fees  the company s most substantial source of revenue  are based on the amount of assets under management and are affected by sales levels  financial market conditions  redemptions and the composition of assets 
underwriting and distribution revenues consist of sales charges and commissions derived from sales of investment and insurance products and distribution fees 
the products sold have various sales charge structures and the revenues received from sales of products vary based on the type and amount sold 
rule b distribution fees earned for distributing shares of certain mutual funds are based upon a percentage of assets and fluctuate based on sales  redemptions  and financial market conditions 
service fees include transfer agency fees  custodian fees for retirement plan accounts and portfolio accounting fees 
in june of  the funds boards of directors approved the proposal to restructure the management fee arrangements of the funds 
this restructuring replaced the group fee structure and specific fund add on fee with a specific fee schedule for each fund 
the funds fee schedules include breakpoints at which fee rates decline as assets increase 
these schedules more closely conform with others in the mutual fund industry and as of year end it had a favorable impact on the company s overall management fee rate of approximately 
of mutual fund assets under management  which is expected to continue 
in october of  the company restructured its united funds and the w r funds 
commencing october  the united funds began offering class b shares back end sales charges and class c shares level sales charge shares 
these are in addition to the already offered class a shares front end sales charge shares and class y shares institutional shares 
concurrently  the w r funds began offering class c shares level sales charge shares 
these are in addition to the already offered class y shares institutional shares 
at the same time  the w r funds class b shares were no longer offered for new sales due to their non industry standard structure 
the existing w r funds class b shares will convert to w r fund class c shares in the first quarter of upon conversion of the w r fund class b shares  no contingent deferred sales charges will be collected for any converted share redemptions 
as a result of the discontinuation of the w r funds class b shares  the company wrote off million of deferred acquisition costs in the fourth quarter of the company expects that this restructuring of shares will enhance competitiveness and strategic distribution alternatives

average assets under management were billion for  an increase of compared with the asset growth rate exceeded the rate of increase in management fees due primarily to two factors 
first  certain mutual funds have breakpoints in their fee schedules which provide for reduced fee rates as assets grow  resulting in a slower rate of growth in revenues than growth in assets 
secondly  institutional assets  which generally have a lower management fee rate than mutual funds  constituted a higher percentage of total assets for underwriting and distribution fees over underwriting and distribution fees are comprised of commissions charged on sales of front load mutual funds  variable products and insurance products  and rule b asset based distribution fees and contingent deferred sales charges from back end and level load funds

in  shareholder service fees increased to million due primarily to a increase in the average number of accounts 
in addition  a fee increase in the fourth quarter of  coinciding with the outsourcing of the data processing component of transfer agency activities  caused the increase in revenues to exceed the increase in number of accounts serviced 
this fee increase contributed million to the growth in revenue in over the transfer agency fees and custodian fees comprised of the service fee revenue in in  shareholder service fees increased to million due primarily to an increase in the average number of accounts 
a fee increase in the fourth quarter of  coinciding with the outsourcing of the data processing component of transfer agency activities  caused the increase in revenues to exceed the increase in number of accounts serviced 
underwriting and distribution expense over underwriting and distribution expense includes costs associated with the marketing  promotion  and distribution of the company s products 
the primary costs are compensation paid to financial advisors  sales management and other marketing personnel  plus expenses relating to field offices  sales programs and advertising

upon conversion of the w r class b shares  no contingent deferred sales charges will be collected for any converted share redemptions 
the deferred selling costs of million related to the w r class b share conversion were written off on november th  concurrent with the necessary approvals for share conversion

over underwriting and distribution expense for was million  an increase of million or compared with these costs were higher than due primarily to growth in sales volume  an additional million of costs related to an advertising campaign that was implemented during the fourth quarter of  and an increase of approximately million related to enhancements to field compensation that were effective july  compensation and related costs over compensation and related costs for were million  an increase of million or compared to the average number of employees increased by as the company continued to invest in investment management  client service  and support personnel 
additional performance based compensation accounted for million of the increase in compensation costs due primarily to investment performance compensation paid to portfolio managers and to a lesser extent to the inclusion of middle management in incentive compensation plans 
higher pension and health insurance costs were additional factors for the increase in compensation costs 
pension and related costs were 
million higher due to personnel additions and a higher rate of compensation increase 
higher health insurance costs contributed million to the increase as reserves were increased to reflect higher claims exposure over compensation and related costs were up to million in due primarily to an increase in the average number of employees of 
higher performance based compensation and raises accounted for the remaining increase 
general and administrative expense over general and administrative expense  which reflects operating costs other than compensation and marketing  was up million or to million for approximately million of this increase was attributable to the implementation of a new transfer agency system in the fourth quarter of higher shareholder service fee revenue coinciding with this implementation offset most of the increased costs 
the growth of the company s operations added to higher administrative costs  including the acquisition of acf  new consulting arrangements  proxy and shareholder meeting costs  and additional facilities rental to accommodate growth

property and equipment increased by million or to million 
this increase was primarily the result of million in expenditures related to the ongoing construction of a building to be used for the company s home office operations and a million reclassification of land for the new building site previously classified as investment in real estate 
as previously disclosed  the company intends to sell the home office properties to a third party in and will enter into a lease for its home office operations

upon conversion of the w r class b shares  no contingent deferred sales charge will be collected for any converted share redemptions 
the deferred selling costs related to the w r funds class b shares in the amount of million were written off on november th  concurrent with the necessary approvals for share conversion 
by offering additional classes of mutual fund shares and closing funds with non industry standard structure  the restructuring will be more consistent with that of the industry  provide its clients with more choices and greater value  and accommodate additional changes for strategic distribution flexibility

the million  day revolving credit facility  expandable to million  had million outstanding at december  management believes its available cash  marketable securities  and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund dividends  operations  advance sales commissions  obligations  and other reasonably foreseeable cash needs 
the company may also continue to repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time as management deems appropriate 
the share repurchases could be financed by the company s available cash and investments and or the use of the company s revolving credit facility 
subsequent events from january  through march   the company repurchased  class a shares and  class b shares at an aggregate cost of million 
the company had previously expected to enter into a written agreement for the sale and leaseback of the home office properties to an unrelated party 
that particular transaction was not completed  however  the company plans to pursue other buyers for its home office properties in on february   the company announced a definitive agreement to acquire the legend group in a business combination to be accounted for as a purchase 
the legend group  through its network of more than financial advisors  serves employees of school districts and other not for profit organizations nationwide by providing distribution and retirement planning  primarily in the b market 
the company expects to acquire the legend group for a purchase price of million in cash and contingent cash payments over years of up to million 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets of the legend group will be amortized on a straight line basis over years 
the legend group has approximately  clients with billion in third party mutual fund assets  primarily in retirement plans

recent accounting developments in june of  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company 
information systems and year readiness the company believes its software programs and operating systems are year compliant and ready for use beyond the year the company is not currently aware of any material year problem relating to any of its material internal software programs or operating systems 
its internal operations and business are also dependent upon the computer controlled systems of third parties such as our suppliers  customers and other service providers 
the company believes that  absent a systemic failure outside its control  such as a prolonged loss of electrical or telecommunications service  year problems at third parties will not have a material impact on its operations 
the failure of the company s internal systems or the systems of third parties to be year ready could temporarily prevent the company from providing service to its customers and could require the company to devote significant resources to correct such problems 
the costs associated with remediating any year problems have not  in the opinion of management  been material to date 
although the company does anticipate that these costs will be material in the future  there can be no assurance that these costs will not be material 
seasonability and inflation the company does not believe its operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on operations 
risk factors there may be adverse effects on our revenues  earnings and prospects if the securities markets decline 
our results of operations are affected by certain economic factors  including the level of the securities markets 
we have benefited from the favorable performance of the securities markets in recent years which has attracted a substantial increase in the investments in the securities markets 
a decline in the securities markets  failure of the securities markets to sustain their recent levels of growth or short term volatility in the securities markets could result in investors withdrawing from the markets or decreasing their rate of investment  either of which could adversely affect our revenues  earnings and growth prospects 
because our revenues are  to a large extent  based on the value of assets under management  a decline in the value of these assets would adversely affect our revenues 
our growth is dependent to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain mutual fund assets and in an adverse economic environment  this may prove difficult 
our growth rate has varied from year to year and there can be no assurance that the average growth rates sustained in the recent past will continue 
there may be adverse effects on our revenues and earnings if our funds performance declines 
success in the investment management and mutual fund businesses is dependent on the investment performance of client accounts 
good performance stimulates sales of the funds shares and tends to keep redemptions low 
sales of the funds shares in turn generate higher management fees and distribution revenues 
good performance also attracts private institutional accounts 
conversely  poor performance results in decreased sales  increased redemptions of the funds shares  and the loss of private institutional accounts  resulting in decreases in revenues 
failure of our funds to perform well could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
there may be an adverse effect on our business if our investors remove the assets we manage on short notice 
a substantial majority of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements with our funds that are terminable on days notice 
each investment management agreement must be approved and renewed annually by the disinterested members of each fund s board or its shareholders 
some of these investment management agreements may be terminated or not renewed  and new agreements may be unavailable 
in addition  mutual fund investors may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without any prior notice 
investors can terminate their relationship with us  reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management  or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any of a number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance 
the decrease in revenues that could result from any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we face increased competition in hiring and retaining key personnel and sales force 
our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to conduct our fund management and investment advisory business 
the market for qualified fund managers  investment analysts  and financial advisors is extremely competitive and has grown more so in recent periods because of the growth in the industry 
we are dependent on our sales force to sell our mutual funds and other investment products 
our growth prospects will be directly affected by the quality and quantity of financial advisors we are able to successfully recruit and retain 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel 
we face strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies 
we compete with stock brokerage and investment banking firms  insurance companies  banks  online and internet investment sites and other financial institutions 
many of these companies not only offer mutual fund investments and services but also offer other financial products and services 
many of our competitors have more products and product lines  services  and may also have substantially greater assets under management 
many larger mutual fund complexes have developed relationships with brokerage houses with large distribution networks  which may enable these fund complexes to reach broader client bases 
in recent years  there has been a trend of consolidation in the mutual fund industry resulting in stronger competitors with greater financial resources than us 
there has also been a trend toward online internet financial services 
if existing customers stop investing with us and instead invest with our competitors  or if potential customers decide to invest with our competitors  it would cause our market share  revenues and income to decline 
potential misuse of funds and information in the possession of our advisors could result in liability to our clients 
our financial advisors handle a significant amount of funds and financial and personal information for our clients 
although we have implemented a system of controls to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of funds and information  there can be no assurance that our controls will be adequate or that a taking or misuse by our employees can be prevented 
we could have liability in the event of a taking or misuse by our employees and we could also be subject to regulatory sanctions 
although we believe that we have adequately insured against these risks  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be maintained or that it will be adequate to meet any future liability 
there are no assurances that we will pay future dividends 
our board of directors currently intends to continue to declare quarterly dividends on both our class a common stock and our class b common stock 
the declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors 
any determination as to the payment of dividends  as well as the level of such dividends  will depend on  among other things  general economic and business conditions  our strategic plans  our financial results and condition  contractual  legal  and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us or our subsidiaries 
we are a holding company and  as such  our ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of our subsidiaries to provide us cash 
there can be no assurance that the current quarterly dividend level will be maintained or that we will pay any dividends in any future period 
regulatory risk is substantial in our business 
our investment management business is heavily regulated 
noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in sanctions being levied against us  including fines and censures  suspension or expulsion from a certain jurisdiction or market or the revocation of licenses 
noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations would adversely effect our reputation  prospects  revenues and earnings 
in addition  changes in current laws or regulations or in governmental policies could adversely affect our operations  revenues and earnings 
provisions of our organizational documents could deter takeover attempts 
under our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority  without action by our stockholders  to fix certain terms and issue shares of our preferred stock  par value per share 
actions of our board of directors pursuant to this authority may have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing a change in control of the company 
other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and in our bylaws impose procedural and other requirements that could be deemed to have anti takeover effects  including replacing incumbent directors 
in addition  our board of directors is divided into three classes  each of which is to serve for a staggered three year term after the initial classification and election and  incumbent directors may not be removed without cause  all of which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors 
as a delaware corporation we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
with certain exceptions  section imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our voting stock 
our stockholders rights plan could deter takeover attempts 
in we adopted a stockholders rights plan pursuant to which rights attached to each share of our then outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock 
the rights generally are exercisable only if a person or group acquires or more of the voting power as represented by our class a and class b common stock 
under certain conditions  the rights entitle the holders to receive shares of our class a common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right 
our stockholders rights plan could impede the completion of a merger  tender offer  or other takeover attempt even though some or a majority of our stockholders might believe that a merger  tender offer or takeover is in their best interests and even if such transactions could result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares of our stock over the then current market price of our stock 
the terms of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations 
there are no assurances we will be able to raise additional capital 
we have entered into a loan agreement for a million  expandable to million  day revolving line of credit facility with various lenders 
at december   there was million outstanding under this line of credit 
the terms and conditions of the revolving credit facility impose restrictions that affect  among other things  our ability to incur debt  make capital expenditures  merge  sell assets  make distributions  or create or incur liens 
availability of our credit facility is also subject to certain financial covenants 
our ability to comply with the covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will achieve operating results that comply with the provisions of the credit agreement 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility 
in the event of a default  the banks could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of our credit facility  all interest thereon and all other amounts payable under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable 
our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic  financial and business conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we anticipate that borrowings from our existing revolving credit facility  or the refinancing of our revolving credit facility  and cash provided by operating activities  will provide sufficient funds to finance anticipated development plans  meet our operating expenses and service our debt requirements as they become due 
however  in the event that we require additional capital  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
also  there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our current credit facility upon its maturity or on favorable terms 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
systems failure may disrupt our business 
our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems  including our mutual fund transfer agency system maintained by a third party service provider 
we are highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and also on the proper functioning of computer systems of third parties 
we rely heavily on financial  accounting and other data processing systems 
if any of these do not function properly  we could suffer financial loss  business disruption  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation 
if our systems are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions  our ability to expand could be affected 
although we have back up systems in place  we cannot be sure that any systems failure or interruption  whether caused by a fire  other natural disaster  power or telecommunications failure  act of war or otherwise will not occur  or that back up procedures and capabilities in the event of any failure or interruption will be adequate 
there may be an adverse effect on the value of our class a common stock due to the disparate voting rights of our class a common stock and our class b common stock 
the holders of our class a common stock and our class b common stock have identical rights except that holders of our class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share while holders of our class b common stock are entitled to five votes per share on all matters to be voted on by our stockholders and holders of our class a common stock are not eligible to vote on any alteration of the powers  preferences  or special rights of our class b common stock that would not adversely affect our class a common stock and vice versa 
for example  holders of our class a common stock would not be entitled to vote on proposals to decrease the voting power of the class b common stock  to decrease the right of class b common stock to receive dividends  or to diminish the rights of the our class b common stock in liquidation  and vice versa 
the differential in the voting rights could adversely affect the value of the class a common stock to the extent that investors or any potential future purchaser of the company views the superior voting rights of the class b common stock to have value 
the existence of two separate classes of common stock could result in less liquidity for either class of common stock than if we had only one class of common stock 
we may have difficulty executing our acquisition strategy 
we have adopted a strategy to selectively pursue acquisitions and alliances that will add new products or alternative distribution systems 
there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices  have sufficient capital resources to realize our acquisition strategy or be successful in entering into definitive agreements for desired acquisitions 
in addition  we have limited experience in finding  acquiring and integrating other companies and we may not be successful in the integration of acquired companies 
an acquisition may not prove to add new products or distribution systems or otherwise be advantageous to us 
we may not be able to sell and lease back our home office properties 
in connection with our decision to sell certain of our investments in real estate  we are attempting to sell and lease back our home office properties 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to sell and lease back our home office properties on acceptable terms or be successful in entering into definitive agreements for such a sale and lease back 
the restructuring of our mutual fund products to enhance our competitiveness and distribution channels may not be successful 
in october  we restructured our mutual fund products by offering additional classes of mutual fund shares and closing non industry standard classes in an effort to enhance our competitiveness and strategic distribution alternatives and favorably impact our distribution margin 
we anticipate that the product restructuring will result in our product line being more consistent with the industry  providing our clients with more choices and greater value and accommodating additional changes for strategic distribution flexibility 
there can be no assurances that the restructuring of our mutual fund products will enhance our competitiveness and distribution channels or that it will favorably impact our distribution margin 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
the company s cash equivalents and short term investments and its outstanding debt bear variable interest rates 
the company has not used derivative instruments to offset the exposure to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
as noted in item  the company s revenues and net income are based in part on the value of the investment portfolios managed 
accordingly  financial market declines will negatively impact the company s assets under management and  in turn  its revenues and profitability
