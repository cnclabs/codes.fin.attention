item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth plans and projected revenues  operating profits  earnings and costs  information included or incorporated by reference in our future filings with the securities and exchange commission including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth plans and projected revenues  operating profits  earnings and costs  and information contained in written material  releases and oral statements issued by  or on behalf of  school specialty including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth plans and projected revenues  operating profits  earnings and costs 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements identified above 
factors which may cause such a difference to occur include  but are not limited to  the following potential liabilities related to spin offs 
we became a public company in june when us office products distributed all of our shares and the shares of three other companies to its shareholders and we sold additional shares of our stock in a public offering 
in connection with these distributions known as the spin offs  we and the other three companies whose shares were distributed each agreed with us office products that if any of us took any action or failed to act in a way that materially caused the distributions to be taxable  then us office products could require any of us to pay to it the full amount of the tax losses it suffered as a result of the distributions 
we and the three other spin off companies also agreed that if the distributions became taxable for any other reason  we would each pay to us office products a portion of its tax losses based on the relative aggregate value of each company s common stock immediately after the distributions 
we also agreed with the other three spin off companies that if one or more of us materially caused the distributions to be taxable and any of the other companies were required to pay tax losses under the agreement to us office products  then the company or companies that materially caused the distributions to be taxable would reimburse the other companies for such payments 
in addition  we and the other three spin off companies each agreed with us office products to pay a portion of the securities law and general liabilities of us office products arising prior to the distributions and  if any of the spin off companies fails to pay its portion  to pay a portion of the unpaid amount 
the maximum aggregate amount we can be required to pay for all shared liabilities is limited by the agreement to million including as a result of defaults by the other spin off companies 
us office products has been named as a defendant in various class action lawsuits relating to the distributions that allege  among other things  violations of the federal securities laws 
material amount of goodwill 
approximately million  or  of our total assets as of april  represents intangible assets  the significant majority of which is goodwill 
goodwill is the amount by which the costs of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire 
we are required to record goodwill as an intangible asset on our balance sheet and to amortize it over a period of years 
we generally amortize goodwill for each acquisition on a straight line method over a period of years 
even though it reduces our net income for accounting purposes  amortization of goodwill may not be deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  we are required to periodically evaluate whether we can recover our remaining goodwill from the undiscounted future cash flows that we expect to receive from the operations of the acquired companies 
if these undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the associated goodwill  the goodwill is impaired and we must reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to equal the discounted future cash flows and take the amount of the reduction as a charge against our income 
reductions in our net income caused by the amortization or write down of goodwill could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
dependence on growth of student population and school expenditures 
our growth strategy and profitability also depend on growth in the student population and expenditures per student in public and private elementary and secondary schools 
the level of student enrollment is largely a function of demographics  while expenditures per student are also affected by government budgets and the prevailing political and social attitudes towards education 
any significant and sustained decline in student enrollment and or expenditures per student could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
seasonality of our business 
our educational supply businesses are highly seasonal 
because most of our customers want their school supplies delivered before or shortly after the commencement of the school year  we make most of our sales from may to october 
as a result  we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first six months of our fiscal year and operate at a loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
this seasonality causes our operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter 
dependence on key suppliers and service providers 
we depend upon a limited number of suppliers for some of our products  especially furniture 
we also depend upon a limited number of service providers for the delivery of our products 
if these suppliers or service providers are unable to provide the products or services that we require or materially increase their costs especially during our peak season of june through september  this could impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely and profitable basis and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as we seek to reduce the number of our suppliers and to minimize duplicative lines as part of our business strategy  we are likely to increase our dependence on remaining vendors 
reliance on key personnel 
our business depends to a large extent on the abilities and continued efforts of current executive officers and senior management  including daniel p 
spalding  our chief executive officer 
we are also likely to depend heavily on the executive officers and senior management of businesses that we acquire in the future 
if any of these people become unable or unwilling to continue in his or her present role  or if we are unable to attract and retain other qualified employees  our business could be adversely affected 
although we have employment contracts with most executive officers  we do not have employment agreements with our senior management 
we do not have and do not intend to obtain key man life insurance covering any of our executive officers or other members of senior management 
competition 
the market for school supplies is highly competitive and fragmented 
we estimate that over  companies market educational materials to schools for pre kindergarten through twelfth grade as a primary focus of their business 
we also face increasing competition from alternate channel marketers  including superstores and office product contract stationers  that have not traditionally focused on marketing school supplies 
these competitors are likely to continue to expand their product lines and interest in school supplies 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources and buying power than we do 
we believe that the educational supplies market will consolidate over the next several years  which is likely to increase competition in our markets and in our search for attractive acquisition candidates 
dependence on our systems 
we believe that one of our competitive advantages is our information systems  including our proprietary pc based customer order management system  junebox off line 
we have integrated the operations of almost all of our divisions and subsidiaries and their information systems are linked to host systems located at our headquarters in appleton  wisconsin and at two other locations 
if any of these links disrupted or become unavailable  this could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
several of our recently acquired divisions and or subsidiaries as well as gresswell our uk subsidiary use predecessor information systems 
with the exception of gresswell  we intend to convert the information systems of these businesses to one of our host systems as soon as practicable 
however  none of these businesses has a backup computer system or backup extra communication lines 
even though we have taken precautions to protect ourselves from events that could interrupt the operations of these businesses and intend to do so for other businesses we acquire in the future  we cannot be sure that a fire  flood or other natural disaster affecting their systems would not disable the system or prevent the system from communicating with our other businesses 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
absence of dividends 
we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
in addition  our ability to pay dividends may be restricted from time to time by the financial covenants contained in our credit agreements and debt instruments 
our current credit facility contains restrictions on  and in some circumstances may prevent  our payment of dividends 
leverage 
as of april   we had million of bank debt outstanding 
in addition  our leverage could increase over time 
our credit facility permits us to incur additional debt under certain circumstances and we expect to borrow under our credit facility for general corporate purposes  including working capital and for acquisitions 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends on our future performance 
our future performance is influenced by general economic conditions and by financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to service our debt  we may have to delay our acquisition program  sell our equity securities  sell our assets  or restructure and refinance our debt 
we cannot give our stockholders any assurance that  if we are unable to service our debt  it is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company 
item properties our corporate headquarters are located in an owned facility at north bluemound drive  appleton  wisconsin  a combined office and warehouse facility of approximately  square feet 
we lease or own the following principal facilities approximate square owned locations footage leased lease expiration agawam  massachusetts  owned atlanta  georgia  leased january  birmingham  alabama  leased november  bowling green  kentucky  leased june  fremont  nebraska  leased june  fresno  california  leased november  hoddesdon  england  leased september  lancaster  pennsylvania  leased december  lancaster  pennsylvania  leased february  lufkin  texas  owned mansfield  ohio  owned new berlin  wisconsin  leased march  salina  kansas  owned the  square foot lancaster  pennsylvania facility is used for manufacturing and the fremont  nebraska facility is used for production of school forms 
we believe that our properties  as enhanced for our ongoing expansion  are adequate to support our operations for the foreseeable future 
we regularly review the utilization and consolidation of our facilities 
item legal proceedings we are  from time to time  a party to legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
our management believes that none of these legal proceedings will materially or adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders there were no matters submitted during the quarter ended april  to a vote of our security holders

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are the largest marketer of non textbook educational supplies and furniture to schools for pre kindergarten through twelfth grade 
we offer more than  items through an innovative two pronged marketing approach that targets both school administrators and individual teachers 
our broad product range enables us to provide our customers with one source for virtually all of their non textbook school supplies and furniture needs 
we have grown significantly in recent years both through internal growth and acquisitions 
revenues have increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is driven primarily by internal growth and acquisitions 
our revenues for fiscal were million and our operating income before restructuring costs was million  which represented compound annual increases of and  respectively  compared to our historical results for fiscal our gross margin has improved in recent years primarily due to acquisitions and increased buying power 
we have acquired many specialty businesses  which tend to have higher gross margins than our traditional business 
in addition  our acquisitions of both specialty and traditional businesses have increased our buying power  resulting in reduced costs of the products we purchase 
our operating margins have also improved significantly over the last several years 
this improvement reflects our recent acquisitions of specialty companies which typically have higher operating margins than our traditional businesses 
in addition  through the integration of acquired businesses  we have been able to further improve our operating margins by eliminating redundant expenses  leveraging overhead costs and improving purchasing power 
while we have already achieved significant operating margin improvements from the acquisitions we have made to date  we believe there are still opportunities to eliminate redundant expenses 
our effective tax rate is higher than the federal statutory tax rate of  due primarily to non deductible goodwill amortization and state taxes 
our business and working capital needs are highly seasonal with peak sales levels occurring from may through october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of our orders so that schools and teachers receive their merchandise by the start of each school year 
our inventory levels increase in may through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
the majority of shipments are made between may and october and the majority of cash receipts are collected from september through december 
as a result  we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first six months of our fiscal year and operate at a loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain information as a percentage of revenues on a historical basis concerning our results of operations for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal fiscal year ended april  april  april  weeks weeks weeks revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring and strategic restructuring acquisition costs operating income interest expense  net other expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income consolidated historical results of operations year ended april  weeks compared to year ended april  weeks revenues revenues increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this increase is primarily due to internal growth on existing business and the inclusion of revenues from the six companies acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting since the beginning of fiscal gross profit gross profit increased from million  or of revenues  in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to a shift in product mix to increased revenue from the specialty business  where proprietary products generate higher gross margins than the traditional business  an improvement in traditional business gross margins  driven primarily by more favorable pricing and the elimination of less profitable products from our product offering  and an improvement in specialty business gross margin  which was driven by more favorable product mix and contributions from sportime  which was acquired in february of fiscal  and has higher gross margins than most of our other businesses 
these increases were slightly offset by contributions from the internet business  which as a group has lower gross margins than our other businesses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include selling expenses the most significant component of which is sales wages and commissions  operations expenses which includes customer service  warehouse and outbound transportation costs  catalog costs  general administrative overhead which includes information systems  accounting  legal  and human resources and depreciation and amortization expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million  or of revenues  in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily due to an increase in revenue 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of revenue is primarily due to a shift in revenue mix to the specialty business  which has higher selling  general and administrative expenses than the traditional business  higher amortization expense due to goodwill amortization related to the six acquisitions we have completed since the beginning of fiscal  and expenses related to expanding the internet business  which are incremental in fiscal these increases are offset by reduced selling  general and administrative expenses in the traditional business  which is primarily due to the integration of beckley cardy and the restructuring of the traditional business  which began in the second quarter of fiscal restructuring costs during fiscal  we recorded a strategic restructuring charge of million in the first quarter and million in the second quarter  for a total of million during fiscal the million charge related to a one time  non cash charge for compensation expense attributed to us office product s stock option tender offer and the sale of shares of common stock to some of our executive management personnel 
the million charge was to consolidate existing warehousing  customer service and sales operations 
further details of the restructuring charge are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net interest expense and other expenses net interest expense increased million from million  or of revenues  in fiscal  to million  or of revenues in fiscal the increase in net interest expense is primarily attributed to the debt assumed and cash paid for the six companies acquired since the beginning of fiscal  partially offset by debt repaid from the net proceeds from our secondary offering in april other expenses of million for fiscal primarily represents the loss on the disposal of a facility donated to a municipality and a non cash impairment charge on a minority investment 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for fiscal increased or million over fiscal  reflecting income tax rates of and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a decline in the effective state tax rate and a reduction in the amount of non deductible goodwill amortization 
the higher effective tax rate  as compared to the federal statutory rate of  is primarily due to state income taxes and non deductible goodwill amortization 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenues consolidated revenues increased  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to the inclusion of revenues of thirteen businesses acquired since the beginning of fiscal l and internal growth on existing businesses 
gross profit gross profit increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to the acquisitions referred to above 
gross profit as a percent of revenues declined slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal this decline was due primarily to a reduction in traditional business gross margin  driven by the acquisition of beckley cardy  which had lower gross margins than our existing traditional business and an increase in lower margin bid revenues 
these reductions were offset by an increase in specialty business revenue  which typically has higher gross margins than the traditional business 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due primarily to the acquisitions referred to above 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses declined from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was the result of cost savings attributable to the integration of companies acquired during fiscal and the consolidation of our warehousing  sales and customer service operations under the restructuring of the traditional business which began in the second quarter of fiscal these decreases were offset by increases attributable to the acquisition of beckley cardy in the second quarter of fiscal which had higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues than our existing businesses and higher depreciation and amortization expenses due to the thirteen companies acquired since the beginning of fiscal restructuring costs during fiscal  we recorded a strategic restructuring charge of million in the first quarter and million in the second quarter  for a total of million during fiscal the million charge related to a one time  non cash charge for compensation expense attributed to us office product s stock option tender offer and the sale of shares of common stock to some of our executive management personnel  net of underwriting discounts

further details of the restructuring charge are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net interest expense net interest expense increased  from million  or of revenues  for fiscal to million  or of revenues  for fiscal the increase in net interest expense is primarily attributed to the debt assumed and cash paid for the thirteen companies acquired since the beginning of fiscal  offset by debt repaid from the proceeds from our secondary public offering in april  our initial public offering in june  and the forgiveness of debt from us office products in connection with the spin off 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  reflecting effective income tax rates of and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively

the agreement fixes the day libor interest rate at per annum floating libor on april  was on the million notional amount and has a three year term that may be canceled by the bank of new york on the second anniversary 
as of april   the effective interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility was approximately excluding the effect of the swap agreement and including the effect of the swap agreement 
in fiscal  we borrowed under the credit facility primarily for seasonal working capital and capital expenditures 
during fiscal  we made certain immaterial changes to certain financial and other covenants under our credit facility 
on april   we sold  shares of common stock in a public offering for million in net proceeds

in connection with the offerings  we incurred approximately million of expenses 
the total net proceeds to us from the offerings were million 
the net proceeds were used to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
this net cash provided by operating activities during the period is indicative of the high seasonal nature of the business  with sales occurring in the first and second quarter of the fiscal year and cash receipts in the second and third quarters 
net cash used in investing activities was million  including million for acquisitions  million for additions to property and equipment and million for other long term assets 
investments in other long term assets include million for a minority interest in a better way of learning which is an e commerce fulfillment partner of school specialty  million for software licensing to power junebox

net cash provided by financing activities was million  including million provided by us office products to fund the cash portion of the purchase price and the repayment of debt assumed with the acquisition of the fiscal purchased companies  million of which was considered a contribution of capital by us office products  partially offset by million used to repay indebtedness 
our anticipated capital expenditures for the next twelve months are expected to be million 
the largest items include software development for our internet initiative  computer hardware and software and warehouse equipment 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and borrowings available from our existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for operations  including capital expenditures  and our debt service obligations 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations our business is subject to seasonal influences 
our historical revenues and profitability have been dramatically higher in the first two quarters of our fiscal year may october primarily due to increased shipments to customers coinciding with the start of each school year 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in our costs for the products sold  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies we acquire may differ substantially from our own  which could contribute to further fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year

to manage interest rate risk on the variable rate borrowings under the revolving portion of our credit facility  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement during fiscal see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
this interest rate swap agreement has the effect of locking in  for a specified period  the base interest rate we will pay on the million notional principal amount established in the swap 
as a result  while this hedging arrangement is structured to reduce our exposure to interest rate increases  it also limits the benefit we might otherwise have received from any interest rate decreases 
this swap is usually cash settled monthly  with interest expense adjusted for amounts paid or received 
effects of this swap have been minor for the year ending april
