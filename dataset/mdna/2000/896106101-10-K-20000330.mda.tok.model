item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our business strategy for the past several years has been to pursue opportunities to acquire vessel fleets and diversify into international markets 
since our initial public offering in may  we significantly expanded our international operations by acquiring saevik supply  a then publicly traded norwegian company  for approximately million in cash  which we subsequently renamed trico supply asa 
we also acquired supply boats in the gulf at an aggregate cost of million 
we have also constructed six new vessels  and have upgraded and refurbished the majority of our gulf supply boat fleet 
our newly built vessels are specially designed vessels to increase our presence in certain international and deepwater markets 
as a result of this growth  trico is now the second largest owner and operator of supply boats in the gulf and a leading operator in the north sea 
our results of operations are affected primarily by day rates and fleet utilization 
demand for our vessels is primarily impacted by the level of offshore oil and gas drilling activity  which can be influenced by a number of factors  including oil and gas prices and drilling budgets of exploration and production companies  and  to a lesser extent  the market for the maintenance  repair and salvage of existing platforms 
as a result  trends in oil and gas prices may significantly affect our vessel utilization and day rates 
our day rates and utilization rates are also affected by the size  configuration and capabilities of our fleet 
in the case of supply boats  psvs and ahtss  the deck space and liquid mud and dry bulk cement capacity are important attributes 
in certain markets and for certain customers  horsepower and dynamic positioning systems are also important requirements 
for crew boats  size and speed are important factors  and in the case of lift boats  longer leg length and greater crane capacity add versatility and marketability 
our day rates and utilization can also be affected by the supply of other vessels available in a given market with similar configuration and capabilities 
our operating costs primarily are a function of fleet size and utilization levels 
the most significant direct operating costs are wages paid to vessel crews  maintenance and repairs and marine insurance 
generally  increases or decreases in vessel utilization only affect that portion of our direct operating costs that is incurred when the vessels are active 
as a result  direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues may vary substantially due to changes in day rates and utilization 
in addition to these variable costs  we incur fixed charges related to the depreciation of our fleet and costs for the routine dry dock inspection  maintenance and repair designed to ensure compliance with us coast guard regulations and to maintain required certifications for our vessels 
maintenance and repair expense and marine inspection amortization charges are generally determined by the aggregate number of dry dockings and other repairs undertaken in a given period 
costs incurred for dry dock inspection and regulatory compliance are capitalized and amortized over the period between such dry dockings  typically three to five years 
results of operations the table below sets forth by vessel class  the average day rates and utilization for our vessels and the average number of vessels we owned during the periods indicated

comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  our revenues for were million  a decrease of  compared to million in revenues for this decrease in revenues was due to the decrease in average day rates and utilization for our vessel fleet 
the decrease in day rates and utilization is the result of the reduction in worldwide oil and gas exploration and development activity due to the low oil prices which existed in and part of day rates and utilization for our gulf supply boats and north sea psvs were also impacted by newly built vessels entering the market which increased our competition 
oil and gas prices have since increased to favorable levels  which our management believes  if sustained  should lead to increased drilling activity offshore and increased demand for marine support vessels 
late in the third quarter of  we began to experience improvement in utilization and modest increases in day rates for our gulf fleet 
however  the north sea  which was slower to decline in than the gulf  had not experienced any such improvement as of year end our average supply boat day rates in the gulf decreased to  for  compared to  for  average lift boat day rates decreased to  compared to  for  and average day rates for our fleet of crew boats and line handling vessels decreased to  compared to  during utilization for our gulf supply boat fleet in was also impacted by the de activation or stacking of supply boats 
vessel downtime for dry docking and refurbishment also impacted our supply boat utilization rates for both the and periods 
utilization for our gulf supply boat fleet decreased to in from in utilization for the lift boats was during  compared to for the previous year 
utilization for the crew boats and line handling vessels decreased to in  compared to in average day rates for our north sea vessels in  decreased to  compared to  for vessel utilization was for  compared to for as a result of low market day rates and utilization  we elected to de activate two of our north sea psvs in the third quarter of a third psv was de activated in the fourth quarter of during  direct vessel operating expenses decreased to million of revenues  compared to million of revenues for direct vessel operating expenses decreased in compared to due to cost reduction measures that we implemented and the de activation of supply vessels in the gulf and three psvs in the north sea 
the decrease in direct vessel operating expenses was partially offset by additional expenses associated with four new vessels that were placed into service in the last quarter of and the first half of direct vessel operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased due primarily to the decrease in utilization and average vessel day rates for our vessel fleet 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for  up from million for  due to our expanded vessel fleet in the gulf  the north sea and brazil 
amortization of marine inspection costs increased to million for  from million in this was primarily due to the amortization of increased dry docking and marine inspection costs which we incurred in and due to our gulf supply boat upgrade and refurbishment program 
our general and administrative expenses decreased to million of revenues in  from million of revenues for  due to cost reduction measures we implemented 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased in due to the decrease in utilization and average day rates for our vessel fleet in interest expense increased to million during compared to million for this increase was due to higher average interest rates  increased borrowings in which were used to fund our vessel construction and vessel upgrade projects and our working capital requirements 
also  in we capitalized million of interest because of our various vessel construction projects compared to million of interest capitalized in in  we had income tax benefit of million  compared to income tax expense of million in our effective income tax rate for was 
the variance from our statutory rate is due to income contributed by trico supply  which is deferred at the norwegian statutory rate of  as it is our intent to reinvest the unremitted earnings and postpone their repatriation indefinitely 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues for were million  an increase of  compared to million in revenues for this increase was primarily due to the addition  for a full year  of north sea operations which we acquired in december the increase in revenues from our north sea operations was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from the gulf of mexico  principally due to the decrease in average day rates and utilization for our supply boats 
this decrease in supply boat day rates and utilization is the result of the reduction in industry activity in the gulf due to low oil prices 
day rates and utilization for our supply boats was also impacted by the market entry of newly constructed vessels which have added to the increased competitive environment 
average supply boat day rates in the gulf decreased to  for  compared to  for  average lift boat day rates increased to  compared to  for  and average day rates for our crew boats and line handling vessels increased to  compared to  during utilization rates for our gulf supply boats was also impacted by the significant vessel downtime due to our extensive vessel upgrade and refurbishment program 
utilization for our gulf supply boat fleet decreased to in from in utilization for the lift boats was during  compared to for the year ago period 
utilization for our crew boats and line handling vessels decreased to in  compared to in during  our direct vessel operating expenses increased to million of revenues  compared to million of revenues for  due to the addition of the north sea fleet and the consolidation of our brazilian subsidiary beginning july  our direct vessel operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenues due to the decrease in average vessel day rates during in the gulf 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for  up from million for  due to the acquisition of the north sea vessels in december  and our expanded vessel fleet both in the gulf of mexico and brazil 
amortization of marine inspection costs increased to million for  from million in  due to the amortization of increased dry docking and marine inspection costs associated with our fleet upgrade and refurbishment program  primarily for our gulf supply boats 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues in  from million of revenues for  due to the addition of the north sea operations and the consolidation of our brazilian subsidiary beginning july  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased in due to the decrease in average supply boat day rates in the gulf of mexico 
interest expense increased to million during compared to million for this increase was due to our increased debt in associated with the acquisition of the north sea fleet on december  and increased borrowings which we used to fund various vessel construction and vessel upgrade and refurbishment projects 
in july  we issued million principal amount of senior notes due the notes  the proceeds of which were used to purchase supply boats in the gulf and to repay outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility 
in november and december  we issued an additional million principal amount of the notes  the proceeds of which were used to fund the acquisition of our north sea operations 
in  we had income tax expense of million  compared to income tax expense of million in liquidity and capital resources our ongoing capital requirements arise primarily from our need to service debt  fund working capital  acquire  maintain or improve equipment and make other investments 
our business strategy for the past several years had been to enhance our position as a leading supplier of marine support services by pursuing opportunities to acquire vessel fleets and by diversifying into international market areas 
historically  internally generated funds and equity and debt financing had provided funding for these activities 
however  due to the reduction in industry activity and the resulting decreases in day rates and utilization rates experienced in  we experienced a net loss  before extraordinary item  of million during as a result of this loss  our capital requirements were primarily funded through the issuance of additional equity and the incurrence of debt 
our operating loss  current operating levels and amount of debt has limited our financial flexibility 
during  we completed vessel construction and upgrade projects that we committed to prior to the downturn in industry activity 
additionally  during the second quarter of we completed our vessel improvement program that consisted of the extensive upgrade and refurbishment of a significant portion of our gulf supply boat fleet 
while this refurbishment program resulted in significant vessel downtime in and in the first half of  we believe that it has extended the service lives of many of our vessels and will significantly reduce required capital expenditures in the future 
capital expenditures for consisted principally of million for the construction of new vessels and other vessel improvements  and million of us coast guard dry docking and vessel refurbishment costs 
funds during were provided by million in borrowings under our bank credit facility  million in net proceeds from the issuance of common equity in a private placement  million principal amount of year ship financing bonds guaranteed by the united states government  and million generated from operating activities 
during  we repaid million of debt  and made capital expenditures totaling million  which included million of deferred marine inspection costs 
cash on hand decreased by million during we have outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes are unsecured and are required to be guaranteed by all of our significant subsidiaries 
except in certain circumstances  the senior notes may not be prepaid until august   at which time they may be redeemed  at our option  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to plus accrued and unpaid interest  with the redemption price declining ratably on august of each of the succeeding three years 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends or make other distributions  create certain liens  sell assets  or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions 
as a result of our operating results  we can now only incur additional debt of approximately million beyond that presently outstanding 
we maintain a bank credit facility that provides a revolving line of credit that can be used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
on july   we replaced our million revolving line of credit with a million revolving facility 
the bank credit facility is collateralized by a mortgage on substantially all of our vessels other than those located in the north sea and brazil 
amounts borrowed under the bank credit facility mature on july  and bear interest at a eurocurrency rate plus a margin that depends on our leverage ratio 
as of march   we had approximately million of debt outstanding under the bank credit facility and the weighted average interest rate for the bank credit facility was 
the bank credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make capital expenditures  pay dividends or make certain other distributions  create certain liens  sell assets or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions 
due to our operating results  the financial covenants contained in the bank credit facility have been amended twice since the facility was put in place in july although the bank credit facility does impose some limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us  it expressly permits distributions to us by our significant subsidiaries for scheduled principal and interest payments on the senior notes 
in june  we refinanced our norwegian bank credit facilities with a revolving credit facility in the amount of nok million million 
the commitment amount for this norwegian bank facility reduces by nok million million every six months beginning december  with the balance of the commitment to expire in june in december  we amended the norwegian bank facility to postpone the scheduled december nok million reduction of the commitment amount until june as of march   the commitment amount for the norwegian bank facility was nok million million  and we had approximately nok million million of debt outstanding under the facility 
the weighted average interest rate for the norwegian bank facility was as of march  the norwegian bank facility is collateralized by a security interest in certain of our north sea vessels  requires trico supply to maintain certain financial ratios and limits the ability of trico supply to create liens  or merge or consolidate with other entities 
amounts borrowed under the norwegian bank facility bear interest at nibor norwegian interbank offered rate plus a margin 
as a result the reduction in industry activity and resulting decrease in day rates and utilization rates  and the completion  during  of significant capital expenditures relating to vessel construction and upgrade projects  capital expenditures for will be limited to regulatory mandated vessel dry docking costs 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with available borrowings under our bank credit facility and additional borrowings permitted under the indenture governing the senior notes  will be sufficient to fund our currently planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
while we position ourselves for industry conditions to improve  we also intend to position ourselves to pursue any acquisition opportunities that we believe may be presented in our selected market areas 
in order to improve our financial flexibility  during we expect to take steps to raise additional equity  subject to market conditions 
we are also considering the disposition of certain non core assets to reduce financial leverage and increase liquidity 
however  we can give no assurances regarding the availability or terms of any of the possible transactions under consideration  and we could be adversely affected if we are unable to consummate such transactions or if the terms are not favorable to us 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact sfas no 
will have on our financial statements  if any 
we are also reviewing sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements and do not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect  if any  on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures primarily include interest rate and exchange rate fluctuation on derivative and financial instruments as detailed below 
our market risk sensitive instruments are classified as other than trading 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with our financial activities during trico s exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents estimates of possible changes in fair values  future earnings or cash flows that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and the timing of transactions 
interest rate sensitivity we have entered into a number of variable and fixed rate debt obligations  denominated in both the us dollar and the norwegian kroner norwegian debt payable in norwegian kroner  as detailed in note in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
these instruments are subject to interest rate risk 
we manage this risk by monitoring our ratio of fixed and variable rate debt obligations in view of changing market conditions and from time to time altering that ratio by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate bank credit facilities with fixed rate debt or by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
as of december  and  we had million nok million and million nok million  respectively  in variable rate  norwegian kroner denominated debt 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to manage our interest rate exposure on this debt 
the agreements require that we pay a fixed rate of interest on a notional amount of principal to a counterparty 
the counterparty  in turn  pays us a variable rate of interest on the same notional amount of principal 
the effect of the swaps is to limit the interest rate exposure to a fixed percentage on the related debt obligation 
as of december   the carrying value of our long term fixed rate debt  including accrued interest  was million  which included our senior notes million  marad bonds million  marad bonds million and the norwegian fixed rate debt million 
as of december   the carrying value of our long term fixed rate debt  including accrued interest  was million 
the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt as of december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined using discounted future cash flows based on quoted market prices  where available  on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of the balance sheet dates 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rates would decrease the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt as of december  and by approximately million and million  respectively 
the hypothetical fair values are based on the same assumptions utilized in computing fair values 
as of december  and  the carrying value of our long term variable rate debt  including accrued interest  was approximately million and million  respectively  which included the bank credit facility and trico supply s facility 
the fair value of this debt approximates the carrying value because the interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates 
fair value was determined as noted above 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rates as of december  and would increase annual interest expense by approximately  and million  respectively 
our interest rate swap agreements had fair values  as of december  and  of  and  respectively  based on the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting dates 
as of december  and  a hypothetical increase in the pay rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately  and  respectively 
a hypothetical increase in the receive rates would decrease interest expense by corresponding amounts 
in february  we sold certain of these interest rate swap agreements for approximately foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity our foreign subsidiaries collect revenues and pay expenses in several different foreign currencies 
we monitor the exchange rate of our foreign currencies and  when deemed appropriate  enter into hedging transactions in order to mitigate the risk from foreign currency fluctuations 
we also manage foreign currency risk by attempting to contract as much foreign revenue as possible in us dollars 
we have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulting from some of our vessels operating in the united kingdom under contracts denominated in the great britain pound gbp 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of firmly committed sales contracts through the following year end denominated in the gbp 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable exchange rate as of december  and would result in increases in future cash flows of approximately  and  respectively 
a decrease would result in corresponding decreases in future cash flows 
as of december  we had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts  as management believed the relationship between the norwegian kroner and the gbp did not present sufficient risk to warrant any hedging transactions 
we closely monitor the movement in foreign exchange rates and will enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts if we believe our foreign currency risk significantly increases
