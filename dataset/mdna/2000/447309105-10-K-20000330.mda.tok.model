item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations throughout the following discussion  the business operated by huntway refining company is referred to as huntway and all per share data is diluted per share data 
on june   huntway merged the partnership  huntway partners lp  into a newly formed corporation  huntway refining company  effectively converting the business to corporate status 
the following should be read in conjunction with the foregoing selected financial data and the historical financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report

results of operations huntway is principally engaged in the processing and sale of liquid asphalt products  as well as the production of other refined petroleum products such as gas oil  naphtha  kerosene distillate and bunker fuel 
huntways ability to generate income depends principally upon the margins between the prices for its refined petroleum products and the cost of crude oil  as well as upon demand for liquid asphalt  which affects both price and sales volume 
historically  refined petroleum product prices including prices for liquid asphalt  although to a lesser degree than for huntways other refined petroleum products generally fluctuate with crude oil price levels 
there has not been a relationship between total revenues and income due to the volatile commodity character of crude oil prices 
as a result  management believes that increases or decreases in revenues is not a meaningful basis for comparing historical results of operations 
compared to in  huntway reported net income of  
per diluted share versus pro forma net income of  
per diluted share in after an additional pro forma provision for income taxes 
recorded net income in was  
per diluted share 
earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization and income taxes increased to  in versus  in pre tax income increased in to  from  in primarily due to lower incentive plan accruals 
the overall provision for income taxes was flat between periods despite the increased level of pre tax income in as a result of tax credits associated with increased capital expenditures 
the following table sets forth the effects of changes in price and volume on sales and materials primarily crude oil and processing costs for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  material net barrels sales processing margin sold year ended december  effect of changes in price    effect of changes in volume     year ended december  revenues increased to  in from  in while total barrels sold increased to  barrels in from  barrels in the increase in revenues between periods of  or was primarily caused by higher average product prices  which moved upwards with sharply higher crude oil costs 
average per barrel product selling prices increased from in to in  an increase of or 
sales volume increased by  barrels or between periods and was also a significant contributor to the revenue increase 
average per barrel product prices did not increase to the same degree as the increase in average per barrel crude oil prices primarily because asphalt selling prices tend to lag crude price movements 
the increase in sales volume can be attributed to increased demand supplied by additional production from our benicia refinery due to the modernization project as well as purchased asphalt 
asphalt pricing tends to be less volatile than both crude oil or gasoline and diesel prices  which are more readily transported and reflect the impact of a large and active commodity market 
as a result  asphalt pricing and margins tend to lag behind crude oil price changes either up or down 
accordingly  despite stronger asphalt demand due to improved public and private construction activity in california in as well as increased sales of higher margin specialty asphalt products  our average asphalt selling prices increased only between years despite the increase in our average per barrel crude oil costs before the impact of hedging activities 
in contrast  light product prices increased by between periods  reflecting their common commodity nature with crude oil 
this increase  however  also did not exceed the percentage increase of crude oil due to excess refining capacity relative to the demand for fuels and heating oil  which resulted in high diesel and gasoline inventories in huntways market areas through much of and especially in the third and fourth quarters which experienced the bulk of the crude oil price increase for the year 
none the less  light product margins increased in the period as the increase in light product prices of per barrel exceeded the increase in average per barrel crude oil costs 
huntways average per barrel crude oil costs increased in and would have increased absent the impact of hedging activities 
huntways higher per barrel crude oil costs reflect higher average california crude oil posted prices in versus partially offset by huntways mix of crude oil and its crude hedging activities 
california average crude oil postings increased between years as a result of higher world crude oil prices 
management believes these prices increased in response to increased world demand for crude oil due to improving national economies particularly in asia and a decrease in supply due to deliberately lower production by certain oil producing nations 
as a result  in contrast to  world crude oil inventories decreased in and the perception that the demand for crude oil will continue to exceed supply in the near future caused world oil prices to soar in the price of west texas intermediate wti increased by approximately during with continuing sharp increases through mid march processing costs generally include production wages and benefits  utility costs  repairs and maintenance  insurance  property taxes and environmental compliance costs as well as depreciation and amortization 
such costs increased between and on an aggregate basis by and on a per barrel basis by primarily due to higher planned repair and maintenance costs associated with tank refurbishment and inspection 
in addition  the increase also reflects higher labor and benefits expense due to normal cost of living increases and higher head count 
higher heating costs due to increased natural gas prices also contributed to the increase 
in summary  net margins increased nominally by  to  in from  in this was entirely due to the increase in volume as net margin on a per barrel basis fell from to between periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined  or between periods due to reduced incentive plan accruals partially offset by higher costs for salaries and wages  investor relations  professional services and promotional costs  including trade organizations 
the reduction in incentive plan accruals reflects changes made to the accrual formulas to take into account the expected improvement in results from the expansion and modernization of the benicia refinery 
salaries and wages increased as a result of normal increases while the increase in investor relations and professional fees reflects operation of huntway as a corporation rather than a partnership 
net interest expense was flat between years  increasing by a nominal  depreciation and amortization increased by  between periods due to increased levels of capital expenditures  primarily associated with the expansion and modernization of the benicia refinery 
compared to in  huntway reported pro forma net income of  
per diluted share versus pro forma net income of  
per diluted share in after additional pro forma provisions for income taxes of  and  respectively 
recorded net income in of  was net of a  income tax provision as huntway converted to corporate form effective june  no income tax provision was recorded in because huntway was operating as a partnership and accordingly  recorded net income was  
per diluted share 
pre tax income increased to  in from  in this percent improvement in pre tax income of  between years was primarily caused by increased asphalt gross profit as a result of lower crude oil prices and increased demand 
the following table sets forth the effects of changes in price and volume on sales and materials mostly crude and processing costs for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  materials net barrels sales processing margin sold year ended december  effect of changes in price    effect of changes in volume     year ended december  revenues declined to  in from  in while total barrels sold increased slightly to  barrels in from  barrels in the decline in revenues between periods of  or was caused by lower average product prices  which moved down with lower crude oil costs 
average per barrel product selling prices declined from in to in  a decline of or 
average per barrel product prices did not decline to the same degree as the decline in average per barrel crude oil prices due to fairly stable asphalt selling prices between periods  partially offsetting the decline in light end selling prices that declined commensurate with the fall in crude oil costs 
average asphalt selling prices declined only slightly between years despite the decline in average per barrel crude oil costs 
this was caused by stronger asphalt demand due to improved public and private construction activity in california in as well as increased sales of higher margin specialty asphalt products 
the combination of fairly stable asphalt pricing and significantly lower crude oil costs caused asphalt per barrel margins and total asphalt gross profit to increase between years 
light end margins  on the other hand  continued to decline in versus as they had in versus the lack of any major refinery problems in and the impact of less expensive crude oil caused an oversupply of finished gasoline and diesel products in california 
relatively inexpensive crude oil costs caused refiners to run incremental barrels despite lower per barrel refining margins 
the resultant oversupply of these finished fuels reduced prices for huntways unfinished light end products as these products are priced off of finished gasoline and diesel prices 
huntways average per barrel crude oil costs declined in huntways lower per barrel crude oil costs reflect lower average california crude oil posted prices in versus partially offset by huntways mix of crude oil and its crude hedging costs 
california average crude oil postings decreased between years as a result of lower world crude oil prices 
these costs declined in response to reduced world demand for crude oil due to lower asian demand as a result of economic problems in that area of the world and overproduction relative to demand by oil producing nations 
as a result  world oil inventories increased in this fact and the perception that the supply of crude oil would continue to exceed demand in the near future caused world oil prices to collapse in processing costs generally include production wages and benefits  utility costs  repairs and maintenance  insurance  property taxes and environmental compliance costs as well as depreciation and amortization 
such costs increased on an aggregate and on a per barrel basis in this increase reflects higher labor and benefits and higher heating costs due to increased natural gas prices as well as increased repair and maintenance expenditures 
other increases were due to higher environmental compliance costs 
net margin increased in due to the decline in crude oil costs exceeding the decline in average product prices 
this favorable impact on margins reflects improved asphalt margins more than offsetting lower light end margins 
on a per barrel basis  net margin was in versus in selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in the  increase was primarily due to higher incentive plan accruals  higher wage and salary costs  and higher professional fee expenses 
professional fee expenses increased due to costs incurred in converting to corporate form effective june  incentive plan accruals increased due to increased levels of profitability 
wage and salary costs increased due to the addition of a new refinery manager at the benicia refinery and normal wage increases 
net interest expense declined between years by  due to higher levels of interest income 
depreciation and amortization increased  between years due to the accounting for employee stock options issued in january effective with the conversion to corporate form on june   the operations of huntway became subject to corporate federal and state taxes on income and a provision for income taxes of  was provided for the results of operations subsequent to that date 
no such provision was made prior to that date as the taxable income or loss of the partnership was passed on to its partners 
outlook and factors that affect future results a number of uncertainties exist that may affect huntways future operations  including availability and cost of crude oil  pricing of and demand for liquid asphalt and light end products  disruptions in operations as a result of extended periods of inclement weather or natural disaster and increased competition from other refiners 
california refineries including huntways are supplied primarily by onshore and offshore california production and by crude oil transported from alaska with some imports from south america  mexico  the far east and persian gulf 
current production of crude oil in california and alaska totals approximately million bpd 
however  production from existing fields in california and alaska has been gradually declining and competition for it has been increasing 
huntways refineries are located near substantial reserves of heavy  high sulfur crude oil  which is better suited for liquid asphalt production than for gasoline or diesel fuel due to the higher percentage yield of liquid asphalt per barrel 
however  as production rates for this and other crude oils produced in california and alaska declines competition for this crude oil from other refiners is increasing 
as a result of this competition huntway may be required to pay increasingly higher prices to meet its crude oil requirements 
crude oil supply and costs are also impacted by various political and economic events such as under and over production by the major producing nations  war or political uncertainty in the major oil producing regions and regional and national economic recessions and recoveries 
these events could cause crude oil prices to rise to such an extent that huntway may not have sufficient letter of credit availability to purchase all the crude oil it needs to sustain operations to capacity  especially during the summer season 
if this occurred  huntway may be forced to prepay for crude oil or curtail refining operations  either of which could adversely impact results of operations 
to partially mitigate the impact of fluctuations in crude oil prices  huntway has negotiated heavy san joaquin valley crude oil hedge arrangements 
huntways net cost of crude oil increased in as a result of the hedge arrangements due to falling crude oil prices 
the companys net cost of crude oil was reduced in and from what it otherwise would have been as a result of these hedge arrangements 
such hedging acts to smooth out but does not eliminate the ultimate impact of crude oil price swings 
the companys primary product is liquid asphalt 
some of huntways competitors produce liquid asphalt as a by product and are of greater size and have larger financial resources than the company 
in addition  competition in the asphalt market is intense and could increase 
accordingly  the company has in the past  and may in the future  have difficulty raising prices in the face of increasing crude oil costs 
to some of huntways competitors  the margins they receive on asphalt are not as important to their operations as asphalt margins are to huntway 
another potential risk factor concerns the demand for the companys light end products 
these products  which include naphtha  kerosene distillate and gas oil  are manufactured as part of the refining process in conjunction with liquid asphalt 
these light end products are usually sold to larger refiners as feed stocks for their operations and are priced at a discount to wholesale finished gasoline and diesel prices 
if demand for huntways light end products were to decline it would create downward pressure on the companys light end margins or potentially stop operations if light end production could not be sold 
increasing regulatory pressures of an environmental nature could negatively impact the demand for finished fuels in california  which  in turn  would reduce demand for huntways light end products 
while historically the company has had little difficulty in moving its light end production at profitable margins  the potential exists that this demand could be reduced through factors beyond the companys control 
both of huntways california refineries are vulnerable to disruption in operations and reduced operating results due to the possibility of additional earthquakes in california 
for example  the january northridge earthquake destroyed a major pipeline bringing crude oil into southern california and destroyed or severely damaged many bridges  overpasses and freeways in southern california 
the work to repair this damage was substantially completed by early but the road way repairs required primarily concrete and steel and comparatively little liquid asphalt 
future earthquakes could temporarily reduce crude supplies and asphalt demand if substantial damage were sustained by concrete road structures and crude oil pipelines 
demand for liquid paving asphalt products is primarily affected by federal  state and local highway spending  commercial construction and the level of housing starts  all of which are beyond the control of the company 
government highway spending provides a source of demand which has been relatively unaffected by normal business cycles but is dependent upon appropriations 
historically  approximately of huntways liquid asphalt sales have been made to purchasers whose business is directly tied to these various governmental expenditures 
over the long term  the demand for liquid asphalt will also tend to be influenced by changes in population  the level of commercial construction  and housing activity 
federal funding of highway projects is accomplished through the federal aid highway program 
the federal aid highway program is a federally assisted  state administered program that distributes federal funds to the states to construct and improve urban and rural highway systems 
substantially all federal highway funds are derived from gasoline user taxes assessed at the pump 
in addition to federal funding for highway projects  states individually fund transportation improvements with the proceeds of a variety of gasoline and other taxes 
in california  caltrans administers state expenditures for highway projects 
in june the billion federal highway bill  officially known as the transportation equity act for the st century  or tea was enacted 
the bill is estimated to increase transportation related expenditures in california by million a year over a six year period beginning october  as compared to the comparable six year period that began october  this equates to a increase over previous funding levels 
the average california apportionment over the six year period ending in october is estimated to be billion per year or a total of  billion 
of this amount  approximately billion has been designated for interstate maintenance and the national highway system while another billion has been designated for the surface transportation and the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement programs  which concentrate on state and local roadways 
actual and estimated apportionments to california under tea as reported by the federal highway administration are as follows fiscal actual billion fiscal actual billion fiscal actual billion fiscal estimated billion fiscal estimated billion fiscal estimated billion this represents an average apportionment level of approximately billion per year as compared to an average of approximately billion over the fiscal through fiscal period 
the state of california provides additional funding for the construction and maintenance of california roads and highways 
according to the department of finance for the state of california funding available from the state highway account is estimated to average billion per year over the next years excluding the seismic retrofit bond fund 
this compares to an average of billion over the previous ten years 
in november the california electorate passed proposition proposition protects the state transportation fund by requiring that any funds borrowed from the california state transportation fund be repaid with interest within one year except in the case of a fiscal emergency 
in that case funds must be repaid within three years with interest 
such emergencies have been infrequent  occurring only twice in the th century in california 
increased asphalt demand in reflected the impact of both the federal highway bill and california proposition which  the company believes  bodes well for road construction and repair funding in california into the foreseeable future 
demographic studies suggest continued rapid growth in the population of california 
recent studies suggest californias population will increase to approximately million people by up from approximately million today 
this population growth should translate into increased private and public transportation expenditures including road construction and repair 
in recent years a substantial amount of public transportation dollars financed by caltrans were diverted to complete earthquake related bridge retrofit work 
by early the majority of the earthquake bridge retrofit work was completed 
this work was designed to strengthen many of the bridges and overpasses in the state in advance of the next earthquake  the timing of which is unknown 
as expected  caltrans expenditures on road construction and repair did increase in over and versus caltrans is also increasingly specifying higher margin specialized asphalt products in its projects as these products last longer and perform better than conventional paving asphalts 
even if sufficient funding is available at the state and federal level to finance needed road construction and repair activities into the foreseeable future  limiting factors that potentially could prevent these funds from being fully spent include the availability of necessary equipment and personnel in california to complete the work as well as extended period of inclement weather 
the strength of the california economy also influences demand for huntways asphalt and light end products 
the california economy began to recover in and has experienced continued growth through this has stimulated private demand for huntways asphalt products 
private demand for asphalt  however  currently constitutes approximately of huntways annual asphalt demand up from approximately to in and 
the improved california economy caused private construction to increase in the company believes private demand for asphalt will continue to expand for the next several years commensurate with the expected continued expansion of the california economy 
long term  huntway remains optimistic about the outlook for future growth in california  based on the level of existing expansion already underway and forecasts by several prominent economic studies 
this expected growth in the california economy should support continued growth in the demand for huntways products 
there can be no assurance  however  that the california economy will continue to expand as it has since or as forecasted by economic studies 
generally  cold  wet weather is not conducive to asphalt road construction 
accordingly  the company almost always experiences a loss in the first quarter of the year as a result of weak demand 
periods of unusually heavy rainfall such as occurred in the last quarter of and first five months of associated with the el nino weather phenomenon also depress asphalt demand and negatively impact profitability 
however  heavy rainfall does damage asphalt roads  increasing the backlog of needed road repairs 
barriers to entry in the asphalt market are limited 
the sophistication level of the required facilities is low  indicating that existing refineries could enter the market if they chose to do so 
the capital needed to undertake asphalt manufacturing at an existing california refinery operation is small by refinery standards 
permit issues for these existing refineries  while they exist  are not of such a nature that they are likely to be a significant deterrent to new entrants 
if a major existing california refinery operation decided to produce liquid asphalt in any meaningful volume  the supply demand relationship for asphalt in california could be severely disrupted with a resultant decline in asphalt prices and margins 
however  construction of new asphalt refineries is unlikely due to the significant difficulty of obtaining required permits 
newly constructed refineries would have high barriers to entry due to environmental regulations and the limited size of the market 
the company is subject to federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances that govern activities or operations that might have adverse environmental effects  and that impose liability for the costs of cleaning up  and certain damages resulting from sites of past spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous substances 
although management believes that the companys operations procedures and safety precautions are enforced  there can be no assurance that environmental problems will not occur in the future 
in summary  asphalt demand by both the public and private sector has increased over the past several years commensurate with increased public sourced funding and with the improving business climate in california 
public demand for asphalt funded primarily by caltrans increased in over as a result of substantial completion by early of earthquake related bridge retrofit work 
bridge retrofit projects utilize concrete and steel and use comparatively little asphalt 
in  as this work was nearing completion  more funds were available to be expended for road construction and repair 
moreover  in june  the billion federal highway bill was enacted 
california appropriations under this legislation over the next four years are expected to average approximately billion as compared to an average of only billion for the six years prior to private demand for asphalt has also increased commensurate with the expanding california economy 
this growth in private demand for asphalt is expected to continue as long as the growth in the california economy continues 
accordingly  the company anticipates that it should be able to pass increases in crude oil costs along to its customers in the form of higher prices within reasonable time periods 
additionally  the company estimates that approximately of its asphalt sales are tied to state highway department contracts that are subject to escalators or deescalators relating to the cost of crude oil 
as a result of the factors described above  while the company is generally optimistic regarding its future business prospects  the outlook is uncertain due to the nature of the business in which the company operates 
for example crude oil costs represent a large percentage of the total annual cash costs of the company ranging from to of costs depending on the cost of crude oil 
the company remains optimistic regarding growth in the sale of higher margin polymer based asphalt products 
as with conventional asphalt products  growth in the area of polymer sales is also dependent on funding availability that can rise and fall with the economic climate 
we expect the impact of the federal highway bill and the passage of proposition in california in to result in sufficient public funding for road construction and repair to keep asphalt demand strong 
at the present time  private demand for asphalt also looks strong as the california economy continues to expand 
this demand probably would decline however  with any downturn in the california economic environment 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could have resulted in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
management had previously determined that the year issue would not pose significant operational problems for either its computer systems it systems or its process controls non it systems and experienced no disruption of its business as a result of the rollover from to liquidity and capital resources the companys cash requirements and liquidity position are affected by various factors  including the selling prices for its refined products liquid asphalt and light end products and the price of crude oil 
the selling prices for asphalt products are influenced by the price of crude oil and by local market supply and demand factors for asphalt  including public and private demand for road construction and improvements 
the selling prices for huntways light end products naphtha  kerosene distillate and gas oil are also strongly impacted by the price of crude oil and by supply and demand factors for finished gasoline and diesel products in california 
fluctuations in the cost of crude oil are impacted by a myriad of market factors  both foreign and domestic 
the other primary factors that affect the companys investment requirements and liquidity position generally include the timing and funding of capital expenditures either to improve operations and business growth or to comply with environmental regulations  to provide for the funding of inventories and accounts receivables during periods of increasing crude costs and to provide for the funding of increasing inventory and accounts receivable during the months prior to and during the initial start of the annual paving season generally december through june 
cash flows cash decreased modestly to  at december  from  at december  this decline was principally the result of funding  of capital expenditures with internally generated cash flow 
cash increased to  at december  from  at december  this  increase in cash can be primarily attributed to improved operating results 
following is a summary of the major sources and uses of cash during  and net cash provided by operating activities totaled  in net income of  plus depreciation and amortization of  deferred income taxes of  and interest expense paid by the issuance of notes of  provided a combined  in cash 
increases in accounts payable relating to increased crude oil prices and a decrease in inventories resulting from an extended paving season due to dry warm weather through all of the fourth quarter in california provided an additional  in cash 
accounts receivable increased and used  in cash also as a result of the extended paving season as well as increased product prices due to the increase in crude oil costs 
prepaid expenses increased and used  in cash reflecting incurred turnaround costs 
accrued liabilities fell  using  in cash  as a result of lower incentive plan accruals and the utilization of tax credits associated with the increased level of capital expenditures to offset current income taxes payable 
the reduction in incentive plan accruals reflects changes made to the accrual formulas to take into account the expected improvement in results from the expansion and modernization of the benicia refinery 
investing activities used  in cash in property additions were primarily comprised of the expansion and modernization of the benicia refinery  as well as other smaller improvements at both refineries 
improvements to the benicia refinery consisted of a increase in process capacity  the construction of  gross barrels of production and storage tankage  improvements to the modified asphalt facility and other smaller additions 
additions to other assets primarily consisted of loan costs associated with both the new revolving credit facility from bank of america and the new senior debt facility 
to a lesser extent  additions to computer software also contributed to the increase in other assets 
these expenditures were offset by  in proceeds from the sale of certain pieces of process equipment located at the arizona facility 
financing activities used  in cash in primarily due to net repayment of long term obligations of  offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled  in net income of  plus depreciation and amortization of  deferred income taxes of  and interest expense paid by the issuance of notes of  provided a combined  in cash 
increases in accrued liabilities primarily relating to increased incentive plan accruals and higher pension and profit sharing k accruals provided  in cash 
incentive plan accruals increased due to increased levels of profitability 
cash was also generated from decreases in inventory of  the decrease in inventory reflects the decrease in the average cost of crude oil between years 
accounts receivable decreased and provided  in cash and reflected lower light end revenues due to depressed finished fuel prices 
prepaid expenses decreased and provided  in cash and reflected lower insurance and turnaround costs 
accounts payable declined using  in cash and reflects lower crude oil costs 
investing activities used  in cash in property additions were comprised of completion of the waste water treatment facility at the wilmington refinery as well as other smaller improvements at the wilmington refinery 
improvements at the benicia refinery consisted of engineering and other costs relating to the benicia improvement project  storage tank improvements  improvements to the modified asphalt facility and other smaller additions 
additions to other assets primarily consisted of deposits  additions to computer software and environmental manuals and plans 
financing activities used  in cash in and related to reductions of debt of  in addition  a net  in cash was generated from the sale of  shares in june commensurate with conversion to corporate form 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled  in net income of  plus depreciation and amortization of  and interest expense paid by the issuance of notes of  provided a combined  in cash 
decreases in accounts receivable generated  in cash and were caused by the timing of light end sales between years 
inventory increased using  in cash 
this increase reflects higher crude and finished goods inventory at benicia due to the timing of light end sales and lower than expected asphalt sales in december due to effects of wet weather 
prepaid expenses decreased providing  in cash and primarily reflects lower prepaid turnaround expenses as no major repair projects were incurred in accounts payable decreased using  in cash primarily due to the effect of lower crude oil prices between years 
accrued liabilities decreased using  in cash 
this decline reflects lower sunbelt related accruals substantially offset by higher interest expense accruals 
investment activities used  in cash in property additions reflect construction of the wastewater treatment facility at the wilmington refinery  construction of a pipeline to a customer at the wilmington refinery and costs to relocate the railroad loading rack at the wilmington refinery 
at benicia costs were incurred to improve the asphalt storage and delivery systems  to double bottom certain storage tanks  to replace heat exchangers  to purchase new heaters  to construct new pipelines and several other projects 
in addition  other assets increased  in and primarily relate to costs associated with raising  in convertible debt 
cash flows from financing activities in generated  in cash 
the october sale of convertible debt generated  in cash while  in payments were made to the state of arizona relating to the sunbelt environmental compliance agreement 
capital resources the companys outstanding long term debt was  at december  of this amount   was due within one year and the remainder has an average maturity of approximately years 
as of december  total long term debt amounted to of total capitalization shareholders equity plus borrowings and the company believes that it has additional long term borrowing capacity 
over the past three years the company has generated average cash flows from operations of  per year and the company believes that such internally generated liquidity  together with access to external resources will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans and also to provide some opportunity for additional growth 
the company believes its current level of letter of credit facility is sufficient to guarantee requirements for crude oil purchases  collateralization of other obligations and for hedging activities at current crude price levels 
however  due to the volatility in the price of crude oil there can be no assurance that these facilities will be adequate in the future 
if crude oil prices increased beyond the level of the companys letter of credit facilities  it would be required to prepay for crude oil or reduce its crude oil purchases  either of which would adversely impact profitability 
management continues to address all areas of the companys operations in an effort to improve profitability and shareholder value through growth in the business  improvement in operations  as well as reduction in costs 
the following summarizes the significant changes in the companys capitalization both currently planned and over the past three years the company presently anticipates that it will borrow an additional  from its existing senior lender in april to provide funding for a new  gross barrel storage tank at its benicia refinery 
this borrowing is anticipated to be amortized over a three year period with a final principal payment of  it is expected that additional storage capacity will enable the company to increase asphalt and light end production at its benicia refinery during periods of lower asphalt demand 
on october  the company terminated its then existing  letter of credit facility and entered into a new  revolving credit facility with bank of america  na the bank 
the new facility is collateralized by the companys current assets and is subject to a borrowing base limitation 
up to  of the facility may be borrowed for working capital purposes but it will primarily be used for the issuance of standby letters of credit for the purchase of crude oil 
borrowings under the facility generally bear interest at the banks reference rate  at december   while letter of credit fees are versus under the old facility on the face amount 
there is also a 
fee versus 
under the old facility on the unused portion of the facility 
up to  of this facility may be used for the issuance of standby letters of credit supporting crude oil hedging arrangements 
the facility expires on june  on january  the company obtained a new seven year   senior debt facility 
the facility bears interest at a fixed rate of 
proceeds from the borrowings were used to retire all  of huntways then existing senior debt  to pay transaction costs and to provide the company with a small amount of working capital 
this borrowing amortizes over an month period beginning in february monthly payments on the debt including principal and interest total approximately  on june  the company converted to corporate form 
accordingly  earnings generated subsequent to that date are subject to state and federal taxes 
in october the company issued  in senior subordinated secured convertible debt due the holders of the convertible debt can convert into equity at a share at any time 
huntway can force conversion after october  assuming certain trading criteria are met 
interest on the convertible debt notes is due on a semi annual basis payable  on june and  on december this transaction significantly improved huntways capital structure and provided the company with  in cash 
in addition it reduced required principal payments by  in on conversion of the convertible debt  total debt would decline  while annual interest expense would decline by  the average interest rate and weighted average debt outstanding during each of the past three years was as follows average interest weighted average rate debt outstanding scheduled fixed principal and cash interest payments in total  principal and cash interest payments totaled  in and  in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as previously noted  the companys profitability depends largely on the spread between market prices for its refined products and its crude oil costs 
a substantial and prolonged decrease in this overall spread would have a significant negative effect on the companys earnings  financial position and cash flows 
approximately half of huntways production consists of light products and half of asphalts 
the prices of huntways light products have historically followed changes in crude oil prices over to month time periods despite high short term volatility 
management believes that approximately of huntways asphalt unit sales volume will be covered by contractual escalation and deescalation clauses with various state highway agencies  which are based upon various crude oil cost indexes 
in an effort to mitigate the remaining risk  the company enters into contracts intended to partially hedge its exposure to crude oil price fluctuations 
historically  such contracts are zero cost collars under which the company receives or makes a monthly payment if crude oil prices for the month rise above  or fall below  the contracts ceiling or floor levels  respectively 
the company has entered into such arrangements covering approximately of its expected crude oil requirements for all of these arrangements provide that the company will receive approximately  per month so long as average monthly posted prices for california heavy san joaquin valley sjv crude oil exceeds and increasing by approximately  for every dollar by which the average posted price exceeds
