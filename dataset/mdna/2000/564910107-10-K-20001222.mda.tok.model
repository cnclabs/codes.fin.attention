item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with item selected financial data and item financial statements and supplementary data 
this discussion contains forward looking statements relating to our future financial performance  business strategy  financing plans and other future events that involve uncertainties and risks 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors  including but not limited to those discussed below in factors affecting future performance and elsewhere in this report 
see also special cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of item business 
the terms fiscal  fiscal and fiscal refer to our fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the term fiscal refers to our fiscal year ending september  overview we are a global developer of extended enterprise applications  or eea  that focuses on manufacturing establishments in discrete and batch process industries 
we deliver collaborative e business solutions to automate the manufacturing process  improve the coordination of organizational resources and enhance interaction with supply chain partners 
we acquired pivotpoint on january  for million in cash 
this strategic acquisition enabled us to immediately expand our manufacturing solutions across multiple platforms 
our flagship solutions now include both xa and the acquired point 
man product  two powerful extended enterprise applications that streamline business processes for manufacturing  customer service  engineering  supply chain planning and financials 
the solutions support international and multi site operations on a variety of platforms including the ibm eserver iseries  windows nt  unix and linux 
we also offer thru put  a supply chain management system  and teamwerx  a series of e business applications designed to enable companies to link members of their supply chain to send and receive valuable real time information to improve business decision making at all levels 
as a result of our acquisition of the pivotpoint business  our services revenue and cost of services have become more significant and our methods of selling our products have changed as follows 
our mix of revenue between license revenue and services revenue has changed 
services revenue increased from the date of acquisition through september  as a percentage of total revenue and may continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue in future periods because we now have a group of employee consultants that performs implementation and customization services 

our cost of services revenue has increased and may continue to increase in future periods 
prior to the acquisition of pivotpoint  our cost of services revenue principally included the costs of providing customer support 
following the acquisition  our cost of services revenue includes these costs plus the additional costs of providing customer support for point 
man  thru put  maincor and other products of the acquired pivotpoint business  and the costs associated with maintaining a group of employee consultants 

our mix of selling and marketing expenses has changed and may continue to change in future periods 
in addition to selling our products through our affiliates who sell on a commission basis  we now employ a direct sales force 
although we are working to integrate the activities of our direct sales force and our affiliates  a higher proportion of our total selling and marketing expenses is now fixed 
results of operations summary and outlook 
net income decreased from million  or per common share diluted  in fiscal to million  or per common share diluted  in fiscal for fiscal  we recorded a net loss of million or per common share diluted 
the net loss was primarily the result of write offs for restructuring and acquisition costs  amortization of goodwill  and special costs  which totaled million before income taxes 
excluding restructuring and acquisition costs  goodwill amortization  and special costs  net income was million  or per common share diluted 
total revenue increased in fiscal while operating expenses including restructuring and acquisitions costs  goodwill amortization  and other special costs increased 
the acquisition of pivotpoint was a primary contributor to the increase in revenue for fiscal although license revenue decreased  services revenue increased due to the additional services revenue generated from point 
man  thru put and the other products of the acquired pivotpoint business 
operating expenses excluding restructuring and acquisitions costs  goodwill amortization  and other special costs increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the overall increase in revenue and operating expenses primarily is a result of the pivotpoint acquisition 
revenue 
we generate a significant portion of our total revenue from licensing software  which is conducted principally through our global network of independent affiliates 
the affiliates provide the principal channel through which we sell our products 
however  the ultimate customer typically executes a license agreement directly with us rather than the affiliate 
when we first license our software  we receive both an initial license fee and a periodic fee 
we record initial license fees as license revenue and typically recognize them upon delivery of the software to the ultimate customer 
the periodic fee typically paid annually in advance  entitles the customer to receive annual support services  as available 
for all product lines other than the xa product line  we record these optional maintenance fees as services revenue and recognize this revenue ratably over the term of the agreement 
with respect to the xa product line  the periodic fee is an annual license fee  which entitles the customer to continuing use of the software 
if a customer does not renew its periodic fee of the xa product line  it is no longer entitled to use our software 
the annual license fee also entitles the customer to support services as available 
we record this fee as services revenue ratably over the term of the service agreement 
we believe this licensing arrangement provides a source of recurring revenue from our installed base of xa customers and enables our customers to take advantage of new releases and enhancements of our software 
the affiliates provide our customers with most of the consulting and implementation services relating to our products 
through our employee consultants  we provide consulting and implementation services for complex or multinational projects  and we provide some direct services for our acquired products 
we also offer educational courses and training materials to our customers and affiliates 
these consulting and implementation services  direct services  and education courses are included in services revenue 
we believe that over time the consulting services component will continue to increase as a percentage of total services revenue 
the following table shows information about our license revenue and our services revenue during the last three fiscal years change from years ended september  prior year license revenue    as a percentage of total revenue services revenue    as a percentage of total revenue total revenue    total license revenue declined from fiscal to fiscal although license sales to existing customers increased 
we believe the decrease in was attributable to the accelerated purchases by customers in related to the year event which would have typically occurred in or subsequent years 
in fiscal  license revenue continued to be adversely affected by the year event as a result of accelerated purchases in and this decrease was partially offset by the license revenues generated by the acquired pivotpoint business 
services revenue increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to a volume increase in the number of customers paying periodic fees 
the increase in fiscal was due principally to additional maintenance  consulting and other services revenue generated by the acquired pivotpoint business 
the mix of license revenue versus services revenue has been impacted by the acquisition of pivotpoint in fiscal as well as the decrease in license revenue related to the year event  and we expect that services revenue will continue to be a larger component of total revenue in fiscal however  we anticipate that the growth rate for services revenue will decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal our operations are conducted principally in north america  emea  and the latin america and the asia pacific regions  or laap 
the following table shows the percentage of total license and services revenue contributed by each of our primary geographic markets license revenue services revenue years ended september  years ended september  north america emea laap total additional information about our operations in these geographical areas is presented in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue consists primarily of royalties paid to solution partners for products we license  amortization of computer software costs  amortization of intangibles related to the pivotpoint acquisition and amortization of other intangible assets 
we license from our solution partners complementary software products or technology that have been or will be integrated into our product line 
generally  when we license a solution partner product to a customer  we pay a royalty to the solution partner 
as a result  a significant portion of our cost of license revenue varies in direct relation to license revenue based on the mix of internally developed and solution partner developed products 
through our solution partner arrangements  we have been able to enhance the functionality of our existing products and introduce new products utilizing this variable cost approach to expand our product offerings 
amortization of computer software costs represents recognition of the costs of some of the software products we sell  including purchased software costs  technology acquired in the acquisition of pivotpoint  capitalized software development costs and costs incurred to translate software into various foreign languages 
we begin amortization of computer software costs upon general release of the product to customers and compute amortization on a product by product basis based on the greater of the amount determined using 
the ratio that current period gross revenue bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenue  or 
the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product  which is generally five years for purchased software costs and software development costs and two years for software translation costs 
software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence and  as a result  future amortization periods for computer software costs could be shortened to reflect changes in technology in the future 
the following table shows information about our cost of license revenue during the last three fiscal years change years ended september from  prior year dollars in thousands cost of license revenue    as a percentage of license revenue as a percentage of total revenue cost of license revenue increased in fiscal and fiscal primarily as a result of increases in product royalty expense due to a change in the mix of products sold  including a higher percentage of products developed by solution partners 
during the last three fiscal years  the mix of products that we licensed to our customers has included increasing percentages of solution partner developed products  which has resulted in both increasing revenue and royalty costs 
as a result  product royalty expense has increased as a percentage of license revenue 
in addition  in fiscal the cost of license revenue increased due to amortization of intangible assets related to the pivotpoint acquisition and the write off of  of capitalized software translation costs  which was a special cost 
we expect that cost of license revenue will vary from period to period based on the mix of products licensed between internally developed products and solution partner developed products and the timing of computer software amortization costs 
cost of services revenue 
cost of services revenue consists primarily of 
personnel costs related to the ongoing maintenance and support of our products  
fees paid to affiliates outside our north american region to provide support services in those regions  
fees paid to solution partners to provide similar support services with respect to their products  
personnel costs related to implementation  consulting  and education services we provide  and 
costs of distributing our software products 
the following table shows information about our cost of services revenue during the last three fiscal years years ended september change from  prior year dollars in thousands cost of services revenue    as a percentage of services revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
cost of services revenue increased in fiscal as a result of additional distribution and support costs associated with the increase in customers  including 
a volume increase in fees paid to affiliates and solution partners for providing support services in emea and laap  and 
the hiring of additional customer support and services personnel 
in fiscal  the increase in cost of services was principally attributable to additional costs of providing customer support for the acquired pivotpoint products  and costs associated with maintaining a larger consulting staff related to the acquired products 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of commissions paid to our independent affiliates  compensation of our sales and marketing personnel  and direct costs associated with selling programs and marketing campaigns 
the following table shows information about our selling and marketing expenses during the last three fiscal years years ended september change from  prior year dollars in thousands selling and marketing expenses    as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal  selling and marketing expenses increased primarily as a result of hiring additional personnel and an increase in spending on marketing programs 
this increase was offset by a decrease in affiliate commissions due to the decrease in license revenue 
in fiscal  these expenses decreased principally due to a decrease in affiliate commissions  which was offset by an increase in direct sales costs and marketing programs 
we believe that affiliate commissions will fluctuate from period to period based on our product mix and the level of involvement of our direct sales organization 
product development expenses 
product development expenses consist of product development costs and software translation costs 
product development costs consist primarily of compensation for software engineering personnel and independent contractors retained to assist with our product development efforts 
we charge all costs of establishing technological feasibility of computer software products to product development expense as they are incurred 
from the time of establishing technological feasibility through general release of the product  computer software development and translation costs are capitalized and subsequently amortized to cost of license revenue 
software translation costs consist primarily of fees paid to consultants for translating some of our software into foreign languages 
the following table shows information about our product development expenses during the last three fiscal years years ended september change from  prior year dollars in thousands product development costs    software translation costs    less capitalized product development costs    capitalized software translation costs    plus write off of capitalized product development costs  product development expenses 
   as a percentage of total revenue product development costs increased in fiscal due to 
the hiring of additional product development personnel  
increased spending on product development activities to support the effort to re engineer our software applications to the windows nt server platform  and 
continued efforts to expand the xa product line 
product development costs decreased slightly in fiscal in connection with the acquisition of pivotpoint  we discontinued our product development efforts to re engineer our xa software applications to the windows nt server platform 
this decrease was largely offset by the cost associated with the development organization for the acquired products 
software translation costs  which decreased in fiscal and increased in fiscal  are typically project related  and the timing of those expenditures is subject to change from period to period 
the amounts of product development costs capitalized in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal represented   and of product development costs  respectively 
the amounts of software translation costs capitalized in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal represented   and of software translation costs  respectively 
capitalization rates are generally affected by the nature and timing of development activities and vary from period to period 
during fiscal  we wrote off million of capitalized software development costs due to a change in product development approach 
excluding this write off  overall product development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and  as a percentage of total revenue  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal  product development expenses of million remained relatively flat compared to the million in fiscal  excluding the write off of million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for executive  financial  legal and administrative personnel  outside professional and service fees  facility costs  provisions for bad debts  and special costs 
the following table shows information about our general and administrative expenses during the last three fiscal years years ended september change from  prior year dollars in thousands general and administrative expenses    less special costs  general and administrative expenses before special costs    as a percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal and fiscal and increased as a percentage of total revenue as a result of increased fixed costs of personnel and facilities associated with our expanded operations 
in fiscal  we incurred general and administrative costs related to the acquired pivotpoint business 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal include the following special costs 
million for the write off of non productive technology related assets 
these assets largely represent prepaid royalties for technology that we believe will not be recovered through future sales of the related products  and 
 for compensation expense recorded in connection with the acquisition of pivotpoint 
amortization of goodwill 
we completed two acquisitions during fiscal  both of which were treated as purchase business combinations for accounting purposes 
total goodwill recorded in these transactions was million  which we are amortizing over five years 
goodwill amortization for fiscal was million 
restructuring and acquisition costs 
in connection with the acquisition of pivotpoint  we recorded restructuring and acquisition costs of million 
of that amount  million represented restructuring and acquisition costs and million represented the write off of acquired in process research and development costs  or ipr d 
based on an independent appraisal  we allocated million of the total purchase price of pivotpoint to two ipr d projects which were in the development stage at the time of the acquisition and had not yet reached technological feasibility 
the projects are for the enhancement of the point 
man product to allow our customers to extend their interaction throughout their value chain and for extending thru put s capacity for multi site planning 
the projects were valued using a discounted cash flow methodology  based on the estimated future earnings of the product multiplied by the estimated percentage of project completion 
information regarding acquired ipr d at the acquisition date is as follows in thousands estimated ipr d percentage allocation complete pointman thru put total  because the ipr d projects had not reached technological feasibility  we expensed the million immediately following the acquisition 
both of these projects reached technological feasibility during fiscal additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we re evaluated our overall product strategy as a result of our acquisition and decided to devote greater efforts towards the e business  supply chain management and windows nt products 
as a result  we incurred restructuring costs of million in connection with the reduction of our employee base by approximately primarily related to the development activities for our eea products  the abandonment of excess space  and the write off of certain technology related assets 
prior to the acquisition of pivotpoint  we were engaged in product development activities to re engineer our xa applications to the windows nt server platform 
we made the decision to discontinue our nt development effort for the xa applications because pivotpoint s eea  point 
man  runs on multiple platforms  including windows nt  unix and linux 
accordingly  we wrote off computer software costs related to our nt development  and we accrued costs for contractual obligations arising from the termination of a third party technology alliance for the development of a tool to modify our software to work in the nt environment 
following the acquisition of pivotpoint  we had two advanced planning and scheduling  or aps  solutions among our product offerings 
after an extensive evaluation of both products  we selected thru put as our aps solution because of the product s e business capabilities  quick implementation  return on investment for customers  ease of use and best of breed functionality 
furthermore  we established plans to migrate existing customers to thru put 
accordingly  we wrote off computer software costs and other assets relating to the former aps product  and we accrued costs for contractual obligations arising from the termination of a related third party technology alliance 
the major components of the restructuring and acquisition costs during fiscal were as follows in thousands employee severance and related costs acquisition related change in product strategy  exit costs for terminated contracts costs of abandonment of excess space non cash asset write offs acquisition related write off of purchased software and other assets  in process research and development costs  change in product strategy  the following table summarizes all of the restructuring and acquisition costs and special costs incurred in fiscal in thousands cost of general and restructuring and license administrative acquisition costs total non cash asset write offs prepaid royalties    capitalized software costs  including in process research and development costs   accrual of royalty contract obligation   other assets employee severance  special compensation  and related costs   exit costs for terminated contracts costs of abandonment of excess space interest income and interest expense 
the following table shows information about our interest income and interest expense during the last three fiscal years years ended september  dollars in thousands interest income   interest expense  interest income expense  net   interest income increased in fiscal due primarily to increases in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents 
in fiscal  we also recognized additional interest income of  related to federal income tax refunds due to us 
interest income in fiscal decreased primarily due to a reduction in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense in fiscal and reflects commitment fees incurred for unused portions of the revolving credit facility 
interest expense in fiscal increased significantly beginning in january as a result of borrowings under our new bank credit facility 
interest expense principally includes interest on our term loan based on our lender s base rate or libor plus a predetermined margin  the difference between interest paid and interest received under our interest rate protection arrangement  commitment fees on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility  and amortization of debt issuance costs 
the weighted average interest rate for fiscal was 
see liquidity and capital resources 
income tax expense benefit 
the following table shows information about our income tax expense benefit during the last three fiscal years years ended september dollars in thousands income before income tax expense benefit    income tax expense benefit    effective income tax rate the effective tax rate for fiscal and fiscal differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of principally due to the impact of state and foreign income taxes 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal differs from the statutory federal rate of principally due to the effect of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not deductible for income tax purposes  and foreign income tax expense offset by income tax credits utilized during the year 
we are amortizing goodwill and other intangible assets from the acquisition of pivotpoint over periods ranging from five to seven years 
accordingly  we expect our effective tax rate to be higher than the statutory federal rate while we record amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not deductible for income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources the following tables show information about our cash flows during the last three fiscal years and selected balance sheet data as of september  and you should read these tables and the discussion that follows in conjunction with our statements of cash flows and balance sheets contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
summary of cash flows fiscal years ended september  dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities    changes in operating assets and liabilities   net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used for investing activities    net cash provided by used for financing activities    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    balance sheet data september dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents   working capital deficit   working capital  excluding deferred revenue   we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities supplemented in fiscal by borrowings of million under our new bank credit facility to finance the acquisition of pivotpoint 
the changes in net cash provided by operating activities generally reflect the changes in earnings plus the effect of changes in working capital 
changes in working capital  especially trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and accrued expenses  are generally the result of timing differences between collection of fees billed and payment of operating expenses 
during fiscal  growth in earnings was primarily responsible for the increase in net cash provided by operating activities 
changes in operating assets and liabilities also had a positive effect on cash flows for those years 
specifically  in fiscal  the following changes in operating assets and liabilities had a positive effect on operating cash flows 
a million increase in deferred revenue due to growth in periodic license fees  and 
a million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities due to increases in income taxes  sales taxes and employee bonuses payable 
those increases were offset partially by a million increase in accounts receivable principally resulting from the continued growth in revenue 
in fiscal  a decrease in net income contributed to a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities 
working capital changes in fiscal further reduced net cash flows provided by operating activities  including 
a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets due to prepayments of product royalties  advances to affiliates  and accrued interest receivable related to income tax refunds  
a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities due to decreases in affiliate commissions and product royalties because of the decrease in license revenue  and 
a million decrease in deferred revenue due to decreases in multi year license agreements and deferred initial license fees 
those changes were offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable due to improvements in our collection efforts and write offs of uncollectible accounts receivable 
in fiscal  the net loss significantly contributed to the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the net loss was primarily the result of write offs for restructuring and acquisition costs and special costs  which totaled million before income taxes 
in fiscal  the following changes in operating assets and liabilities affected operating cash flows 
a million increase in deferred revenue related to our expanded customer base  
a million increase in accounts receivable as a result of an increase in total revenue  and 
a million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in january  we purchased the stock of pivotpoint  inc for million  including transaction costs of million and net of cash acquired of million 
we also assumed long term debt of million 
to finance this acquisition  we borrowed million under the term loan portion of our new bank credit facility 
we also used million of our operating cash to pay for the acquisition and related transaction costs  including million of debt issue costs 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets in the united states as collateral for our obligations under the bank credit facility 
additionally  all of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the repayment of our obligations under the bank credit facility  and we have pledged a majority of the capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries to the lenders 
the bank credit facility as amended contains covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain specific financial ratios and impose limitations or prohibitions on us with respect to 
incurrence of indebtedness  liens and capital leases  
payment of dividends on our capital stock  
redemption or repurchase of our capital stock  
investments and acquisitions  
mergers and consolidations  and 
disposition of our properties or assets outside the course of ordinary business 
the term loan requires quarterly principal repayments in various amounts and matures on december  during fiscal  we repaid million of long term debt  including million under the term loan and million of debt assumed in the acquisition of pivotpoint 
the interest rate on the term loan portion of the bank credit facility varies depending upon our ability to maintain certain specified financial ratios 
the interest rate is generally adjusted quarterly based on either our lender s base rate or libor plus a predetermined margin 
at september   the interest rate on our term loan  including the lender s margin  was 
the bank credit facility required us to enter into an interest rate protection arrangement 
accordingly  we entered into an interest rate swap with a bank which limits our exposure on a significant portion of our term loan 
our fiscal weighted average interest rate was 
in october  we amended the terms of the bank credit facility and we repaid an additional million of the term loan 
we have never borrowed any funds under the revolving credit portion of any bank credit facility  and in connection with the october amendment of the bank credit facility  the revolving credit portion was suspended pending future reinstatement based upon mutually acceptable terms 
at such time  if any  that the revolving credit portion is reinstated  we would be able to borrow up to million under the revolving credit loan  subject to certain limitations 
any such borrowings would mature on january  we pay a quarterly commitment fee for unused portions of the revolving credit facility 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we used cash for investing activities related to computer software development  translation of our computer software products and purchases of property and equipment 
also  we spent million  million and  respectively  in those years to acquire rights to complementary computer software to be integrated with our product offerings 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we received proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchases of million  million  and million  respectively 
in fiscal  we purchased  shares of common stock for million 
in fiscal  we purchased  shares of common stock for million and retired the  shares that were acquired in fiscal at september   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million and research and experimentation and other credit carryforwards of million 
approximately million of the net operating loss carryforward resulted from the acquisition of the pivotpoint business 
the net operating losses and tax credits at september  expire between and the utilization of a significant portion of the net operating losses and tax credits is limited on an annual basis due to various changes in ownership of both mapics and pivotpoint 
we do not believe that these limitations will significantly impact our ability to utilize the net operating losses and tax credits before they expire 
these income tax attributes enabled us to reduce cash paid for income taxes in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  and we believe they will continue to result in cash savings in future periods as we use them to offset income taxes payable 
we have recorded the net deferred tax assets at the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we do not have any current plans or commitments for any significant capital expenditures 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand as of september   together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to maintain our operations for at least the next months 
inflation to date  we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
recently issued pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including some derivative instruments which are embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
the statement requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure the instruments at fair value 
on october   we adopted sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
a and sab no 
b  which is effective no later than the fourth fiscal quarter of our fiscal year ending september  sab no 
provides guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
additionally  the sec recently issued a frequently asked questions memorandum providing further guidance on sab no 
although we do not currently expect the adoption of sab no 
to have a material impact on our licensing practices  financial position or results of operations  we are still assessing the possible effects of sab no 
furthermore  additional guidance pertaining to revenue recognition could result in unexpected modifications to our current revenue recognition practices  which could materially adversely impact our past or future revenue  results of operations and financial condition 
in march  the fasb released interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
this interpretation provides guidance for certain issues that arise in the application of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the provisions of this interpretation became effective on july  the adoption of interpretation no 
did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
factors affecting future performance various factors outside our control may affect our operating results and cause fluctuations in our quarterly results 
our future success depends on a number of factors  many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control 
moreover  many of these factors are likely to cause our operating results  cash flows and liquidity to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future 
these factors include  among others 
the size and timing of our license transactions because our license revenue in any quarter depends substantially on the number and size of orders booked and shipped to customers in that quarter  
the proportion of our revenue attributable to fees for licenses versus fees for services  
the proportion of products we license that are developed by us versus those developed solely by a third party or by us in collaboration with a third party  
how much money we must spend to improve our business and expand our operations  
changes in the level of our operating expenses  
delays in the purchase of our products and services by our customers due to their capital expenditure limitations and the time they often require to authorize purchases of our products and services  
the demand for our products and services  
whether customers accept the new and enhanced products and services we offer  
how quickly we are able to develop new products and services that our customers require  
whether and how quickly alternative technologies  products and services introduced by our competitors gain market acceptance  
the timing of the introduction of new or enhanced products offered by our competitors or us  
the ability of our affiliates to sell products or service additional sales  
the competitive conditions in our industry  
whether we and our affiliates are able to hire and retain our personnel  
prevailing conditions in the eea marketplace and other general economic and political factors 
due to one or more of these factors  our operating results could fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if that happens  the price of our common stock could decline materially 
the market for business software in the mid sized manufacturing industry is highly competitive 
the market for business software in the mid sized manufacturing industry is highly competitive and changes rapidly 
the market activities of industry participants  such as new product introductions  frequently result in increased competition 
our competitors offer a variety of products that address this and similar markets 
we primarily compete with a large number of independent software vendors  including 
adexa  inc 
computer associates  inc  
datastream systems  inc  
geac computer corporation limited  
industrial financial systems  ab  
intentia ab  
i technologies  
jd edwards company  inc  
qad  inc  
sap ag  
symix systems inc  and 
synquest  inc we also compete with some vendors of specialized applications 
we may be unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
to be successful in the future  we must respond promptly and effectively to changes in technology 
we must also respond to our competitors innovations 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  service  support and technical resources than we do 
some of these competitors also have greater name recognition than we do 
accordingly  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of products 
we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for business software and as new products and technologies are introduced 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make acquisitions or establish alliances among themselves or with others 
these acquisitions or alliances could increase the ability of competitors products to address the needs of our current or prospective customers 
as a result  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain a significant share of the eea market 
for us  this could result in fee reductions  the loss of current or prospective customers  fewer customer orders  and reduced revenue 
in addition  we principally rely on our network of affiliates for the implementation of our products 
if the affiliates fail to maintain sufficiently high quality standards  our reputation and competitive position could weaken 
any or all of these events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to risks resulting from rapid technological change and evolving industry standards 
the market for our enterprise software products is constantly changing 
these changes include  among others 
rapid technological advances  including those that make use of the internet  
evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology  
changes in customer requirements  and 
frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
our future success depends upon our ability to continue to enhance our products  as well as our ability to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
in particular  we must anticipate and respond adequately to advances in the functionality of standard business applications software and internet technology to deploy these systems 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to develop and market new products and product enhancements that achieve market acceptance on a timely and cost effective basis 
as a result of the high level of functionality and performance demanded by enterprise software customers  major new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
despite testing  however  the complex enterprise software programs we offer may contain errors that customers discover only after the programs have been installed and used 
undetected errors may impair the market acceptance of our products or adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
problems encountered by customers installing and implementing our new products or releases or with the performance of new products  including product functionality  product response time and program errors  also could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly operating results are concentrated toward the end of each quarter and are difficult to predict 
our revenue occur predominantly in the third month of each quarter and tend to be concentrated in the latter half of that third month 
as a result  our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict 
delays in product delivery or in closings of sales near the end of a quarter could cause our quarterly revenue to fall substantially short of the levels we anticipate 
moreover  we establish our spending levels based on our expected future operating results 
if results of operations are less than we anticipate  we may not be able to reduce spending levels proportionately 
as a consequence  our operating results  cash flows and liquidity will likely be adversely affected 
these and other factors are likely to continue to affect our results of operations 
due to these factors  our operating results could fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if that happens  the price of our common stock could decline materially 
if our operating performance does not support our cash flow requirements  we may breach our bank credit facility 
our bank credit facility has a number of financial and operating performance covenants that we have had to amend and that we will have to satisfy for the remainder of the bank credit facility 
our ability to satisfy those covenants and to service debt that we incur under our bank credit facility depends principally upon our ability to achieve positive operating performance and to successfully manage our working capital in order to support our cash flow requirements 
if our quarterly operating performance falls substantially below our expectations or if we are not able to effectively manage our collection efforts or cash expenditures in a given quarter  we may not be able to fully support our cash flow requirements 
in that case  we may be unable to fully satisfy the financial and operating performance covenants of the bank credit facility or to meet our debt service obligations  thereby breaching the terms of the bank credit facility 
we have secured our obligations under the bank credit facility by pledging substantially all of our assets in the united states as collateral 
additionally  all of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the repayment of our obligations under the bank credit facility  and we have pledged a majority of the capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries to the lenders 
any breach of our covenants or inability to satisfy our debt service requirements could result in a default under our bank credit facility and an acceleration of payment of all outstanding debt owed  which could materially and adversely effect our business 
we are subject to risks associated with making acquisitions and may not be able to grow through acquisitions 
as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary technologies  products and businesses in the enterprise application market 
in our pursuit of acquisitions  we may be unable to 
identify suitable acquisition candidates  
compete for acquisitions with other companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than we do  
obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions  
complete the acquisitions on terms favorable to us  
integrate acquired technologies  products and businesses into our existing operations  and 
profitably manage acquired technologies  products and businesses 
on january   we acquired pivotpoint  inc which offers eea solutions that can operate on multiple platforms 
this acquisition and other acquisitions that we may undertake in the future involve a number of risks 
some of these risks are that 
technologies  products or businesses that we acquire may not perform as expected  
technologies  products or businesses that we acquire may not achieve levels of revenue  profitability or productivity comparable to our existing technologies  products and operations  
acquisitions may adversely affect our results of operations  
acquisitions may divert the attention of management and our resources  
we may experience difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and personnel  and 
we may experience difficulty in retaining  hiring and training key personnel 
any or all of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our product development and enhancement efforts depend in part on other software companies 
many of our applications were developed by our solution partners  and we expect to continue to rely on solution partners for the development of additional applications 
generally  solution partners continue to own the rights to  and maintain  the technology underlying the applications but license the technology to us 
under a license agreement with a solution partner  we ordinarily are obligated to pay a royalty to the solution partner for sales of the applications developed by the solution partner 
we may also develop alliances where we jointly market products offered by third parties 
if we fail to pay the required royalty when due or otherwise breach the agreements  the solution partner may terminate the agreement 
the unwillingness of a solution partner to renew its agreement or the termination of an agreement with a solution partner could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends in part on our continued ability to license applications from solution partners 
however  solution partners may not be available to develop or support applications for us in the future 
even if available  solution partners may not complete applications for us on a timely basis and within acceptable guidelines 
accordingly  we cannot assure that we will be able make available applications from solution partners that are acceptable in the market or at all 
a solution partner may also have or develop a relationship with our existing or prospective customers or affiliates 
the solution partner may use this relationship to become a competitor of ours 
if a solution partner is already a competitor  it may use this relationship to enhance its competitive position 
the solution partner could  as a competitor or otherwise  cause us to lose existing or prospective customers 
the occurrence of any of the events described above could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in protecting our proprietary rights or in avoiding claims that we infringe the proprietary rights of others 
our success depends heavily upon the protection of our proprietary software 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and license and non disclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and information 
to further protect these rights  we enter into confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees  distributors  contractors  customers and potential customers and limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  an unauthorized person could copy or reverse engineer some portions of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our steps to protect our software will be adequate 
moreover  our competitors may independently develop software products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our software products 
we may receive notices claiming that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others 
third parties could also institute legal proceedings against us claiming that our current or future products infringe their proprietary rights 
alternatively  we may make claims or initiate litigation against others for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
any claims against us  with or without merit  or claims by us against others could be time consuming and expensive to defend  prosecute or resolve 
in addition  these claims could cause product shipment delays or force us to enter into royalty or license agreements rather than dispute the merits of the claims 
moreover  an adverse outcome in litigation or a similar adversarial proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to others  require us to allocate significant resources to develop non infringing technology  require disputed rights to be licensed from others  or prohibit us from using specific marketing materials or products 
if we are required to license proprietary rights from others or wish to do so  we cannot assure you that the necessary licenses will be available on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
one or more of these events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price will fluctuate  and could fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future 
various factors and events have caused this fluctuation and are likely to cause the fluctuations to continue 
these factors include  among others 
quarterly variation in our actual or anticipated operating results  
the depth and liquidity of the trading market for our common stock  
the growth rate of our revenue  
changes by securities analysts in estimates regarding us  
conditions in the enterprise software industry  
the condition of the stock market  
announcements by our competitors  
regulatory actions affecting us  and 
general economic conditions 
in addition  from time to time the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations 
stock market fluctuations have particularly affected the stock prices of technology companies  including ours 
these fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
furthermore  our operating results and prospects from time to time may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
any such event could cause the market price of our common stock to decline materially 
we depend on the worldwide manufacturing industry 
our business depends substantially upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers 
in turn  these expenditures depend in part upon the demand for these manufacturers products 
a recession or other adverse event affecting the worldwide manufacturing industry could cause manufacturers in our target market to reduce or postpone capital expenditures for business information systems 
this change in the amount or timing of capital expenditures by manufacturers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to the risk of product liability claims 
our products are generally used to manage data critical to large organizations 
these organizations also share this critical data with others in their value chain using the internet or other networks 
there are many security risks inherent with making data available over a network and in sharing data with third parties  and our products are not designed to safeguard against all such risks 
we occasionally deliver implementation services to our customers 
as a result  our development  sale  implementation service and support of products may entail the risk of product liability claims 
our license and service agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  these provisions may not be effective under the laws of all jurisdictions 
in addition  our liability insurance may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover all claims if our contractual limitations on liability are ineffective 
a successful product liability claim brought against us could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  defending such a suit  regardless of its merits  could require us to incur substantial expense and require the time and attention of key management personnel 
this could also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on the availability of skilled personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our future performance depends upon the continued service of a number of senior management and key technical personnel 
the loss or interruption of the services of one or more key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future financial results also will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
we do not currently maintain key person life insurance on any of our key employees 
competition for qualified personnel is intense and is likely to intensify in the future 
we compete for qualified personnel against numerous companies  including larger  more established companies with significantly greater financial resources than ours 
we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified personnel 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to hire qualified personnel or if we are unable to retain qualified personnel in the future 
we depend on ibm s eserver iseries series of computers for a significant portion of our revenue 
we continue to depend on the market for software products on the ibm eserver iseries platform 
most of the revenue for fiscal and substantially all of our revenue for fiscal was derived from the licensing of our software product and related services for this platform 
we will continue to offer enhanced software products for this market  but there is no guarantee that our existing or prospective customers will buy or support these products 
the eserver iseries market is expected to grow at a minimal rate  and there can be no assurance that it will grow at all in the future 
our future growth depends  in part  on our ability to gain market share 
there can be no assurance that we can maintain or increase our relative share of this market 
we depend on a network of independent local companies to sell and support our products 
we market  sell and provide professional services for our products primarily through a global network of more than independent local affiliates 
we also maintain a limited direct sales force 
we rely on our affiliates for sales  product implementation  customization and  outside of north america  certain customer support services that are provided in conjunction with us 
if we are unable to maintain effective long term relationships with our affiliates  or if our affiliates fail to meet our customers needs  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
from time to time some of our competitors have established  and may continue to seek to establish  a comparable distribution channel  in part by attempting to attract our affiliates 
our agreements with affiliates are generally of short duration and can be terminated by an affiliate in some instances 
if the affiliates reduce or discontinue their relationships with us or their support of our products  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
in addition  the ability of the affiliates to meet our customers needs depends upon their ability to attract  develop  motivate and retain highly skilled professionals and technical personnel 
these personnel are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected  if the affiliates are unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of professional and technical personnel 
we may not be able to effectively manage our growth 
our business has grown significantly in the last five years 
this growth has strained  and may continue to strain  our management and systems 
our future operating results depend in part on the ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational and financial controls  to expand  train and manage our employees effectively  to manage the integration of acquired businesses  and to successfully develop new products and enhancements to existing products 
our growth also depends upon our ability to retain and attract new affiliates  and our affiliates ability to grow  to manage their growth and to implement our products in response to the projected demands of our customers 
we cannot assure you that we or our affiliates will be able to successfully market and sell our new products or that either we or our affiliates will be able to successfully manage any future expansion 
our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected if we or our affiliates are unable to effectively manage our growth 
our international operations subject us to a number of risks 
a substantial portion of our business comes from outside the united states 
we believe that our continued growth and profitability will require expansion of our sales in international markets 
to expand international sales successfully  we have invested  and will continue to invest  substantial resources to establish new foreign operations  improve existing or establish new affiliate relationships  and hire additional personnel 
international expansion of our operations has required  and will continue to require  us to localize our applications and translate them into foreign languages 
if we cannot expand our international operations or localize and translate our applications in a timely and accurate manner  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  even if we successfully expand our international operations  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our international market presence or demand for our products 
risks inherent in our international business activities include  among others 
the imposition of government controls  
restrictions on the export of critical technology  
political and economic instability  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and devaluation of foreign currencies  
trade restrictions  
difficulties in staffing international offices  
difficulty in collecting or the inability to collect fees  
longer accounts receivable payment collection cycles in some countries  
burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  
management of an organization spread over various countries  
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
overlap of different tax structures  and 
the lack of effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection in some countries where we sell our products 
any or all of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the continued expansion of our international operations  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies in which we conduct our business may cause us to experience currency transaction gains and losses 
because of the number of foreign currencies involved  our constantly changing currency exposure and the volatility of currency exchange rates  we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
these currency risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the conversion to a single european currency may adversely affect us 
on january   of the member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
in  each of these participating countries will adopt the euro as their single currency 
although we believe the conversion has not had a substantial effect on our european operations in fiscal  we are unsure of the potential impact that the conversion will have on our business as the number of transactions conducted in the euro increases 
the conversion may involve a number of risks for us  including 
increased costs of conducting business during this transition period in which our operations and those of others will be conducted in either existing or legacy currencies as well as the euro  
increased risks of conducting business in multiple currencies resulting from  among other things  changes in currency exchange cost  and the impact of this risk on currency swaps  
difficulty for us and others in the performance of contracts requiring payments in legacy currencies  
third parties  like our suppliers and service providers  may be unable to operate using the euro and may have difficulty reporting transactions during the euro conversion  
increased competition resulting from greater access of competitors to european markets and the consolidation of competitors operations to pursue economies of scale by treating europe as a single market  
the participating countries pursuit of a single monetary policy through a central european bank  
the impact that salaries paid in euros will have on our international employees who prefer local currencies  
possible decreases of the selling prices of our software to the lowest euro level when customers compare prices based on the euro  
uncertainty as to whether foreign countries will require restatement of the share capital of their foreign affiliates  
release of xa  which is designed to enable companies to process financial transactions in the euro and the local national currencies  may not satisfactorily address all conversion issues  and the costs to resolve any resulting conversion related errors could be significant  and 
if we are required to process a significant amount of financial transactions in the euro before we are able to implement release of xa for our internal use  or if subsequently release of xa does not allow us to satisfactorily process financial transactions in the euro  we may incur significant unforeseen costs or experience signficient disruption to our business 
any or all of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have adopted measures that have anti takeover effects and could limit the price of our stock 
georgia law and our articles of incorporation  bylaws and shareholder rights plan contain provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  discourage acquisition bids for us  discourage changes in our management  and limit the price that investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
the most significant of these provisions are described below 
provisions of georgia law have anti takeover effects 
georgia law prohibits us from entering into some business combination transactions with any person for a period of five years from the date the person becomes an interested shareholder  unless specific requirements are satisfied 
generally  an interested shareholder is any person that owns at least of our outstanding voting stock  other than us and our subsidiaries 
georgia law also requires that each of these transactions 
meets specific fair price criteria and other tests  or 
meets specific requirements relating to approval of the transaction by our board of directors and shareholders 
we have issued preferred stock and may issue additional preferred stock in the future 
we have issued shares of our preferred stock in the past and may issue additional shares of preferred stock in the future without further shareholder approval 
any future issuance of preferred stock will have the terms  conditions  rights  privileges and preferences that our board of directors determines 
the rights of holders of our common stock are subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of holders of our preferred stock 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain additional provisions that have anti takeover effects 
our board of directors is divided into three classes 
each class serves for a staggered three year term 
in addition  a director may only be removed from the board for cause and upon the vote of at least of all classes of stock entitled to vote in the election of the director 
this classification of our board of directors and limitation on the removal of directors could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to gain control of our board of directors 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain additional provisions that have anti takeover effects 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan under which we have distributed to our shareholders rights to purchase shares of our series f junior participating preferred stock 
if specific triggering events occur  the holders of the rights will be able to purchase shares of our common stock at a price substantially discounted from the then applicable market price of our common stock 
the shareholder rights plan could increase a potential acquirer s costs of effecting a merger with us or a tender offer for our outstanding securities that is not approved by our board of directors 
these increased costs could prevent or discourage such a transaction  even though our shareholders might want to vote in favor of the merger or participate in the tender offer 
shares of our outstanding stock are currently eligible for future sale  and some holders of our securities have registration rights 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the prospect of these sales  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
these sales or the prospect of these sales could also impair our ability to raise needed funds in the capital markets at a time and price favorable to us 
as of december   we had a total of  shares of common stock outstanding  most of which are freely tradable without restriction under the securities act of  as amended 
the remaining outstanding shares will be eligible for sale in the public market at various times pursuant to rule under the securities act 
as of december   we had options outstanding under our stock option plans for the purchase of a total of  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
we have reserved an additional  shares of common stock that we may issue upon the exercise of options granted in the future under these plans 
we have also reserved  shares of common stock that we may issue under our employee stock purchase plan 
we have in effect a registration statement under the securities act covering our issuance of shares upon the exercise of these outstanding options and our issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
all of these shares will be freely tradable in the public market  except for shares held by our directors  officers and principal shareholders  which will be eligible for public sale at various times pursuant to rule we have in effect a registration statement under the securities act covering the sale of  shares of common stock that we will issue upon the exercise of warrants 
these warrants are exercisable at a price of per share 
in addition  entities affiliated with general atlantic partners  llc have demand and piggyback registration rights for  shares of common stock that are issuable upon the exercise of warrants that are exercisable at a price of per share   shares of common stock that are issuable upon the conversion of our convertible preferred stock and  shares of outstanding common stock 
the demand registration rights permit the holders of these securities to require us to register the sale of this common stock under the securities act 
the piggyback registration rights permit the holders of these securities to participate in any registration of our common stock under the securities act 
another of our shareholders also has piggyback registration rights for  shares of common stock that we will issue upon the conversion of our convertible preferred stock 
if these holders require us to include their shares in a registration that we initiate  it could adversely affect our ability to raise needed capital in the public market at a favorable time and price 
the  shares of common stock underlying our convertible preferred stock and the  shares of common stock held directly by entities affiliated with general atlantic partners currently are eligible for sale in the public market subject to the conditions of rule in addition  the  shares of common stock underlying the warrants held by entities affiliated with general atlantic partners will be eligible for sale in the public market at any future time or times permitted by rule our financial information as of dates and for periods prior to the distribution may have only limited relevance 
the mapics business has operated as a separate  stand alone company since july   the date of the distribution 
in preparing our combined financial statements and other financial information as of dates and for periods prior to the distribution  we have allocated some expenses based on our estimates of the cost of services marcam corporation provided to the mapics business prior to the distribution 
as a result  the combined financial statements and other financial information as of dates and for periods prior to the distribution may not be comparable to our financial statements and other financial information as of dates and for periods after the distribution 
moreover  the combined financial statements and other financial information may not necessarily reflect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the future 
we cannot predict every event and circumstance which may impact our business and  therefore  the risks and uncertainties discussed above may not be the only ones you should consider 
the risks and uncertainties discussed above are in addition to those that apply to most businesses generally 
in addition  as we continue to grow our business  we may encounter other risks of which we are not aware at this time 
these additional risks may cause serious damage to our business in the future  the impact of which we cannot estimate at this time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity our foreign operations  primarily those in western europe  involve financial transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts or purchase options to minimize the effect of changes in exchange rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in fiscal and  we incurred net foreign currency transaction losses of  and  respectively  mostly due to transactions within emea 
we did not have any open forward exchange contracts or options at september  or as our foreign operations increase  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by future changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for further information see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors affecting future performance our international operations subject us to a number of risks 
interest rate sensitivity the table below presents information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates at september   including our long term debt obligation and our interest rate swap arrangement 
for our long term debt obligation  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates based on the scheduled principal payments 
for our interest rate swap arrangement  the table presents average notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the interest rate swap arrangement 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the eurodollar futures curve for three month libor at the reporting date 
fiscal year of maturity total fair value dollars in thousands liabilities long term debt      average variable interest rate interest rate swap average notional principal amount   fixed pay interest rate average receive variable interest rate we believe that the fair value of our long term debt is equal to its book value because our long term debt is with a bank and not publicly traded  and because the underlying variable interest rate is adjusted every three months
