inflation the company does not believe that inflation in the united states or europe in recent years has had a significant effect on its results of operations 
year the company performed a review of its computer systems and operations for vulnerability to year yk issues 
the situations occur because many computer systems and programs existing prior to january  process transactions using two digits rather than four digits for the year of a transaction 
unless modified  a year transaction might be processed as the year  potentially causing systems or programs to fail or create erroneous results 
the company completed the review of its management information software mis  edi software  and local area network and personal computer operating systems prior to january  to determine their system s yk compliance status 
this review included communications with suppliers  contractors and customers to evaluate their yk compliance  including edi software evaluation 
based on those received to date  no response has indicated that our key customers  contractors and suppliers were not yk compliant 
these communications also indicated that major customers tested their edi systems for internal  intermediary and supplier yk compliance  and found them to be yk compliant 
the effect of non compliance by independent manufacturers and other third parties was not determinable 
the mis systems  including the local area network and computer hardware at the company s us headquarters and hong kong subsidiary  were tested  and upgraded or replaced as necessary to be fully yk compliant 
the company incurred expense of approximately  through december  in making its computer systems and programs yk compliant 
these costs were funded from existing cash and cash flow from operations 
any additional charges are expected to be minimal 
to date  the company has not experienced any yk issues with its internal operating systems or with its customers or suppliers 
in addition  the company did not experience any loss in revenues due to the yk issues 
although unlikely  there can be no assurance future unforeseen yk issues will not occur 
the company does not believe  however  that there will be any material impact on the company s operation
