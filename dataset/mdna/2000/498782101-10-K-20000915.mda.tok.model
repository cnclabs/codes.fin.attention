this was a slight decline from fiscal and was due exclusively to the impact of hirsh sales in fiscal excluding the impact of the hirsh company  which was sold in september  fiscal net sales were million 
accordingly  on like sales  fiscal net sales actually increased approximately million or 
the growth resulted from the ergonomic products introduced as a result of the acquisition of idea industries and strong sales of the company s precision drawer slides 
the company continues to successfully target the oem office furniture market with its products  however  the retail market remains highly competitive and price sensitive 
as a result  management must evaluate opportunities in this market on a customer by customer basis 
net sales in fiscal declined million  or to million 
the most significant decline was in shelving systems and was primarily due to the sales contribution of hirsh 
in addition  the company performed a profitability review of its current product offerings and decided to discontinue certain product lines which were either unprofitable or provided only a minimal return 
specifically  the company opted to re deploy production assets  which were utilized to produce certain utility slides to the production of the more profitable precision drawer slides

in addition  the emphasis on lean manufacturing continues to identify and eliminate non value added operations from the business  thus  reducing costs 
the improvement in gross profit in fiscal from fiscal reflects the sale of hirsh and the discontinuance of other low margin product lines  which resulted in a more favorable product mix 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company started to realize some of the benefits from the implementation of lean manufacturing techniques  which not only resulted in reduced manufacturing costs  but also allowed the company to improve its service to its customers
