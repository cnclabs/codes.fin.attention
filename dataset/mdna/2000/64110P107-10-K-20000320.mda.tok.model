item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data appearing in item of this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing under item of this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements  as described under forward looking statements and industry data under item of this report 
overview we are a leading provider of software and services for managing and controlling user access to web based e commerce applications 
we introduced our flagship product  siteminder  with the first commercial release of siteminder in november in june  we began shipment of siteminder  the first commercially available directory enabled secure user management solution for web based e commerce applications 
we changed our fiscal year end from march to december  effective with the fiscal period ending december  we derive our revenues from the sale of siteminder software and services and from revenues related to the resale of check point software technologies firewall software product 
siteminder software revenues are derived from the sale of siteminder product licenses 
siteminder service revenues are derived from fees related to the implementation and maintenance of siteminder and training on the siteminder product 
other revenues are derived from the resale  through a dedicated sales organization  of firewall  complementary products from other vendors and related maintenance  consulting and training services 
siteminder software revenues accounted for of total revenues in the year ended december  and of total revenues in the year ended december  siteminder services revenues accounted for of total revenues in the year ended december  and of total revenues in the year ended december  other revenues accounted for of total revenues in the year ended december  and of total revenues in the year ended december  we expect siteminder software and services revenues to increase as a percentage of total revenues 
we currently sell our siteminder products through a combination of our direct sales force  worldwide resellers and licensees 
we anticipate that the percentage of our revenues derived outside of north america will increase 
increasing our international sales may subject us to risks  many of which are outside our control  including economic uncertainties  currency fluctuations  political instability and uncertain cultural and regulatory environments 
our cost of sales includes  among other things  royalties due to third parties for technology included in our products  product fulfillment costs  and salaries and related expenses for our consulting  education and technical support services organizations  and the associated cost of training facilities 
our operating expenses are classified into two general categories selling  general and administrative and research and development 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for selling  administrative and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  legal and accounting services  public relations  marketing materials  trade shows and certain facilities related expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development 
since  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our research and development  sales  marketing and professional services departments  and to establish an administrative organization 
we have incurred net losses in each fiscal quarter since and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in future quarters as we increase sales and marketing operations  expand distribution channels  increase research and development  broaden professional services  expand facilities and support  and improve operational and financial systems 
accordingly  we expect to incur additional losses through at least although we have experienced significant growth in revenues in recent periods  that growth has been from a relatively small base  and there can be no assurance that those growth rates are sustainable 
therefore  historical growth rates should not be considered indicative of future operating results 
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase our revenues or attain profitability or  if increases in revenue and profitability are achieved  that they can be sustained 
we believe that the period to period comparisons of our historical operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance

for the years ended december  and we had no provision for income taxes due to the net losses incurred 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million available for federal purposes to reduce future taxable income expiring on various dates through provisions of the internal revenue code may limit the net operating loss available for use in any given year  based upon significant past or future changes of our ownership

research and development costs 
research and development costs increased by  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  interest income expense  net 
net interest income decreased  or  to  in the year ended december   from  in the year ended december  this decrease was mainly attributable to a lower average cash balance in liquidity and capital resources in recent years  we have funded our operations primarily from sales of securities 
cash used for operating activities in the year ended december  was million  primarily due to a net loss of million and an increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
cash used for investing activities was million in the year ended december  investing activities for the period consisted primarily of the purchases of equipment  consisting largely of office furniture and equipment  telephone and computer equipment 
cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was approximately million  primarily as a result of the sale of  shares of common stock at a price of per share in a follow on public offering on november  on december  the company sold an additional  shares of common stock at a price of per share pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter overallotment option 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from this follow on offering 
in addition  we received net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of common stock at a price of per share to certain investors in a private placement on september  and net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of common stock to certain investors from a private placement on february  as of december   our primary financial commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
in recent years  we have significantly increased our operating expenses 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience significant growth in our operating expenses for the foreseeable future and that our operating expenses and capital expenditures will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in businesses  technologies  products or services that are complementary to our business 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
the statement requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities  with the instruments measured at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value  gains or losses  depends on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation 
the statement initially was to be effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas defers the implementation of sfas by one year 
sfas  as amended by sfas  is effective for our fiscal quarters beginning after january  we do not expect our adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the accounting standards executive committee  or acsec  issued sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
sop amends sop to require that an entity recognize revenue for multiple element arrangements by means of the residual method when there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of all the undelivered elements that are not accounted for by means of long term contract accounting and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements 
we do not expect sop to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
this bulletin summarizes certain views of the staff on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company is currently determining the impact that sab will have on our financial position or results of operations 
year update we have not experienced any disruptions related to the year issue 
nevertheless  we are continuing to evaluate risks associated with a potential delayed impact of year related failures 
any such failure could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  normal business activities which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year issue  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party vendors  we are unable to predict whether any future failure related to the year issue will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
we believe that our efforts to identify and resolve issues related to the year problem have reduced  but not eliminated  the possibility that we will in the future encounter any significant interruptions to normal operations related to the year issue
