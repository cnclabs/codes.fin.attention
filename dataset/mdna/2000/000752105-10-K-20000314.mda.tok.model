in addition  a number of the company s facilities close for regularly scheduled maintenance in the late summer and late december  which tends to reduce operating results during the first half of the company s fiscal year 
transit industry practice with respect to specialty trackwork generally involves the periodic shipment of large quantities  which may be unevenly distributed throughout the year

while the standard  as amended  must be adopted in the fiscal year beginning after june   its impact on the company s consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material as the company has not historically used derivative and hedge instruments
