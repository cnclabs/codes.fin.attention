during  income from unicover s operations totaled million  net of tax expense of million 
effective april   the company completed the disposition of unicover  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources general 
the company had approximately million of financial resources available at the holding company level at december   which was primarily comprised of investments in the common stock of its investment subsidiaries and fixed maturity securities 
the assets of these investment subsidiaries are primarily invested in fixed maturity securities  balances with independent investment managers and marketable securities 
substantially all of the amounts invested with independent investment managers are withdrawable at least annually  subject to applicable notice requirements 
a shelf registration is also in effect under which up to million in securities may be issued by the company 
other sources of liquidity at the holding company level include dividends paid from subsidiaries  primarily generated from operating cash flows and investments  and borrowings available under the credit agreement 
during  rslic will be permitted  without prior regulatory approval  to make dividend payments of million 
in addition  sncc will be permitted  without regulatory or other approval  to make dividend payments of million in additional dividends may also be paid by rslic and sncc with the requisite approvals 
see business regulation 
in general  dividends from the company s non insurance subsidiaries are not subject to regulatory or other restrictions 
as of december   the company had million of borrowings available to it under the credit agreement 
the company s current liquidity needs  in addition to funding operating expenses  include principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement  the senior notes  the sig senior notes and the subordinated notes and distributions on the capital securities 
the maximum amount of borrowings available under the credit agreement will be reduced to the following amounts in october of each year million  million and million 
at the company s current level of borrowings  a principal repayment of million will be required under the credit agreement in october the senior notes mature in their entirety in october and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements nor are they redeemable prior to maturity 
the sig senior notes mature in million annual installments  with the next installment payable in may  and the subordinated notes mature in their entirety in june the junior subordinated debentures underlying the capital securities are not redeemable prior to march  see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
the company from time to time engages in discussions with respect to acquiring blocks of business and insurance and financial services companies  any of which could  if consummated  be material to the company s operations 
sources of liquidity available to the company on a parent company only basis  including the undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries and additional borrowings available under the credit agreement  are expected to exceed the company s current and long term cash requirements 
the principal liquidity requirements of the company s insurance subsidiaries are their contractual obligations to policyholders 
the primary sources of funding for these obligations  in addition to operating earnings  are the marketable investments included in the investment portfolios of these subsidiaries 
the company believes that these sources of funding will be adequate for its insurance subsidiaries to satisfy on both a short term and long term basis these contractual obligations throughout their estimated or stated period 
cash flows 
operating activities increased cash and cash equivalents by million in as compared with an increase of million in  excluding the effect of the cession of million of policy liabilities to oracle re in and the recapture of million of these liabilities in see note o to the consolidated financial statements 
operating cash flows in include million from a reinsurance transaction that was rescinded 
these funds were returned to the ceding company in january also contributing to the increase in operating cash flows in was a decrease in federal income taxes paid principally due to timing differences in recognizing income from investing activities 
net investing activities provided million of cash during primarily from sales of securities  and financing activities used million of cash principally due to a reduction in securities lending and reverse repurchase agreement liabilities 
investments 
the company s overall investment strategy to achieve its objectives of safety and liquidity  while seeking the best available return  focuses on  among other things  managing the durations of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities and minimizing the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s investment portfolio primarily consists of investments in fixed maturity securities  cash and short term investments 
the weighted average credit rating of the company s fixed maturity portfolio as rated by standard poor s corporation was aa at december  while the investment grade rating of the company s fixed maturity portfolio addresses credit risk  it does not address other risks  such as prepayment and extension risks  which are discussed below 
during the year ended december   the company reduced its investments in mortgage backed securities to of total invested assets or million  from of total invested assets  or million  at december  approximately of the company s mortgage backed securities are guaranteed by us government sponsored entities as to the full amount of principal and interest and the remaining consists of investments in trusts created by banks and finance and mortgage companies 
ninety four percent of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio  based on fair values  has been rated as investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
mortgage backed securities subject the company to a degree of interest rate risk  including prepayment and extension risk  which is generally a function of the sensitivity of each security s underlying collateral to prepayments under varying interest rate environments and the repayment priority of the securities in the particular securitization structure 
the company seeks to limit the extent of this risk by emphasizing the more predictable payment classes and securities with stable collateral 
the company maintains an investment program in which securities were financed using advances from the fhlb 
the company has utilized this program to manage the duration of its liabilities and to earn spread income  which is the difference between the financing cost and the earnings from the securities purchased with those funds 
at december   the company had outstanding advances of million that do not begin to mature until in addition  the company utilizes reverse repurchase agreements  futures and option contracts and interest rate swap contracts from time to time in connection with its investment strategy 
these transactions require the company to maintain securities or cash on deposit with the applicable counterparty as collateral 
as the market value of the collateral or contracts changes  the company may be required to deposit additional collateral or be entitled to have a portion of the collateral returned to it 
the company also maintains a securities lending program under which certain securities from its portfolio are loaned to other institutions for short periods of time 
the collateral received for securities loaned is recorded at the fair value of the collateral  which is generally in an amount in excess of the market value of the securities loaned 
the company monitors the market value of the securities loaned and obtains additional collateral as necessary 
the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to make investments is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of their respective state of domicile 
each of these states has comprehensive investment regulations 
in addition  the credit agreement and  as to sncc  the sig senior notes also contain limitations  with which the company is currently in compliance in all material respects  on the composition of the company s investment portfolio 
the company also continually monitors its investment portfolio and attempts to ensure that the risks associated with concentrations of investments in either a particular sector of the market or a single entity are limited 
asset liability management and market risk 
because the company s primary assets and liabilities are financial in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by active portfolio management focusing on matching the durations of invested assets and related liabilities to minimize the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and by the adjustment of the crediting rate on annuity products 
in addition  the company  at times  utilizes exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce the risk associated with changes in the value of its fixed maturity portfolio due to changes in the interest rate environment and to reduce the risk associated with changes in interest rates in connection with anticipated securities purchases 
generally  market prices of fixed maturity securities decline in an environment of increasing interest rates in a manner similar to that of us treasury securities 
therefore  in order to reduce the extent of this interest rate risk  the company enters into option contracts and short us treasury futures  the value of which will rise in such an environment 
at december   the company had realized gains of million on closed positions and unrealized gains of million on open positions related to this program that have been deferred and recorded as adjustments to the amortized cost of the fixed maturity securities being hedged 
the company periodically analyzes the results of its asset liability matching through cash flow analysis and duration matching under multiple interest rate scenarios 
these analyses enable the company to measure the potential gain or loss in fair value of its interest rate sensitive financial instruments due to hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based on these analyses  if interest rates were to immediately increase by from their year end levels  the fair value of the company s interest sensitive assets  net of corresponding changes in the fair value of cost of business acquired and insurance and investment related liabilities  would decline by approximately million at december  as compared to a decline of approximately million at december  these analyses incorporate numerous assumptions and estimates and assume no changes in the composition of the company s investment portfolio in reaction to such interest rate changes 
consequently  the results of this analysis will likely be different from the actual changes experienced under given interest rate scenarios  and those differences may be material 
a portion of the company s trading account portfolio consists of equity securities which are subject to risks resulting from  among other things  changes in the level of equity prices 
to reduce the extent of this risk  the company has entered into corresponding short positions relating to certain of these securities 
if the fair value of the company s trading account securities were to decrease by from their year end levels  the fair value of these securities  net of the corresponding change in the fair value of the related short positions  would decrease by approximately million at december  as compared to a decline of approximately million at december  the company manages the composition of its borrowed capital by considering factors such as the ratio of borrowed capital to total capital  future debt requirements  the interest rate environment and other market conditions 
approximately of the company s corporate debt was issued at fixed interest rates 
a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates would cause a corresponding million increase in the fair value of the company s fixed rate corporate debt at december  as compared to an increase of million at december  because interest expense on the company s floating rate corporate debt fluctuates as prevailing interest rates change  changes in market interest rates would not materially affect its fair value 
impact of year the year issue relates to whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information in years subsequent to prior to  the company underwent a corporate wide program to address the year issue  as it relates to its own computer systems  as well as to instances in which computer systems of third parties may have a significant impact on the company s operations  such as those of suppliers  business partners  customers  facilities and telecommunications 
since  the company has incurred million of costs to address the year issue  of which million was expensed and million was capitalized 
the company does not anticipate incurring any material additional costs related to the year issue 
the company has not experienced any significant disruptions of business operations related to the year issue to date and believes that the risk of any such disruption in the future is low  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
it is possible that year problems that are not currently apparent may arise in the future 
accordingly  the company will continue to monitor its systems for year compliance
