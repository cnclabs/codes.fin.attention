overview we began operations in january to develop  market and support enterprise software for application integration 
in and  our company was in the development stage and was principally focused on product development and assembling its management team and infrastructure 
software license revenues were not significant until the commercial release of our neonet software in january since such time  a substantial portion of our revenues has been attributable to licenses of neonet and related services 
in november  we commenced shipment to customers of release of neonet  which provided additional capabilities for effective enterprise wide application integration 
in december  we entered into a license agreement with ibm for the joint development of a product designed to integrate ibm s mqseries product with certain of our products 
under the terms of the agreement  both neon and ibm began selling the resulting mqintegrator or mqseries integrator products 
in june  we completed our initial public offering and issued  shares of common stock  and received net proceeds of approximately million 
in may and december  we completed follow on offerings and issued  and  shares of our common stock  respectively  and received net proceeds of approximately million and million  respectively 
recent acquisitions in june  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of microscript  inc microscript for an aggregate purchase price of million  of which million was paid or payable in cash and approximately million was paid through the issuance of  shares of common stock 
an additional  shares of common stock valued at million was issued to the shareholders of microscript upon the completion of the microscript audited financial statements for the year ended december  in july  we agreed with the former equityholders of microscript to provide additional cash consideration valued at approximately million to more closely reflect the value agreed upon in the original purchase negotiations 
microscript is a supplier of application integration software on the windows nt platform 
also in june  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of convoy corporation convoy for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  payable through the issuance of  shares of common stock

sli is a worldwide provider of sap r software implementation  training support and other related change management services 
in april  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of vie systems  inc vie for an aggregate consideration of million in cash 
in addition  up to million of cash may be paid to the shareholders of vie upon the achievement of certain performance targets 
assets acquired by the company included vie s products  including its copernicus eai product and formatter patent 
vie is a provider of eai software with a strong presence in travel  transportation  financial services  and retail markets 
in february  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of d m asia ltd 
and database management s pte 
ltd 
collectively d m  a professional integration service provider on the pacific rim  for an aggregate consideration of approximately million  million in cash and approximately million through the issuance of  shares of common stock 
all of these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
results of operations for fiscal years ended december   and revenues our revenues increased from million in to million in  primarily reflecting growth in software licenses sold to new customers and an increase in sales as a result of our international expansion 
revenues increased from million in to million in  resulting primarily from increased professional services and maintenance revenues associated with the expansion of our professional services organization through both internal growth and acquisitions  as well as continued growth in software licenses sold 
software license revenue grew from million in to million  or of total revenues  in and to million  or of total revenues  in the increase in software license revenue reflected an increase in market awareness and acceptance of our products  expansion of international sales resources  the continued growth of an installed base of accounts to serve as references for new customers  repeat business by existing customers  and expanded functionality of the neonet suite of products 
our royalties from sales of mqintegrator and mqseries integrator by ibm were between and of software license revenue in and this royalty income increased in absolute dollars in compared with  even though neon s revenue excluded royalties earned on fourth quarter ibm sales of the mqintegrator and mqseries integrator products 
this one quarter lag in the recording of ibm royalty revenue was necessary to accommodate ibm s royalty reporting schedule  which could no longer support current quarter royalty reporting 
in the second quarter of  we began selling the mqseries integrator product through an ibm reseller arrangement known as passport advantage 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 only the net reseller margin is recorded as license revenue 
although neon earns royalty revenue for these sales  it is recognized on a one quarter lag as noted above 
we expect that future software license revenue will include the neon e biz platforms and applications  and new products both internally developed and acquired 
software maintenance revenue grew from  or less than of total revenues in  to million or of total revenues in  to million or of total revenues in the increase in maintenance revenue is due primarily to maintenance sales to new customers and maintenance renewals on license contracts historically sold by companies acquired by neon during through  most notably cai 
professional services revenue grew from million or of total revenues in  to million or of total revenues in  to million or of total revenues in the growth from to was due primarily to the acquisition of two professional service organizations sli and d m in the first half of the growth from to reflected service engagements associated with the growing sales of the neonet product 
in  and  our top ten customers accounted for  and of total revenues  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  our largest customer accounted for  and of total revenues  respectively 
to date  a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from sales to large banks and financial institutions 
for the years ended december   and  sales to banks and financial institutions accounted for  and of total revenues  respectively 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of costs of software licenses and costs of services and maintenance 
as a percentage of total revenues  total cost of revenues declined from in  to in  and then increased to in the decline from to resulted primarily from improved service margins 
cost of revenues increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in  due primarily to the increase in percentage of professional services revenue to total revenues 
cost of software licenses consists primarily of royalty payments and costs of producing cd s and packaging 
in the fourth quarter of  we met the cumulative million royalty requirement to merrill lynch co 
for neon s sale of the neonet product 
with the roll out of the jointly developed mqintegrator and mqseries integrator products  we became obligated to pay royalties to ibm for sales of these products made by our direct sales force 
during  this royalty obligation was not material as most sales of mqseries integrator and mqintegrator had been made by ibm or an ibm distributor 
cost of services and maintenance consists primarily of personnel  facility  and systems costs incurred in providing professional services consulting  training  and customer support services 
as a percent of services and maintenance revenues  cost of services and maintenance was  and in  and  respectively 
the higher percentage cost in and reflected the use  at higher cost  of subcontract labor on certain engagements 
in the third quarter of  management reevaluated the current use of contract labor and replaced it with employee labor wherever possible 
we may continue to use subcontractors for the delivery of professional services from time to time 
operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries for sales and marketing personnel  commissions  travel and entertainment  and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million  representing  and of total revenues  respectively  in  and these increases were due primarily to our expansion of overall sales and marketing resources and infrastructure  including international expansion in our commissioned sales force grew from in  to in and to in in addition  we continued to expand the sales team responsible for supporting indirect channel sales 
we expect to continue to expand the direct sales force and professional marketing staff  further increase our international presence  and continue to develop our indirect sales channels and increase promotional activity 
accordingly  we expect sales and marketing expense to continue to grow in absolute dollars 
research and development research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements of existing products and quality assurance activities 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries  consultant costs and benefits 
we have not capitalized software development costs and have expensed all of these costs as incurred in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million  representing  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to hiring additional technical personnel engaged in software development activities 
our research and development staff grew from in  to in and in we currently anticipate that research and development expenses may continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to commit substantial resources to new product development 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs  outside professional fees  and software and equipment costs associated with the finance  legal  human resources  and administrative functions 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  representing  and of total revenues  respectively  in  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses grew in absolute dollars as we added personnel to all administrative areas 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to grow in absolute dollars from expected increases in personnel  implementation of additional management information systems associated with our business growth  and continuation of our international expansion 
restructuring costs management and the board of directors approved a restructuring plan in july to consolidate duplicate facilities and eliminate redundant positions created by recent acquisitions 
the restructuring charge in of million includes million of employee separation benefits related to the termination of approximately employees worldwide 
the separations have affected all business functions  job classifications and geographic areas with most of the reductions in north america and europe 
the charge also includes approximately million of costs for closing and consolidation of office space primarily in north america and europe 
the restructuring efforts are expected to be complete by june acquisition related charges in july and august  we agreed with the former equityholders of microscript and convoy  respectively  to provide additional consideration to more closely reflect the value agreed upon in the original purchase negotiations 
accordingly  approximately million in cash was paid to the former equityholders of microscript and  shares of our common stock valued at million was issued to the former convoy equityholders 
these acquisition charges were reflected in our financial statements for the third quarter of as a one time charge to net income 
based on independent appraisals of net assets acquired  million and million were allocated to in process research and development and charged to expense in for the cai and msb acquisitions  respectively 
in  million was allocated to in process research and development projects and was charged to operations in connection with the acquisition of menhir in september also in connection with these acquisitions  we allocated approximately million to marketable software products acquired which is being amortized over periods of three to five years  and approximately million to goodwill which is being amortized over periods of seven to ten years 
amortization expense of approximately  million and million was recorded in  and  respectively 
see in process research and development costs below 
other income  net other income  net includes interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities  notes receivable related party  interest expense  foreign currency gains and losses  and other nonoperating income and expenses 
we recorded net other income of million in this compares to net other income of million in and  in the increase in net other income from to and again from to resulted primarily from the interest earned on cash invested from the proceeds of our public offering in june and our follow on offerings in may and december during  we funded a short term construction loan to greenwood plaza partners  llp for approximately million toward construction of two buildings and a parking structure 
for  we recorded  of interest income earned on this note 
we anticipate interest income will decline in future periods as cash balances may be used to fund potential future acquisitions and our ongoing operations 
income tax benefit we reported no income tax expense in we recognized income tax benefits of million in and million in the benefit for was approximately of our pretax loss from operations 
the effective rate varied from the statutory rate principally because of non deductible charges and amortization related to business acquisitions 
our deferred tax assets at december  of million were fully offset by a valuation allowance 
during our deferred tax assets increased by million to approximately million primarily due to intangibles we acquired from cai that were expensed  but which we amortize over years for tax purposes  and additions to our tax credit carryovers 
we concluded in that it was more likely than not that we would recognize million of our deferred tax assets  and we adjusted the valuation allowance to million 
during our deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  increased by approximately million to million 
the increase was primarily from operating loss carryforwards  including tax deductions arising from the exercise of stock options  shorter amortization lives for purchased intangible than allowed for tax purposes  acquired operating loss carryovers  and increased tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities of approximately million were also recognized for purchased intangibles  other than goodwill  that have no tax basis 
we increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets from million at december   to approximately million 
a portion of the valuation allowance  million relates to tax loss carryforwards of purchased businesses 
if these deferred tax assets are realized  the benefit will reduce goodwill arising from the convoy and microscript acquisitions 
an additional portion of the allowance  million relates to stock option compensation deductions included in our net operating loss carryforwards 
if and when we determine to reverse that portion of the valuation allowance  the benefit will be added to paid in capital  rather than being shown as a reduction of future income tax expense 
net loss we reported a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the loss includes acquisition related and restructuring charges of million and million  respectively 
excluding these charges  related tax benefits and a nonrecurring adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  we generated a net loss of approximately million  or per share 
our net loss for was million  or per share 
the loss includes acquisition related charges of million for in process research and development and amortization of acquired intangibles 
excluding these charges and the related estimated tax benefit  we generated net income of approximately million  or per share  based on  diluted weighted average shares outstanding 
giving effect to expenses associated with the menhir acquisition  the company reported a net loss of million  or per share  in excluding the million charge for acquired in process research and development and amortization of acquired intangibles  the net loss was approximately  or per common share 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments in marketable securities  compared with million at december  this decrease was primarily due to cash paid for acquisitions  and cash used for operations  including acquisition related charges and restructuring expenses 
no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit during the years ended december  or we had working capital of million and million at december  and  respectively 
included in determining such amounts are short term deferred revenue and customer deposits of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of short term deferred revenue represents annual maintenance fees charged to customers  which is recognized ratably as revenue over the support service contract period 
we used million in cash for operating activities during the year ended december  compared to million in cash during the year ended december  the decrease in operating cash flow was due primarily to the net loss from operations for the year ended december  as adjusted to eliminate the effect of noncash charges and benefits  this net loss was million 
cash payments for acquisition charges of approximately million and cash paid for restructuring charges of approximately million had a significant impact on cash used for operations 
our accounts receivable  net  increased to million at december  compared to million at december  of the million increase in accounts receivable  net  million of the increase was due to acquisitions which occurred in the first two quarters of as required by purchase accounting  our accounts receivable balance includes each of the acquired entity s respective accounts receivable balances while sales are included only from the effective date of the acquisition 
we used million in cash for investing activities for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  in both periods  one of the primary investing activities was the net purchase of short term and long term marketable securities 
the increase from the prior year was primarily due to the investment of the remaining proceeds from follow on offerings during the first two quarters of in the year ended december   we continued to invest cash in business combinations 
the most significant cash outlays for acquisitions resulted from the vie  sli and microscript acquisitions with net cash investments of million  million and million  respectively 
during both and  we purchased furniture  fixtures and equipment necessary to support our expanding operations 
during  we funded approximately million in a short term construction loan to greenwood plaza partners  llp gpp for construction of two buildings and a parking structure 
gpp is principally owned by the company s chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
during the third quarter of  the company began leasing the completed portion of the buildings from gpp for use as its principal corporate headquarters 
we replaced an existing lender for the first phase of construction  and have committed to fund up to million for one year at a floating interest rate of day libor plus 
during construction  gpp intends to obtain permanent financing from a third party lender 
the terms of the construction financing are consistent with those that were in place with gpp s previous lender and have been approved by our board of directors 
financing activities provided million in cash during compared to million during for the period  this cash was from exercises of common stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
in  we received million in net proceeds from our may and december follow on offerings and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  warrants and the employee stock purchase plan 
in august  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to of neon s outstanding shares of common stock over a month period 
as of march  we have repurchased  shares at a total cost of approximately  the company may purchase additional shares from time to time on the open market 
in july  we agreed with the former equityholders of microscript to pay additional purchase consideration to more closely reflect the purchase value agreed upon in the purchase negotiations 
this required additional cash expenditures of million in the third quarter of we believe our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
thereafter  we may require additional sources of funds to continue to support our business 
there can be no assurance that such capital  if needed  will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to us 
foreign currency risk we operate wholly owned subsidiaries located in england  france  switzerland  germany  australia  japan  malaysia  hong kong and singapore 
sales and expenses from these operations are typically denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in foreign exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
we do not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows and  therefore  have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments 
there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of foreign exchange rates relative to the united states dollar

recently issued accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas 
sfas was to be effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards of derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
in july  sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective data of fasb statement no 
sfas was issued 
sfas deferred the effective date until fiscal years beginning after june  we have not engaged in hedging activities or invested in derivative instruments 
year readiness many currently installed computer systems and software products were coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these code fields needed to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates  and the failure to do so could result in the loss of revenues 
all of our hardware and software systems successfully transitioned to the year we have not experienced any significant problems as a result of year problems with our own systems or those of our vendors 
however  the potential still exists for a noncompliant system  either within neon or at a vendor  to malfunction due to the year issue and cause a disruption to our business 
due to the uncertain nature of this issue  we can not determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that  with the successful transition to the year  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be minimal 
in process research and development during  we acquired century analysis  inc cai  and msb consultants msb 
we continued to incur research and development expenses in on in process research and development ipr d projects acquired from these two companies 
detailed descriptions of these projects were included in our k for the year ended december   specific activities for follow 
as of the date of the cai acquisition  cai had invested million in the ipr d identified in our k 
we estimated an additional million would be required over the to months following the acquisition to develop the products to commercial viability 
we have continued to invest additional r d dollars in the acquired ipr d projects 
in  we expended approximately one hundred ninety man months on the acquired cai projects in total 
we are contemplating various strategies with respect to the continued development of the ipr d projects 
significant achievements have been accomplished as of the valuation date on the ipr d projects  such as the development of frameworks for design and coding  and construction of the various codes and surrounding architectures 
we continue to make progress in these areas  among others 
on december   we projected the remaining costs required to complete the next generation impact tdm project would be approximately million  should this project be completed as anticipated on the acquisition date 
in  we spent approximately  toward the further development of impact tdm 
the next generation impact tdm project has been incorporated into our neon common architecture r d strategy  and the continued development and remaining costs for completion are being incorporated into this global architecture strategy 
we estimate the total cost for the impact tdm project within our global architecture to be approximately the same as initially projected 
cai had expended a total of approximately million on component related projects prior to the closing of its acquisition by neon 
for these projects to reach technological feasibility  additional efforts were projected to cost approximately  in  neon spent roughly  toward these component related projects 
portions of cai s component related technology have been incorporated into neon s products 
additional components will be further rolled into neon product releases in the year cai had expended approximately million on other enterprise technology solutions as of september for these projects to reach technological feasibility  we projected that additional progress would need to be accomplished in a timely manner and would cost approximately million 
we continue to spend heavily on these projects and at this time  significant additional achievements have been made 
specifically  we spent roughly  towards the development of xml and corba technology in xml technology was released in the third quarter of and further enhancements will be made into the first part of corba technology is being developed into a stand alone adapter product  which is currently scheduled to be released in q msb was working on price server with new capabilities  arte designed for a windows nt environment  and quantum leap on the date of acquisition 
these projects are particularly complex due to the modular nature of msb s products and technology 
as of the date of acquisition  msb had invested million in the ipr d identified above 
we estimated an additional  would be required over the to months following the acquisition to develop the aforementioned products to commercial viability 
we continued to invest r d dollars in the acquired ipr d projects during as of the end of  all the projects are finished and have been fully incorporated into neon s product development 
the timeline and expectations for completion of these projects did not differ materially from what was anticipated at the time of the purchase and the projects were released as planned 
the revenue and costs associated with these projects did not materially differ from the initial valuation 
we believe the work performed as of the valuation date had encompassed many of the critical elements needed to complete the price server project 
we estimated approximately  in development costs was incurred as of the acquisition date and approximately  was required to complete the remaining development tasks 
we spent roughly  in on this project 
the pricing module for banking applications became available during the first half of the price server project is complete and has been incorporated into the neon product infrastructure 
in order to achieve milestones for the arte project  we estimate msb had invested approximately  on this project as of june remaining r d expenditures were estimated to be approximately  in order to complete this project 
we spent about  in on this project 
arte s functionality was incorporated into a neon product introduced in mid it was estimated  had been incurred as of the acquisition date for the quantum leap project and approximately  would be required to complete the product 
we spent roughly  in on this project 
the first version of this product was released in the fourth quarter of  and further development efforts were made throughout to incorporate quantum leap technology into another product released in the second half of we do not break down revenues attributable specifically to cai and msb derived products 
as products are offered both as a suite and as individual applications  neon license fees are not necessarily application specific 
however  we believe overall revenues generated to date concur with the assumptions used in the valuation analysis 
within the msb product line  the product revenue we expect during from the products sold on a stand alone version  as well as the product suite incorporating the technology  is substantially the same as initially forecasted in the valuation study 
we believe the total forecast  for this product as well as the other cai projects  remains substantially the same as in the valuation study over the remaining life of the products 
we currently believe expenses associated with completing the purchased in process research and development are consistent with the estimates used in the valuation 
in addition  completion dates for the development projects discussed above remain consistent with projections used at the time of the acquisition and are consistent with the numbers presented in this analysis 
the only change was that corba is scheduled to be released one quarter after our initial estimate 
research and development spending with respect to these offerings is expected to continue at a rate that is consistent with our overall research and development spending 
we do not believe that the acquisitions resulted in any material changes in our profit margins or in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we do not believe we achieved any material expense reductions or synergies as a result of the acquisition 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were consistent with the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects 
discount rates of and for cai and and for msb were deemed appropriate for the business enterprises and for the acquired completed in process research and development  respectively 
these discount rates were consistent with the acquired companies various stages of development  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty at the time of the acquisition surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and the inherent uncertainties of the technological advances that were indeterminable at the time of the acquisition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of operations  our financial position and cash flows are subject to a variety of risks  which include market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and movements in interest rates 
we do not  in the normal course of business  use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political  economic  tax  other regulatory or credit risks are not included in the following assessment of our market risks 
foreign currency exchange rates operations outside of the us expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes and could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
during  of our total revenue was generated from our international operations  and the net assets of our foreign subsidiaries totaled of consolidated net assets as of december  our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which we conduct business 
we operate outside the us primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in england  france  switzerland  australia  germany  japan  malaysia  hong kong and singapore 
these foreign subsidiaries use local currencies as their functional currency  as sales are generated and expenses are incurred in such currencies 
foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our operations as compared to the us dollar  and future operating results will be affected to some extent by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure 
we do not believe that possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on our future earnings or cash flows and  therefore  have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments 
there can be no assurance that such approach will be successful  especially in the event of a sudden and significant decline in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies 
interest rates our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments in marketable securities and our related party note receivable 
our investments  including cash equivalents  consist of us  state and municipal bonds  as well as domestic corporate bonds  with maturities of greater than months 
all short term investments are classified as available for sale as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and accordingly are carried at market value 
our short term investment objectives are safety  liquidity and yield 
additionally  interest income on our related party receivable is based on a floating interest rate of day libor plus 
changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income or could impact the fair market value of our investments 
however  we believe these changes in interest rates will not cause a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
