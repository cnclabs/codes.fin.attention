the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company is based on the financial statements and the notes thereto included herein 
a and b liquidity and capital resources twelve months ended november  the company s main source of funds was a reduction in accounts receivable and inventories 
the accounts receivable decrease results primarily from the lower sales volume 
the decrease in inventories results from the lower sales volume offset partially by the acquisition of new product lines in fiscal year the positive cash flow from operations allowed for the reduction in bank borrowings 
capital expenditures were entirely for production equipment 
twelve months ended november  the company s main source of funds was additional bank borrowings 
the main uses of funds by operating activities were increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
the accounts receivable increase results from a slower payment pattern for our own branded equipment which increased the days outstanding from days to days 
inventory increased due primarily to case tillage equipment production scheduled for december expenditures for capital equipment were  including  to upgrade computer hardware and software 
the balance of the expenditures was spent on production equipment 
six months ended november  for the six months ended november   the company s main source of funds resulted from net income plus depreciation 
this source was offset by an increase in inventories and a decrease in customer deposits 
the inventory increase resulted from a higher production load at november  due primarily from case tillage equipment 
customer deposits were from down payments on beet equipment 
this equipment was shipped during the six month period  consequently the decrease in customer deposits 
twelve months ended may  cash used by operations of  resulted from an increase in inventories and receivables  offset in part by increased payables 
in fiscal year  major capital expenditures included two acquisitions 
the first acquisition was a line of potato farming equipment and associated service parts 
the second acquisition was a line of grain wagons and associated service parts 
the acquisitions  which included fixed assets and inventory  were financed by the issuance of  shares of art s way common stock  loans from the state of iowa and local sources obtained through the state of iowa community development block grant program and borrowings under the company s short term line of credit 
capital resources in april  the company amended its revolving line of credit agreement which also includes provisions related to the installment promissory note 
the agreement allows for borrowings up to  based upon a percentage of the company s accounts receivable and inventory and allows for letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of  at november  the company has borrowed  and has  in outstanding letters of credit 
the interest rate is based on the bank s referenced rate and is variable based upon certain performance objectives with a maximum of plus of the referenced rate and a minimum of plus zero at november

the lender has notified the company via letter dated october   that the current loan agreeement provides that the lender may  as a result of any event of default  accelerate the payment of all obligations 
the lender has not called for this acceleration  but has the right to do so at any time 
the lender has assessed an additional interest factor to its credit facility 
during  the company was notified by its lender that the company does not fit the lender s customer profile and was requested to relocate its financing needs 
the company has continued to represent to the lender that they are in the process of obtaining alternate financing 
as a result  the lender has not accelerated the payment of all obligations at this time  even though the lender has the right to do so 
as a result  all long term borrowing associated with this lender has been classified as current 
the company is currently negotiating with another financial institution in order to establish a new credit facility 
the company anticipates that this new credit facility will be finalized during the second quarter of fiscal year all loans  advances and other obligations  liabilities and indebtedness of the company are secured by all present and future assets

per share compared to a net loss of  
per share in the prior year 
revenues from art s way branded products were down while oem sales decreased 
the art s way reduction in revenue resulted from lower demand for art s way branded products 
the oem reduction in revenue was primarily the result of the company s large oem customer instituting inventory reduction programs due to the distressed agriculture economy 
gross profit percent improved from in to in mainly due to the higher proportion of art s way branded products  which generally carry a higher standard margin  combined with improved manufacturing efficiencies 
operating expenses were down  from the previous year 
lower engineering expenses reflect less new product development costs  lower selling expenses reflect lower level of sales  while lower general and administrative expenses in reflect a significant increase in bad debt reserve in to cover the adverse potato market conditions 
overall  operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased from in to in a lower level of borrowings resulted in lower interest costs 
other expenses decreased  higher costs on the company s program to offer floor plan financing to our larger dealers through a third party was offset by a debt forgiveness on some of the company s edsa loans

the increase in sales revenue was due to our new contract to provide tillage equipment and related service parts to case corporation 
total sales arising from the contract were  the company also benefited from a new agreement with new holland to supply a forage blower similar to that provided to other oem customers 
this major increase in oem business more than offset a decline in demand for the company s branded products 
a collapse in potato prices  low hog prices and a poor farm economy in the red river valley region  all contributed to the decline in demand for the company s branded products 
gross profit decreased from for the twelve months ended november  to for the twelve months ended november  this dramatic change of percentage points results primarily from a change in product mix from oem  art s way brands in to oem  art s way brands in oem business inherently is less profitable 
this product mix impact reduced our gross margin by percentage points 
problems incurred in the start up of the new tillage products due to late vendor delivery of components and absorbing new manufacturing processes resulted in scheduling problems for all products 
this resulted in significant overtime to catch up  with a consequent deterioration in production efficiency 
warranty costs increased  due to startup problems with a new model beet harvester 
operating expenses were up from last year 
the full year impact of the restoration of the company contribution to the employee k plan impacted expenses by  group insurance to cover employee medical costs rose  new product introduction costs were   was spent on outside consultants to determine the cause of our deteriorating manufacturing performance 
bad debt reserves were increased by  to cover the adverse potato market conditions 
overall  operating expenses as a percentage of sales dropped from in to in higher inventory levels throughout the year caused a increase in interest expense 
other financing expenses include an  charge in the fourth quarter to be in compliance with fasb on the accounting treatment for sales of accounts receivable 
six months ended november  sales increased due mainly to strength in sugar beet harvesting equipment and related service parts 
other strong areas included corn stalk shredders  where the company enjoyed its best season since  the supramix vertical feed mixer and our traditional grinder mixer products 
two areas of weakness in sales were the termination of our oem contract to make frames for a local fiberglass body manufacturer and our deliberate scaling back of logan potato equipment production in view of a dramatic downturn in potato prices and customer demand 
gross profits increased due to improved production efficiencies  a product mix of higher margin products and improved purchasing of raw materials 
warranty expenses were impacted adversely by  due to unanticipated problems with our new model beet harvester 
the company encountered learning curve expenses associated with the new tillage production for case 
operating expenses are up as the company added staff in engineering and sales to support our new product lines and to enhance our position in the beet and feed processing business and due to the reinstatement of the company s contribution to the employee k retirement plan 
interest costs were up  as the higher sales volumes required higher working capital requirements 
utilization of deferred tax assets the company has established a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately  at november   due to the uncertainty of realizing various nol and tax credit carryforwards 
there was no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at november  and and may  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets for these years  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the expiration dates of tax credits and carry forwards and projected future taxable income  management believes it is more likely than not the companmy will realize the benefits of the november  net deferred tax assets
