this represents net income loss  adjusted for a pro forma charge in lieu of income taxes for the periods the company was an s corporation as if bindview were a c corporation for all periods 
revenues the company s revenues are derived from the sale of software products and related services including subscription contracts 
total revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing year to year increases of between and and between and we had no customers that accounted for more than of our revenues in  or revenues recognized from sales to customers outside north america  primarily in the united kingdom and europe  represented approximately  and in  and  respectively 
licenses 
license revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increase in the company s license revenues over these periods is a result of continued market acceptance of the bindview ems product family and revenues generated from new product introductions 
no assurances can be made that revenues will continue to increase at the rates reflected 
services 
service revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increase in the company s service revenues over these periods is a result of an increase in purchases and renewals of subscription contracts by the company s growing installed customer base 
because revenues from subscription contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term  this increase in these revenues as a percentage of total revenues results in greater deferred revenue recognition 
the costs associated with these services are recognized as they are incurred 
this may negatively impact the company s operating margins during periods in which the company incurs infrastructure ramp up costs in response to increases in purchases and renewals of subscription contacts 
cost of revenues cost of licenses 
cost of licenses includes product manuals  packaging  distribution and media costs for our software products 
cost of licenses were million   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of license revenues in the respective periods 
the cost of licenses has increased primarily due to increases in product shipments 
the company believes these costs will remain relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue  although there will continue to be quarterly fluctuations due to the timing of certain expenses 
cost of services 
cost of services includes personnel and other costs related to technical support and professional services 
cost of services were million  million and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of service revenues in the respective periods 
the increase in the absolute dollar cost of services is primarily from increases in the cost of technical support staff providing support to the company s growing customer base and increases in the cost of professional services staff providing customer training and implementation services 
the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of service revenues over these periods is primarily due to service revenues outpacing technical support staffing levels as we benefited from greater efficiencies of scale 
we believe services gross margin as a percentage of service revenues in the foreseeable future will remain relatively consistent with services gross margins realized in professional service revenues generally results in a lower gross margin than other types of revenues and in the event that professional service revenues increase as a percentage of total revenues  our overall gross margin may be adversely affected 
costs and expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  general office expenses  travel and entertainment and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increase in the absolute dollar cost of sales and marketing expenses is related to the hiring of additional personnel in connection with the building of the company s sales force and the additional facilities and computer systems required by these additional personnel 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues is related to the reduction of duplicative marketing efforts associated with netect over these periods  the start up costs incurred with the launch of the company s direct telesales organization in germany and france in and the ongoing efforts of the company to manage operating expenses 
as we continue to devote resources to the expansion of our domestic and international sales and marketing organization  bindview expects that the annual sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue to be in the range of for the foreseeable future 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for product development  product management and quality assurance personnel  payments to contract programmers and expendable equipment purchases 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increase in research and development expenses is related to increased personnel  additional facilities and an increase in the computer systems and software development tools required by the additional personnel 
the decline in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue is a result of certain product lines reaching a stage in their product life cycle requiring less research and development effort relative to the respective license revenue generated by these products and the company s ongoing efforts to manage operating expenses 
however  the company believes that a significant research and development investment is essential for it to maintain and grow its market position and continue to expand its product line 
accordingly  the company anticipates it will continue to devote substantial resources to product research and development for the foreseeable future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  personnel and related costs for the company s executive  administrative  finance and information services staff 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increase in the general and administrative expenses is related to increased staffing  facilities costs and associated expenses necessary to manage and support the company s increased scale of operations and the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts over this period 
the decline in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is a result of the reduction of duplicative staff associated with the netect acquisition and the company s ongoing efforts to manage operating expenses combined with the company s revenue growth 
the company expects that for general and administrative expenses will remain relatively constant from as a percentage of total revenue  but increase in absolute dollars 
acquisition related earnout at december   the company was obligated to make an earnout payment of million to certain former owners of curasoft based on the achievement of revenue targets related to an existing product  as well as their continued employment with the company 
the company is not obligated to any other future earnout payments related to this acquisition 
merger and restructuring expenses on march   the company merged with netect  ltd 
netect in a stock for stock transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the transaction costs related to the acquisition include investment banking fees of  accounting and legal expenses of  transfer fees of  and other miscellaneous transaction expenses of  at december  there were no remaining unpaid transaction costs on the company s balance sheet 
at the time of the merger  management approved restructuring plans to eliminate duplicate senior management positions and to close the israeli operations of netect 
the restructuring plans were based on management s best estimate of those costs based on the information available at that time 
the restructuring expenses related to this plan include involuntary employee separation expenses for approximately former netect employees  the costs to close netect s israeli operations and other miscellaneous restructuring expenses 
the restructuring expense adjustment relates to additional costs to close netect s israeli operations that exceeded management s initial estimate 
the company has completed most of the actions related to the restructuring plans 
the company believes the remaining reserve is sufficient to complete the remaining actions under the plan 
the accrued restructuring expenses and amounts charged against the provision as of december   were as follows beginning cash accrued expenses at accrual adjustment expenditures december  in thousands employee severance and related costs israeli office closing other restructuring costs total purchased in process research and development in december  the company committed to deliver  shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding equity interests in curasoft  inc in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
these shares were issued in the first quarter of the purchase price allocation resulted in an immediate write off of approximately million in for purchased in process research and development costs related to a curasoft product curaslam undergoing development at the time of the acquisition 
curaslam has been designed as a stand alone product by curasoft and is not related to the curasoft enr product family 
this product is currently being designed to enable customers to improve the service levels of their computing environments and will help customers better align business processes with their it functions 
this product has been integrated with bindview products 
the company determined that the purchased in process technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use based on the status of design and development activities at the acquisition date 
to determine the fair value of the purchased in process research and development activities  the company utilized values determined by an independent valuation firm  which applied the percentage of completion approach 
prior to the acquisition  curasoft conducted in depth market research  designed the product architecture  substantially completed the coding of the user interface and began the coding of the other modules 
the company has estimated that the development effort of this product was complete at the date of acquisition 
the percentage completed of was applied to the estimated fair value of the completed product to determine the in process research and development charge upon acquisition 
the estimated fair value of the completed product was determined using the future revenue streams expected from the product  net of related expenses  discounted at a rate based upon the specific level of risk associated with achieving the forecasted revenues 
the company estimates that in order for this product to be available for general distribution during the first half of  it will need to invest between and million in development costs associated with its operations in fremont  california 
the company estimates that future revenues related to this product will be between million and million between and the management of the company has conducted due diligence and performed an assessment of remaining tasks and risks to achieve completion 
the development activities required to complete the acquired in process technologies include additional design  coding  quality assurance procedures and customer beta testing 
the challenges facing the company to complete the development of this product on schedule include the management of a development office away from its principle offices in houston  texas  the ability to adequately staff this office  the ability to effectively integrate the product with the company s existing products and the validation of the product and its features by potential customers 
if the development of the product is delayed  this could adversely impact its availability date and time to market and therefore  its ability to market the product 
if the product is available for general distribution during the first half of  the company anticipates generating material net cash inflows from this product in stock compensation expense stock compensation expense was million for million of such expense resulted from the issuance of million shares of common stock in connection with the termination of our phantom stock plan and  of such expense resulted from the issuance of a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock to an officer in exchange for extinguishing a bonus provision in his employment agreement 
other income  net the company had other income of million  million and  in fiscal  and this increase is primarily due to an increase in interest income related to higher cash  cash equivalents and investment balances as a result of the proceeds from company s initial public offering in july  the secondary offering in december and positive cash flow from operating activities 
provision for income taxes prior to october   bindview was treated as a subchapter s corporation for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  no federal income tax expense was recorded for the period january  to october  the taxable income generated from results of operations during this period was reported in the income tax returns of the individual shareholders 
a pro forma charge in lieu of income taxes has been recognized in the consolidated statement of operations to reflect income taxes as if the company had been a c corporation for all periods 
historical restated results of the company related to the acquisition of netect in march  do not recognize a tax benefit for certain net operating losses generated by netect because the company s ability to realize the net operating losses is limited by the former structure of netect and by the company s plans for netect s future operations 
the effective tax rate was in and in valuation allowances booked on foreign net operating losses adversely impacted both and s rates 
certain transaction expenses recorded in connection with the company s merger with netect are not deductible for federal income tax purposes and adversely impacted the rate 
purchased in process research and development expenses recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of curasoft  inc are not deductible for federal income tax purposes and adversely impacted the rate 
the company anticipates an effective tax rate of for liquidity and capital resources our working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  the company s cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments balance increased to million at december  from million at december  due primarily to positive cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by the purchases of property and equipment 
to provide immediate short term liquidity  should we need it  we entered into a million line of credit arrangement in march  this facility expires on september   but we may renew it for up to five years 
any borrowings against this line will bear an interest rate of libor plus as of march  
the facility is secured by cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
we are not obligated to pay any fees for the unused portion of this line 
to date  we have not borrowed against this line 
the company believes that the net proceeds of its initial and secondary offerings completed in  together with existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its normal working capital requirements for at least the next months 
thereafter  the company may require additional funds to support its working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to the company or that any additional financing would not be dilutive 
the company currently intends to use the net proceeds of its initial and secondary public offerings for working capital and general corporate purposes  including financing accounts receivable and capital expenditures made in the ordinary course of business  as well as for possible acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to those of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify any acquisitions of businesses  products or technology that are complementary to those of the company or are on terms that are acceptable to the company 
possible acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies could require the use of substantial amounts of capital  some of which might require the issuance of additional equity or debt securities 
pending such uses  the net proceeds will continue to be invested in government securities and other short term  investment grade  interest bearing instruments 
year issues background 
some computers  software and other equipment include programming code in which calendar year data is abbreviated to only two digits 
as a result of this design decision  some of these systems could fail to operate or fail to produce correct results if is interpreted to mean or some other default condition  rather than these problems and are commonly referred to as the millennium bug or year problem 
the year problem could have affected computers  software and other equipment that we and our customers and suppliers use 
accordingly  we reviewed our internal computer programs and systems to ensure that they were year compliant 
our expenditures to address potential year problems were not significant 
we have not experienced any year related problems to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of its investments

for the fiscal years  and  approximately  and of the company s consolidated revenues were derived from customers outside of north america  substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies 
similarly  substantially all of the expenses of operating the company s foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  the company s us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on the company s foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at december   the company estimates that a near term change in foreign currency rates would not materially affect its financial position  results of operations or net cash flows for the year ended december  the company used a value at risk var model to measure potential fair value losses due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company 
interest rate risk the company adheres to a conservative investment policy  whereby its principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing its yield on such assets 
cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments approximated million and million at december  and  respectively 
such amounts were invested in different types of investment grade securities with the intent of holding these securities to maturity 
although the company s portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold 
the company estimates that a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect its financial position  results of operations or net cash flows for the year ended december  the company used a value at risk var model to measure potential market risk on its marketable securities due to interest rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level
