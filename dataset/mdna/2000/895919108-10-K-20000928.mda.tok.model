annual results of operations the following table sets forth the percentages that consolidated statement of operations items are to net sales for the years ended june   and year ended june  revenue cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative income loss from operations other income interest income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net sales total revenue in fiscal increased to million  or  from million reported in fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily due to increases in unit volume shipments of notebook products having higher average selling prices asps  as well as a million payment from via relating to royalty and license revenue 
sales of portable products of million were approximately of our net sales in fiscal as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal sales of gui accelerator desktop products were approximately million or of our net sales in fiscal as compared to approximately million or in fiscal net sales in fiscal decreased to million  or  from million reported in fiscal the decrease in net sales was primarily due to decreases in unit volume shipments of approximately of graphical user interface gui accelerators and graphics controllers and a decline in average selling prices asps in the desktop area in fiscal as compared to fiscal sales of portable products of million were approximately of our net sales in fiscal as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal sales of gui accelerator desktop products were approximately million or of our net sales in fiscal as compared to approximately million or in fiscal we design products with the goal of filling the needs of leading pc systems manufacturers as well as the needs of adapter card manufacturers 
sales to leading pc systems manufacturers represented approximately of net sales for fiscal  an increase from in fiscal  and an increase from in fiscal sales to asian customers  primarily in hong kong  taiwan  korea  japan and singapore  accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
sales to three customers compaq  fujitsu  and toshiba accounted for approximately   and of net sales for fiscal  respectively 
sales to two customers  fujitsu and innoquest  accounted for approximately and of net sales for fiscal  respectively  and sales to two customers  union computer and fujitsu  accounted for approximately and of net sales for fiscal  respectively 
substantially all of the sales transactions were denominated in us dollars during all periods 
we derive a portion of our revenues from sales to distributors 
sales to distributors represented  and of net sales during the twelve months ended june   and  respectively 
during the first half of fiscal year the company experienced higher than usual returns resulting from certain distributors adjusting their inventory mix and levels 
we plan to develop new and higher performance graphics controllers and multimedia products to sell to existing customers as well as new customers in asia  north america and europe 
our future success depends upon our successful introduction of these and other new products on a regular and timely basis and upon those products meeting customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the development of new products or to commence shipments of new products in a timely manner  or that product specifications will not change during the development period 
in addition  even if such new products are successfully developed and shipped  there can be no assurance that they will be successfully developed and shipped  and there can be no assurance that they will be successful in the marketplace 
gross margin gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal our gross margin was higher in fiscal primarily due to the booking of million royalty and license revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal without the royalty and license revenue  our gross margin would have decreased by in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to an increase in the cost of embedded dram 
our gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross margins were generally lower in fiscal because of decreasing prices in desktop computers  and an increase in the cost of embedded dram for portable computers 
we believe that the prices of high technology products decline over time  as competition increases and new  advanced products are introduced 
we expect asps of existing products to continue to decline  although the asps of our entire product line may remain constant or increase as a result of introductions of new higher performance products often with additional functionality which are planned to be sold at higher prices 
our strategy is to maintain and improve gross margins by developing new products that have higher margins and migration to new process technology  and reducing manufacturing costs by improving production yield and utilizing newer process technology 
there is no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis or that we can reduce manufacturing costs 
research and development research and development expenditures increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and decreased from million in fiscal research and development expenditures as a percentage of net sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in non recurring engineering charges and an increase in headcount in our overseas research and development facility 
the decrease in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to our cost reduction efforts in fiscal we continue to develop a dptv tm dx product for the digital television market in china  japan  and korea 
we plan to continue developing the next generation dptv tm product as well as other advanced products for digital tv and digital stb 
however  there can be no assurance that these products will be quickly or widely accepted by consumers in the market place  nor that the new products will be developed and shipped in a timely manner 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenditures increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and were million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenditures as a percentage of net sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
selling expenditures were million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
general and administrative expenditures were million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
selling cost have declined in fiscal due to a decline in headcount and sales representative commissions 
selling costs have declined in fiscal years and due to the slow down in personal computer sales and reductions in marketing personnel 
general and administrative expenditures have increased in fiscal year s  compared to fiscal  and fiscal  primarily due to an increase in legal services 
interest income  net the amount of interest income earned by us varies directly with the amount of its cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and the prevailing interest rates 
net interest income remained flat at million in both fiscal and in fiscal net interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to lower cash balances in higher yielding short term investments 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased to million for the fiscal year ended june   due to the recording of tax provision for the umc non recurring gain in the long term investment in umc 
other income in august we made an investment of million in united integrated circuits corporation uicc 
on january   united microelectronics corporation umc acquired uicc 
as a result of this merger  and a stock dividend payable to shareholders of record may   we now own approximately million shares of umc 
accordingly  we reported a pretax gain of million as other income in our statement of operations for the quarter end june  the gain represents the difference between the cost of our previous investment in uicc  and the quoted market price of the umc shares on the taiwan stock exchange as of the date that umc acquired uicc 
during march  an investment in rise technology in the amount of million was deemed unrecoverable by our management and written off 
therefore  net gain on investments for the twelve months ended june   equals million 
under sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas any unrealized gains or losses on our short term investments are to be reported as a separate adjustment to equity 
accumulated other comprehensive income on the short term portion of our umc investment for the fiscal year ended june   was an unrealized loss of million 
other comprehensive income on the short term portion of our umc investment will be recomputed quarterly  and will fluctuate with market and industry conditions  and therefore could result in material losses or gains in any quarter 
factors that may affect our results operating loss in fiscal year we have experienced operating losses for the fiscal year s ending june  future performance will substantially depend upon numerous factors  such as timely introduction of new products and product enhancements to the marketplace  whether customers successfully incorporate our technologies into end products with high levels of customer acceptance  fluctuating price levels for our products 
trident s management is trying to expedite new product launching and to control operating expenses 
however  there is no guarantee that management s efforts will be successful 
sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses may increase as a result of shifts in the market place and the company s need to respond to these shifts  which could result in the need to generate significantly higher revenue to achieve and sustain profitability 
fluctuations in quarterly results we plan to control our operating expenses related to any expansion of our sales and marketing activities  broadening of our customer support capabilities  developing new distribution channels  and any increase in our research and development capabilities 
however  our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors including fluctuations in demand for our products  including seasonality  unexpected product returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and to manage product transitions  new product introductions by our competitors  our ability to achieve required cost reductions  our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products  delayed new product introductions  unfavorable responses to new products  adverse economic conditions  particularly in asia  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold  and availability of foundry and assembly capacities  delay of joint development efforts due to unexpected market conditions 
reliance on few key accounts to date  a limited number of distributors and customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
if any of our large distributors or customers stops or delays purchases  our revenue and profitability would be adversely affected 
although our largest customers may vary from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a small number of customers  particularly in light of the high sales price per unit of our portable products and the length of our sales cycles 
our original equipment manufacturer oem customers seldom release quarterly purchase orders and six month rolling forecasts 
in addition our financial performance depends on large orders from a few key distributors and other significant customers  we do not have binding long term commitments from any of them 
for example our oem customers can stop purchasing and our distributors can stop marketing our products with thirty days notice  our distributor agreements generally are not exclusive and the distributors have no obligation to renew agreements  and our distributor agreements generally do not require minimum purchases 
we have established a reserve program  which  under specified conditions  enables distributors to return products to us 
the amount of potential product returns is estimated and provided for in the period of the sale 
actual returns could differ from our estimates 
reliance on international sales although our revenues have historically been generated primarily from asian customers  primarily taiwan and japan  we will continue to exert efforts to expand our revenue base among the leading north american oems and odms 
our ability to grow will depend in part on this expansion in north america but will continue to be heavily based on international sales and operations  particularly taiwan  japan  and china which are expected to constitute a significant portion of our sales in the future 
in addition  there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including potentially longer accounts receivable collection cycles  import or export licensing requirements  potential adverse tax consequences  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
our international sales currently are us dollar denominated 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
intense competition in the market for graphics controllers the graphics controller industry in the sub  pc segment has experienced reduced margins due to a number of factors including competitive pricing pressures  increasing wafer cost and rapid technological change 
we anticipated that the discrete graphics controller demand from sub  pc s will continuously decrease in the future  while the demand for integrated graphics controllers will increase 
therefore  to maintain our revenue and gross margin  we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements and continually reduce our product cost 
our failure to do so would cause our revenue and gross margins to decline  which could have a materially adverse affect on our operating results 
the market for graphics controllers is intensely competitive 
many of our current competitors in graphics have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and market share than we do 
to remain competitive  we believe we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products  including products for new markets  increasing the ability of our products to integrate various functions and enhancing quality product performance 
if we fail to do so  our products may not compete favorably with those of our competitors  which could have a materially adverse affect on our revenue and future profitability 
we have developed a dptv tm dx product for the digital television market in china  japan  and korea 
however  we believe the market for digital television will be intensely competitive  and we will require substantial research development  sales and other expenditures to stay competitive in this market 
vulnerable to undetected product problems although we establish and implement test specifications  impose quality standards upon our suppliers and perform separate application based compatibility and system testing  our products may contain undetected defects  which may or may not be material  and which may or may not have a feasible solution 
we have experienced such errors in the past  and we can t ensure that such errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may materially adversely affect our business by causing us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and causing significant customer relations problems 
in part due to pricing and other pressures in the pc graphics market and in the desktop market in particular  we are developing products for introduction in non pc markets 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in eliminating undetected defects in these new products which may or may not be material 
dependance on independent foundries if the demand for our products grows  we will need to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions 
any disruptions in product flow could limit our revenue  adversely affect our competitive position and reputation and result in additional costs or cancellation of orders under agreements with our customers 
we currently rely on a limited number of third party foundries to manufacture our products either in finished form or wafer form 
generally  these foundries are not obligated to manufacture our products on a long term fixed price base  however  due to the company s investment in one foundry  a certain level of guaranteed wafer capacity does exist 
if we encounter shortages and delays in obtaining components  our ability to meet customer orders could be materially adversely affected 
we have experienced a delay in product shipments from a contract manufacturer in the past  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
such delays often result in purchasing at a higher per unit product cost from other foundries or the payment of expediting charges so that we can obtain the required supply in a timely manner 
we may in the future experience delays in shipments from foundries or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any of which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
unstable stock price the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be volatile 
factors such as new product announcements by trident or our competitors  quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and unfavorable conditions in the graphics controller market may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
these conditions  as well as factors that generally affect the market for stocks in general and stock in high technology companies in particular  could cause the price of trident s stock to fluctuate from time to time 
potential dilution of shareholders interest as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that would complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
we are very aggressively seeking investments opportunities in new businesses  and we expect to make investments in and may acquire businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership 
these actions by us could materially adversely affect our operating results and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risk associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and our failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  operation results and financial condition 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investments 
we have invested in numerous privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the startup or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose our entire initial investment in these companies 
our exposure to fluctuating market conditions could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
uncertainty of business restructuring continuing the strategic expansion into the internet appliance and digital tv marketplace  trident is now structured into two business units the videographics communications business unit and the digital media business unit 
the videographics communications business unit continues the company s entire d videographics business with worldwide pc oems  and intends to explore and expand into system on chip soc solutions for internet appliances and visual video communication 
it is under the management of frank lin as business unit president 
on the other hand  the company s digital media business unit focuses on the system on chip soc opportunities for the tv centric digital appliance market including internet ready digital tvs and digital set top boxes 
its immediate revenue ramp will come from the company s single chip digital television video processor dptv entering production during fiscal year the digital media business unit is under the management of dr 
jung herng chang as its president 
we believe that such a restructuring will permit us to rapidly grow our digital television product offerings  and continue to expand our graphics chip markets by efficiently allocating resources between the two divisions 
however  there is no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
on january   our board of directors approved a spin off of our trident technology incorporated subsidiary and our trident multimedia technologies shanghai co 
ltd 
subsidiary 
it is our belief that these subsidiaries would operate more efficiently if their operations were managed as independent entities 
as of june   we currently own a majority interest in both trident technology incorporated and trident multimedia technologies shanghai co 
ltd 
trident technology incorporated and trident multimedia technologies shanghai co 
ltd 
have total assets equal to million and million respectively 
it is our intention to spin off these subsidiaries after june  however  there are organizational  operational and marketing factors that may delay the spin off of these subsidiaries  and no assurance can be given that these subsidiaries will be profitable in the future 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million 
in fiscal year  million of cash was provided by operations  compared to fiscal  in which million of cash was used by operations 
cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to profitable operations  and decreases in accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses and other assets  offset by increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  and deferred taxes 
capital expenditures in fiscal   and were million  million  and million respectively 
in august we made an investment of million in united integrated circuits corporation uicc 
on january   united microelectronics corporation umc acquired uicc 
as a result of this merger  and a stock dividend payable to shareholders of record may   we now own approximately million shares of umc 
accordingly  we reported a pretax gain of million as other income in our statement of operations for the fiscal year the gain represents the difference between the cost of our previous investment in uicc  and the quoted market price of the umc shares on the taiwan stock exchange as of the date that umc acquired uicc 
at such time as we choose to sell any umc shares our gain or loss on such portion of the investment will be revalued 
as of today  a portion of the umc shares received by us as a result of the merger may now be sold at our discretion  however  in order to preserve the wafer capacity guarantee of the uicc facility  there are certain limitations on our ability to sell the shares 
during the march  an investment in rise technology in the amount of million was deemed unrecoverable by our management and written off 
therefore  net gain on investments for fiscal  equals approximately million 
we believe our current resources are sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
we regularly consider transactions to finance our activities  including debt and equity offerings and new credit facilities or other financing transactions 
we believe our current reserves are adequate 
on april   our board of directors approved an extension of the million stock repurchase program  originally approved in april  for another twelve months starting from april  to april  during fiscal year   shares of common stock were repurchased for million under this plan 
during fiscal years and   and  shares of common stock were repurchased for million and million under this plan  respectively 
in october  our board of directors authorized a one year budget of million allowing our president and executive officers to make investments  with no more than million in any one company or technology 
investments can be made on terms and agreements as the officers consider appropriate  within this authorization without further approval by the board 
the president of the company is to report at each board meeting on such activities 
at the end of fiscal year the cumulative purchases of investments totaled million 
on april   subject to the closing of the investment in trident described in the paragraph immediately below  our board of directors approved an increase in the annual budget of investments to million 
on february   we entered into an agreement with umc affiliates  unipac optoelectronics corp 
and hsun chieh investment co  ltd  to sell  shares of the company s common stock to unipac and  shares of the company s common stock to hsun chieh representing approximately of the common stock that will be outstanding after the new issuance 
on april   the trident board of directors approved an amendment to the existing agreement upon the request of these corporate investors 
under the terms of the amended agreement  the company agreed to adjust the stock purchase price due to the recent stock market volatility  aiming to continue the long term strategic relationship and further strengthen the company s cash position for future strategic expansion 
we expect that the proceeds of the stock purchase from the sale of the company s stock to unipac and hsun chieh will be approximately usd million  with a per share price equal to the five day average closing price of trident stock preceding april   plus a ten percent premium on such average 
however  we believe that the total aggregate consideration and the number of shares of our common stock sold pursuant to this transaction may be reduced to conform with applicable regulatory requirements 
closing of this transaction is contingent upon governmental and nasd regulatory approval  and other customary closing conditions 
on april   via technologies  inc and trident microsystems  inc 
announced that they have agreed to resolve all pending lawsuits 
both parties agreed to enter a settlement agreement in order to better focus on respective businesses and avoid the costs  time and distractions of a lengthy legal process 
under the terms of the agreement  trident will receive usd million payable in two installments from via for a desktop software driver license fee  contingent on the dismissal of all pending lawsuits in us and taiwan  which is not in complete control of trident and via 
the first installment of million will be paid seven days after the dismissal of the lawsuit and the taiwan action 
the second installment of million will be paid ninety days after the first installment 
on june   we also reached an agreement with via and released the blade d source code which generated royalty and license revenue of million in our fiscal statement of operations  and we have also agreed to a new joint chip development with via
