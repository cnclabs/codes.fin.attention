this growth outside the us has been fueled by recent international acquisitions  primarily in europe 
for the year ended december   the company s non us business accounted for approximately of net sales see note to the consolidated financial statements 
growth of both us and us businesses is shown below year ended december  change in millions net sales us   non us   year ended december  change in millions net sales us   non us  market risk the company s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and certain commodity prices 
pursuant to the company s policies  natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company s primary market risk is interest rate exposure  primarily in the united states 
the company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate exposure was reduced significantly in from the issuance of million company obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a subsidiary trust  the proceeds of which reduced commercial paper 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions  and  for qualifying hedges  the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense 
the company s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less 
the company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows  structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk  converting excess foreign currency deposits into us dollars or the relevant functional currency and avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency 
in addition  the company utilizes forward contracts and purchased options to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions 
derivatives used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the consolidated statements of income 
due to the diversity of its product lines  the company does not have material sensitivity to any one commodity 
the company manages commodity price exposures primarily through the duration and terms of its vendor contracts 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model 
the value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods 
it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and including substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equity method investments 
the fair value losses shown in the table below have no impact on results of operations or financial condition as they represent economic not financial losses 
time confidence amount period level in millions interest rates day foreign exchange day the confidence interval signifies the company s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above 
the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company s favor 
the value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse 
actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time  and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time 
these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses  since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets 
euro currency conversion on january   the euro became the common legal currency for of the member countries of the european union 
on that date  the participating countries fixed conversion rates between their exiting sovereign currencies legacy currencies and the euro 
on january   the euro began trading on currency exchanges and became available for non cash transactions  if the parties elect to use it 
the legacy currencies will remain legal tender through december  beginning january   participating countries will introduce euro denominated bills and coins  and effective july   legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender 
after the dual currency phase  all businesses in participating countries must conduct all transactions in the euro and must convert their financial records and reports to be euro based 
the company has commenced an internal analysis of the euro conversion process to prepare its information technology systems for the conversion and analyze related risks and issues  such as the benefit of the decreased exchange rate risk in cross border transactions involving participating countries and the impact of increased price transparency on cross border competition in these countries 
the company believes that the euro conversion process will not have a material impact on the company s businesses or financial condition on a consolidated basis
