overview when the company acquired the assets and certain liabilities of made in nature  inc on june   sonomawest operated in three business segments industrial dried fruit ingredients  organic packaged goods and real estate 
the company commenced a strategic reorientation upon the announcement of the proposed sale of its apple based industrial ingredients product line in june in august the decision was made to sell or discontinue all product lines in the company s industrial dried fruit ingredients business 
in january  the company decided to sell or discontinue its organic packaged goods business 
as a result of these decisions  both of these business segments are considered discontinued operations and their operating results  results of cash flows and net assets are reflected outside of the company s continuing operations 
the company s sole remaining line of business is its real estate management and rental operations 
discontinued operations in july  the company sold the bulk of its apple based industrial ingredients product line to tree top  inc  of selah  washington 
this product line represented and of the company s sales for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this sale  which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal  is an important element of the company s strategic plan to increase the return on its investments and increase shareholder value by exiting businesses with low returns and high capital requirements 
the transaction provided financial resources to support the company s real estate and other business opportunities 
following completion of the sale  the company determined in august that the remaining product lines in the company s vacuum ingredients segment of its business would be discontinued and held for sale 
these product lines included the company s dried ingredients  perma pak long term food storage  and drink mix businesses 
in january  the company decided to sell or discontinue its organic packaged goods business 
as a result of these decisions  the company has classified these business segments as discontinued operations 
accordingly  the company has segregated the net assets of the discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets at june  and  the operating results of the discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal   and and the cash flows from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal   and in fiscal  the company recorded after tax earnings from discontinued operations of  on sales of million for the ingredients business and million for the organic packaged goods business 
this compares to an after tax loss of million on sales of million for the ingredients business and million for the organic packaged goods business in fiscal the decline in sales in the ingredients business is due to the sale of the apple ingredients business during the first quarter of fiscal and a significant decline in the sales of perma pak food storage products 
the decline in sales in the organic packaged goods business is due to the sale of the dried fruit business in the fourth quarter of fiscal after the allocation of selling  general and administrative expenses between continuing and discontinued operations  the discontinued businesses generated  of operating income in fiscal versus an operating loss of million in fiscal included in cost of sales  however  in fiscal is the write down of food storage inventories by million to reflect estimated net realizable value 
while the company experienced exceptionally strong food storage sales through the third quarter of fiscal  sales have declined substantially since that time 
the organic packaged goods business generated an operating loss of million in fiscal the company is actively marketing all remaining assets of its discontinued businesses primarily inventory  but there can be no assurances that there will be a sale of all or any of the remaining assets 
results of continuing operations the company s sole continuing line of business is its real estate management and rental operations 
see item  properties  above for a further discussion of the company s real estate operations 
subsequent event the company elected to prepay in full the remaining shareholder note payable scheduled to mature in as of august   in the amount of  plus accrued interest 
accordingly  this amount is reflected in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
fiscal compared to fiscal rental revenue 
the company leases warehouse  production  and office space as well as outside storage space at both of its properties 
there are leases with approximately twenty tenants that have varying original terms ranging from month to month to eight years with options to extend 
fiscal rental revenue increased or  over fiscal this increase was primarily a result of leasing activities at the company s former production facility 
this facility is approximately occupied 
the company s other property is approximately occupied 
while the company and its retained broker are actively marketing the properties to prospective tenants  there can be no assurance that tenants will be found in the near term 
as a result  the company s operating results will be negatively impacted as long as the tenant rental revenue stream fails to cover existing operating costs 
operating costs 
operating costs consist of direct costs related to continuing operations and all general corporate costs 
only direct selling  general and administrative costs related to the ingredients and organic packaged goods businesses were allocated to discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
in fiscal  operating costs related to continuing operations increased or  from the prior year 
this change was primarily due to increased temporary labor costs incurred during the first two quarters of fiscal interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense net consists primarily of interest income on the company s cash balances  and interest expense on mortgage debt and shareholder loans 
proceeds from the sale of the ingredients business received in july were used to pay off the company s revolving bank line of credit and substantially reduce long term debt 
as a result  in fiscal  the company was a net investor of cash  generating  of interest income and incurring  of interest expense  while in the prior year it was a net borrower  generating interest income of  and incurring interest expense of income taxes 
the fiscal effective tax rate changed from a benefit of to a charge of  due primarily to lower tax credits in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal rental revenue 
rental revenue in fiscal increased or  from fiscal this increase was a result of higher market rental rates  cpi increases and the leasing of some previously vacant space 
operating costs 
operating costs increased or  due to salaries and benefits associated with increased staffing  increased legal and professional fees  and increased temporary labor costs 
interest and other income expense  net 
other expense increased or  due primarily to the interest expense on the mortgage debt originated in fiscal  and the full year impact of the interest expense on the shareholder notes originated in fiscal income taxes 
the effective tax rate changed from a charge of to a benefit of  primarily due to an increase in tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash of million at june   and current maturities of long term debt of  the company used a portion of the million net proceeds from its discontinued businesses to pay off borrowings under its bank line of credit and retire a significant portion of its long term debt 
cash balances increased from  at june  primarily as a result of these net proceeds 
the company has contingently committed itself to a million investment in a privately held telecommunications company  metropcs  inc  which is expected to be funded in fiscal if certain agreed upon contingencies are satisfied 
the company is considering a potential share repurchase program  or  alternatively  a shareholder distribution of any cash balances in excess of that required for the metropcs  inc investment and support of the company s real estate management and rental operations 
there can be no assurance that any or all of the contemplated actions will take place
