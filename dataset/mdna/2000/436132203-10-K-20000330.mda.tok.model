as no asset value was attributed to the management and consulting agreements for financial reporting purposes when acquired and terminated  the million payment  together with net expenses from the acquisition amounting to  were charged to expense in expenses incurred under the management and consulting agreements amounted to million  million and million  respectively  during prior to the october termination date  and write down of assets in connection with a refinancing of its indebtedness in  gbcc issued million discounted principal amount face amount of million of deferred interest notes the ppi funding notes to hcc in exchange for million principal amount of notes issued by another gbcc subsidiary and held by hcc 
it was anticipated that one of hcc s primary methods of realizing the carrying value of the new notes would be through the utilization of existing tax net operating losses of gbcc and its subsidiaries 
as a result of hcc s distribution of gbcc stock at december  to its shareholders  gbcc s tax net operating losses are no longer available for utilization in hcc s consolidated tax returns 
due to the filing for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code by gbcc s most significant operating subsidiary on january   hcc took a write down during reducing the carrying amount of the ppi funding notes to an estimated realizable value of million 
this remaining estimated net realizable balance was fully reserved in as the acquisition of pcc by hcc in october terminated the aurora casino management contract and tunica casino consulting agreement 
these agreements provided a source of funds to gbcc which is now no longer available 
in addition  acsc  which is gbcc s only remaining operating subsidiary  experienced a loss from operations in  further reducing cash flows available for repayment of the ppi funding notes

interest income increased  during compared to as a result of more cash being available for investment purposes during interest expense interest expense increased by million during compared to the prior year due primarily to the increase in hcc s long term indebtedness from the may issuance of the senior secured notes and the august issuance of million of first mortgage notes with respect to the shreveport casino 
although the issuance of the senior secured notes increased hcc s indebtedness to a face value of million from a face value of million  the effective interest rate fell to from 
the interest rate on million of the senior secured notes is equal to the six month libor rate plus and is reset semiannually

income taxes management believes that it is more likely than not that future consolidated taxable income of hcc primarily from the aurora casino and the tunica casino will be sufficient to utilize a portion of the nol s  tax credits and other deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences 
accordingly  under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  the consolidated balance sheet reflects net deferred tax assets of million as of december  sales by hcc or existing stockholders of common stock can cause a change of control  as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  which would limit the ability of hcc or its subsidiaries to utilize these loss carryforwards in later tax periods 
should such a change of control occur  the amount of loss carryforwards available for use in any one year would most likely be substantially reduced 
future treasury regulations  administrative rulings or court decisions may also effect hcc s future utilization of its loss carryforwards 
tax settlement costs tax settlement costs of million in represent costs incurred arising from and directly related to hcc s tax treatment of the spin off of gbcc

consequently  the results of hcc s operations for the first and fourth quarters have traditionally been less profitable than the other quarters of the fiscal year 
furthermore  management believes that seasonality may also cause fluctuations in reported results at the tunica casino

capital expenditures and other investing activities aurora casino capital expenditures at the aurora casino during were million  management anticipates spending million during toward its ongoing capital improvements program 
significant projects planned for include new slot machines  renovations to restaurants and other departmental expenditures 
in addition  the company is currently finalizing plans to replace the aurora casino s two riverboats with a newly constructed  permanently moored dockside casino 
as currently planned  the new facility will significantly increase passenger capacity and provide a premier gaming and entertainment facility for the aurora casino s patrons 
the new facility is projected to cost approximately million and will require a construction period of months 
construction of the dockside casino is expected to begin as soon as possible following receipt of required regulatory approvals and the resolution of certain litigation as described below 
upon the finalization of plans  the receipt of all required approvals and the resolution of the litigation  the aurora casino will amortize the remaining net book value of its existing riverboats approximately million at december  over the estimated month construction period prior to the boats being removed from service

the company intends to build its new dockside casino in two halves  which will be connected to form a single dockside casino 
the company is considering proceeding with the construction of the first half of the dockside casino prior to the final resolution of the litigation described below 
if the company proceeds with this approach  it would attempt to place all of its gaming positions on the first half of the dockside casino and would not develop the second half of the facility until the litigation is resolved 
a complaint was filed in late in an illinois state court concerning the constitutionality of a portion of the legislation that enabled dockside gaming in illinois 
although the constitutional challenge centers on the relocation of one of the existing gaming licenses  a finding that such portion of the legislation is unconstitutional could result in a finding that all or a portion of the legislation  including dockside gaming  is invalid 
pending the resolution of this litigation  the company s planned dockside expansion of the aurora casino has been delayed 
if the state court rules that all or a portion of the legislation is invalid  management believes that it may be able to continue to operate its existing riverboats on a dockside basis pending a final resolution of the litigation 
if the provisions in question are found to be unconstitutional after all appeals  and the entire legislation is invalidated and it appears that the illinois legislature will not pass new legislation enabling dockside gaming  then the company will likely modify its expansion plans for the aurora casino
