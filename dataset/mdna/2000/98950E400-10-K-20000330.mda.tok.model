item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general through its subsidiaries  zevex is in the business of designing  manufacturing and distributing medical devices 
the company s product lines include proprietary medical devices which it designs  manufactures  and distributes  and contract manufactured products which it designs and manufactures for original equipment manufacturers oem s 
zevex current strategy is to continue to aggressively grow proprietary product revenues with the acquisition and internal development of products that complement its existing two lines of proprietary products 
this is intended to augment zevex contract manufacturing business  which historically has been the core competence of zevex 
developments during the company substantially grew revenues and earnings during  diversifying its offering of proprietary products further and gaining market share in both proprietary markets  as well as growing its contract manufacturing business 
key contributors to the year s growth were the acquisition in july  of nutrition medical inc s product line of stationary feeding pumps  disposable sets and feeding tubes for enteral nutrition delivery 
the acquisition on december   of jtech medical industries  inc jtech manufactures and markets its own proprietary musculoskeletal evaluation products for health care providers  a line of products not previously manufactured or sold by zevex 
the acquisition on december   of aborn electronics  inc aborn designs and manufactures a variety of sophisticated optical sensors  custom computer chips and semiconductor components for medical technology and other companies  and has brought new design and manufacturing expertise to the company 
the agreement with applied medical technology  inc on may  to distribute amt s mini tm button low profile gastrostomy access devices within the home care market 
management believes that this important component used in enteral nutrition delivery will be a significant addition to the company s growing product line 
results of operations the company s sales results for were the strongest in the company s history 
revenues were  a increase over revenues of  in  which were a increase over revenues of  in revenues for increased primarily due to demand for the company s proprietary products  the award of significant engineering and manufacturing service contracts  and the contribution of the acquisitions of the nutrition medical product line  aborn  and jtech 
also contributing to the year s performance was a strong shift of contract manufacturing revenue from the first quarter of into the fourth quarter of due to the accelerated shipment of products in late at the request of zevex inc s customers 
the company estimates that this shift involves  to million 
accordingly  company management expects the revenues for the first quarter of to be lower than expected 
this is due not only to the shift in revenues described above  but also due to reduced sales of enteral feeding pumps to nestle in the first quarter of this reduction in sales to nestle  estimated to be as much as  was due to the anticipated acquisition of nestle assets described previously 
the company s current strategy as stated above is to continue to aggressively grow proprietary product revenues with the acquisition and internal development of proprietary products that complement its existing two lines of proprietary products 
this strategy is intended to augment continuing growth in zevex inc s contract manufacturing business  which historically has been the core competence of zevex 
as a result of the growth of the company s proprietary product business  the portion of the company s revenues represented by that business has risen significantly over prior years 
in  of the company s revenue was derived from proprietary products sold by the company  in comparison to in and in this shift in revenue sources has the benefit of decreasing the percentage of the company s revenues generated by a small number of major customers 
during  only one customer accounted for over of the company s revenues  generating of total revenues 
during and  three customers each accounted for over of the company s revenues  together generating and of total revenues in each year respectively 
future revenue growth for many of the medical devices manufactured by the company may be dependent in part on availability of adequate reimbursement for those devices from third party health care payers  such as government and private insurance plans 
the medical products industry is also subject to significant technological change and requires ongoing investment to keep pace with technological development  quality  and regulatory requirements 
in order to compete in this marketplace  the company will be required to make ongoing investments in research and development with respect to its existing and future products 
manufacturing revenue growth depends upon growth in demand for systems  devices  and instruments manufactured by the company  as well as on the company s ability to acquire additional manufacturing service contracts from medical technology companies 
the company s contract manufacturing customers have complete control over the marketing and sales of products that the company manufactures for them 
the company has no ability to increase demand for instruments that it manufactures for its contract manufacturing customers 
no assurances can be given that orders from any customer will increase or remain at current levels or that they will not decline 
the company markets its manufacturing capabilities and rarely undertakes design work without securing manufacturing rights see manufacturing capabilities 
the volume and timing of future manufacturing revenues related to any specific engineering project are highly variable 
certain engineering projects may not lead to future manufacturing revenues 
the manufacturing gross margin percentage from year to year depends primarily on the product mix  as gross margins vary by instrument and as a result of negotiated volume discounts 
management may negotiate volume discounts if the larger volume results in smaller per unit overhead  improving operating margin 
the gross margin percentage for manufacturing revenues from instruments not yet approved for commercial use is generally lower because a smaller number of units produced limits opportunities to achieve economies of scale 
additionally  the instrument and its manufacturing process are being refined  resulting in larger per unit costs during the initial manufacturing phase 
the company s annual and quarterly operating results are affected by acceptance of the markets for the company s proprietary and contract manufactured products  including the volume and timing of customer orders  which vary due to i variation in demand for the customer s products as a result of  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions  and general economic conditions  ii the customer s attempt to balance its inventory  iii the customer s need to adapt to changing regulatory conditions and requirements  and iv changes in the customer s manufacturing strategy 
technical difficulties and delays in the design and manufacturing processes may also affect such results 
the foregoing factors may cause fluctuations in revenues and variations in product mix  which could in turn cause fluctuations in the company s gross margin 
during the first quarter of  the company had continued to work with a certain customer on a fixed price contract  which had an adverse impact on the company s gross margin 
also during  the company completed a reengineering project with a customer on a cost sharing basis which adversely affected gross margin 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain items in the income statement bear to revenues 
year ended december  income statement data percentage of gross sales revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating income other income expense income before taxes provisions for taxes net income sales of the company s proprietary enteral feeding products line accounted for approximately of the total revenues for the year ended december   compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales of the company s proprietary jtech product line  accounted for approximately of the total revenues for the year 
fifty three percent of the company s revenues during the year were products that are manufactured for and sold to oem customers  who market the final product 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  as compared to in and in management attributes the increase in gross profit percentage from to to a number of matters  including a shift in the revenue mix of its products to higher margin items that were sold during  consistent delivery schedules dictated by the company s larger customers  and the company not having similar costs to those incurred in related to the nutrition medical acquisition as well as non recurring engineering nre tooling expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during to  of gross sales  as compared to  of gross sales in  and  of gross sales in during  increased expenses resulted from the company s continuing growth  which has resulted primarily from the acquisitions of jtech and aborn 
an expanded sales and marketing effort increased staffing  travel  advertising  and administrative expenses related to the company s proprietary clinical nutrition delivery product line and jtech product lines 
the company also had an increase in expenses related to employees  such as insurance  taxes  and pension benefits 
after consideration for the one time expenditures related to the nutrition medical product line acquisition  the company believes that general and administrative expenses in as related to sales will continue at approximately the same percentage as in the previous two years 
as of december   the company had three full time engineers in research and development  and had several other designers and engineers contributing to research and development projects 
the company s research and development projects are primarily focused on new proprietary products 
during the last three fiscal years  the company continued independent research and development activities with respect to the design of new and improved devices  spending  in   in  and  in in and  research and development costs represented approximately of revenues in each of those years and in significant fluctuations experienced in research and development are due to timing of the company s research projects 
the company expects research and developments costs in to be approximately of revenues 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to  in from  in  and  in this increase reflects increased depreciation due to capital expenditures for property and equipment purchased to increase engineering  design  and manufacturing capabilities to support anticipated growth  as well as increased amortization of goodwill related to acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of companies and products the company purchased over the fair value of the tangible and other specifically identified intangible assets of those companies and products 
goodwill amortization lives were determined by comparing recent acquisitions of similar companies and industries 
goodwill is amortized over a periods ranging from to years 
the current value of goodwill included in the financial statements is  and represents approximately of total assets 
income tax expenses increased to  in from  in  and  in the increase is primarily due to the increased income before taxes and non deductible goodwill amortization 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets of approximately  realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on the company s ability to generate approximately  in taxable income in the year the assets are realized 
management believes that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 
management will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets annually and assess the need for valuation allowances 
operating income increased to  of gross revenue in compared to  of gross revenue in  and  of gross revenue in similarly  the company had a net income of  of gross revenue in  compared to  of gross revenue in  and  of gross revenue in the changes during as compared to and are principally due to the increase in revenues from proprietary products  the costs addressed above in relation to cost of sales and selling  general and administrative costs  and changes in the company s product mix of higher margin items delivered during the year 
liquidity and capital resources the company increased its working capital requirements during  mostly as a result of increasing accounts receivable associated with growth in revenues and the company s efforts to expand its operations by acquisitions of products and technologies 
prior to  working capital had been funded primarily by a combination of increased accounts payable and borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
beginning in  working capital was also provided by a million private placement of zevex common stock and warrants in february  and a secondary public offering of zevex common stock in november  from which zevex received approximately million in net proceeds 
during  the company produced  in net income 
cash and cash equivalents increased by  for from operating activities  as the company had an increase in payables and decreased its inventories which was offset by increased accounts receivable which increased as the company continued to expand its proprietary businesses and meet customer requirements 
during  the company had net income of  and cash and cash equivalents decreased from operating activities by  as the company funded increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
during  the company had net income of  and cash and cash equivalents decreased by  from operating activities  while the company funded an increase in accounts receivable 
in  the company completed construction of its new  square foot headquarters and manufacturing facility 
the cost of this undertaking was approximately  in  the company negotiated a million industrial development bond to finance this construction 
the company s purchases of land  leasehold improvements to its facilities  and new research  production  testing equipment  and tooling totaled  in  as compared to  in  and  in the amount spent during is primarily attributed to the company s purchase of approximately acres of land adjacent to the company s current facility in salt lake city in march  as well as to continued upgrading of the company s production fixturing  tooling  and research and engineering capabilities 
the difference in purchases between and is primarily due to the construction of the company s headquarters and manufacturing facility and upgrading the company s production fixturing  tooling and research and engineering capabilities during the company s working capital at december   was  compared to  at december   and  at december  the portion of working capital represented by cash and short term investments at such dates was   and  respectively 
in  the company s increase in working capital of  was primarily due to operating activities 
the decrease in working capital during compared to is primarily attributed to i cash outlays and current payables related to the acquisitions of the product line from nutrition medical and the stock purchases of jtech and aborn  ii increases in accounts and accrued payables  and iii an increase of the company s line of credit 
in  the increase in working capital was primarily attributed to i completion of a secondary offering of the company s common stock in november   of approximately million  ii increased income from operations during the year  and iii a private placement that was completed in february  on december   zevex issued  shares of common stock and paid  to nutrition medical  inc as consideration for the acquisition of nutrition medical s assets relating to its enteral feeding pump and related disposable feeding product business

subsequent acquisition in line with the company s strategy of acquiring additional proprietary product lines  on march   the company entered into an agreement to acquire from nestle usa  inc nestle a portion of nestle s enteral nutrition delivery device business 
in the asset purchase  the company will acquire over  enteral feeding pumps which have been placed with various health care facilities under arrangements whereby the users commit to purchase disposable accessories for use with the feeding pumps or return the pumps 
the assets will also include nestle s line of pump administration sets  feeding tubes  irrigation kits and ancillary devices 
based on nestle s historical experience generating revenues from the acquired assets  the company currently estimates that the nestle assets will generate approximately million in additional revenue to the company during through the sale of disposable accessories for the feeding pumps currently in use 
the company currently anticipates that the acquisition will close by april  under the purchase agreement with nestle  nestle will provide certain transition services to assist the company in acquiring the business with a minimum of disruption for the customers using the acquired pumps 
there is no assurance  however  that during the transition of the business from nestle  the company will not encounter difficulties which reduce the revenues generated by the pumps following the acquisition 
in particular  there is no assurance that the users of the pumps acquired from nestle will continue to purchase disposable accessories from the company at the rate historically experienced by nestle  in which case the anticipated revenue estimated by the company might not be realized 
year compliance state of readiness with regard to its information systems financial  supply  inventory  order  office support  etc 
the company timely converted all necessary systems and was ready for the year of the necessary systems have been determined to be yk compliant by the company  or have been upgraded to new systems which are certified by the manufacturer as year compliant 
with regard to its non information system operations  the company has reviewed and corrected yk problems in the following areas products currently manufactured by the company  manufacturing and engineering systems  and building systems 
this review is complete and the company has been able to correct each material yk issue identified in the review 
with regard to potential yk issues for the company s major material suppliers  the company has not yet identified any major supplier that believes it will be unable to operate due to yk problems in generally  the company has alternative sources for supplies in the event a supplier experiences such difficulties and the company does not presently anticipate material difficulties in obtaining materials due to suppliers yk problems 
with regard to major customers  the company has had communications with such parties and has reviewed responses regarding yk compliance 
to date  the company has not experienced any problems regarding yk difficulties with such customers 
with regard to third party utilities and services for example  telephone electrical  bankcard processing and shipping services  the company has not experienced any problems regarding yk readiness of such providers 
cost to address yk issues as of march   the company has spent approximately  in hardware and software expenses to upgrade or correct yk problems with the company s internal systems 
these costs were paid out of operating cash flows 
the company does not expect to incur any additional costs for further upgrades and corrections relating to the yk issue 
the costs stated above do include  however  costs to upgrade and replace systems that the company otherwise would have incurred in the normal course of business 
the company has not yet been able to estimate the costs it may incur as a result of its suppliers and customers experiencing yk difficulties 
risk of the company s yk issues the company anticipates that the material risks related to its information and non information systems has been timely mitigated by the efforts made by the company to identify and correct internal yk problems 
however  there is no guarantee that the company has successfully identified or corrected all yk problems in a timely manner 
for example  due to the inherent limitations of real time clock devices and system bios in the company s manufacturing equipment or building systems  continued review and testing could uncover additional problems 
in some cases  problems may be unforeseen  and occur regardless of the testing and review that has been done 
other major yk risks for the company arise from the potential for major customers to experience financial or operational difficulties resulting from yk problems 
if such customers reduce their orders for the company s products or services  the company s operations could be adversely affected 
additionally  although the company has not experienced any disruption in service from third party providers that supply telephone  electrical  banking and shipping services  any disruption of these critical services would hinder the company s ability to receive  process and ship orders
