in  the company recoded its loan portfolio to reflect the business purpose of the loans 
detailed information prior to is unavailable due to a system conversion in each of the following principal product lines is an outgrowth of the company s expertise in meeting the particular needs of the small and medium sized businesses and consumers in the asian and hispanic communities commercial and industrial loans 
the primary lending focus of the company is to small and medium sized businesses in a wide variety of industries 
the company s commercial lending emphasis includes loans to wholesalers  manufacturers and business service companies 
a broad range of short and medium term commercial lending products are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and accounts receivable  purchases of equipment and machinery and business expansion including acquisitions of real estate and improvements 
generally  the company s commercial loans are underwritten on the basis of the borrower s ability to service such debt as reflected by cash flow projections 
commercial loans are generally secured by business assets  which may include accounts receivable and inventory  certificates of deposit  securities  real estate  guarantees or other collateral 
the company also generally obtains personal guarantees from the principals of the business 
working capital loans are primarily collateralized by short term assets  whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by long term assets 
as a result  commercial loans involve additional complexities  variables and risks and require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types of loans 
indigenous to individuals in the asian business community is the desire to own the building and land which houses their businesses 
accordingly  while a loan may be principally driven and classified by the type of business operated  real estate is frequently the primary source of collateral 
as of december   approximately million or of the commercial and industrial loan portfolio was secured by real estate 
the company continually monitors real estate value trends and takes into consideration changes in market trends in its underwriting standards 
commercial loans are generally for amounts between  and  and as of december   the average commercial loan amount was  as of december   the company s commercial and industrial loan portfolio totaled million or of the gross loan portfolio 
at that date  the company had a concentration of loans to hotels and motels of million 
hotel and motel lending was originally targeted by the company because of management s particular expertise in this industry and a perception that it was an under served market 
more recently  the company has decreased its emphasis in hotel and motel lending in order to further diversify its portfolio 
commercial mortgage loans 
in addition to commercial loans  the company makes commercial mortgage loans to finance the purchase of real property  which generally consists of developed real estate 
the company s commercial mortgage loans are secured by first liens on real estate  typically have variable rates and amortize over a to year period with balloon payments due at the end of five to seven years 
payments on loans secured by such properties are dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties 
accordingly  repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than other types of loans 
in underwriting commercial mortgage loans  consideration is given to the property s historical cash flow  current and projected occupancy  location and physical condition 
the underwriting analysis also includes credit checks  appraisals  environmental impact reports and a review of the financial condition of the borrower 
as of december   the company had a commercial mortgage portfolio of million 
construction loans 
the company makes loans to finance the construction of residential and non residential properties 
the substantial majority of the company s residential construction loans are for single family dwellings which are pre sold or are under earnest money contract 
the company also originates loans to finance the construction of commercial properties such as multi family  office  industrial  warehouse and retail centers 
construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction  and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion 
because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs  the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property  it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio 
as a result of these uncertainties  construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent  in part  on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan 
if the company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion  there is no assurance that the company will be able to recover all of the unpaid portion of the loan 
in addition  the company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminable period of time 
while the company has underwriting procedures designed to identify what it believes to be acceptable levels of risks in construction lending  no assurance can be given that these procedures will prevent losses from the risks described above 
as of december   the company had a real estate construction portfolio of million  of which million was residential and million was commercial 
residential mortgage brokerage and lending 
the company uses its existing branch network to offer a complete line of single family residential mortgage products through third party mortgage companies 
the company specializes in mortgages that conform with government sponsored programs  such as those offered by the federal national mortgage association fnma and the houston housing partnership 
the residential mortgage products generally amortize over five to years and usually have a maximum term of five years 
the company solicits and receives a fee to process these residential mortgage loans  which are then pre sold to and underwritten by third party mortgage companies 
the company does not fund or service these loans 
the volume of residential mortgage loans processed by the company and presold to third party mortgage companies increased from million in to million at december  since the company does not fund these loans  there is no risk of nonpayment to the company 
the company also makes five to seven year balloon residential mortgage loans with a year amortization to its existing customers on a select basis  which are retained in the company s portfolio 
residential mortgage collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
at december   the company s residential mortgage portfolio totaled million 
government guaranteed small business lending 
the company has developed an expertise in several government guaranteed lending programs in order to provide credit enhancement to its commercial and industrial and mortgage portfolio 
as a preferred lender under the federally guaranteed sba lending program  the company s preapproved status allows it to quickly respond to customers needs 
under this program  the company originates and funds sba a and chapter loans qualifying for federal guarantees of to of principal and accrued interest

over the last seven years  the company has originated over million in sba guaranteed loans 
as of december   the company had million in the retained portion of sba loans  approximately million of which was guaranteed by the sba 
for each of the last six years  the company has been the second largest sba loan originator in houston in terms of dollar volume 
sba loan originations were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
another source of government guaranteed lending is b i loans which are secured by the us department of agriculture and are available to borrowers in areas with a population of less than  the company also offers guaranteed loans through the occgf  which is sponsored by the government of taiwan 
these loans are for people of chinese decent or origin  who are not mainland chinese by birth and reside overseas 
as of december   the company s occgf portfolio totaled million 
factoring 
in  the company established an accounts receivable factoring subsidiary  advantage  to provide financing to small and medium sized businesses that have accounts receivable from predominantly fortune  companies 
in factoring receivables  advantage relies heavily on the quality of the client s accounts receivable and the financial strength of the client s customers  who typically make their payments directly to a lockbox controlled by advantage 
as a result  these transactions are subject to risks relating to disputes between the company s client and its customers in instances where the customer refuses to make payment 
advantage s clients are typically businesses that are experiencing rapid growth and have an increased demand for working capital  usually with annual sales between million and million 
advantage s volume of purchases has grown steadily since  its first full year of operations  from million in short term usually day accounts receivable to million during at december   factored receivables outstanding totaled million  compared with million at december  in addition to enhancing profitability  many of the customers obtained through these efforts have also established more traditional banking relationships with the company 
trade finance 
since its inception in  the company has originated trade finance loans and letters of credit to facilitate export and import transactions for small and medium sized businesses 
in this capacity  the company has worked with the ex im bank  an agency of the us government which provides guarantees for trade finance loans 
in  the company was named small business bank of the year by the ex im bank  and it was the largest ex im bank producer in the state of texas 
trade finance credit facilities rely heavily on the quality of the business customer s accounts receivable and the ability to perform the underlying transaction which  if monitored and controlled properly  limits the financial risks to the company associated with this short term financing 
to mitigate the risk of nonpayment  the company generally obtains a governmental guaranty or credit insurance from a governmental agency such as the ex im bank 
at december   the company s aggregate trade finance portfolio commitments totaled approximately million 
the company offers a wide variety of loan products to retail customers through its branch network in houston and dallas 
loans to retail customers include residential mortgage loans  residential construction loans  automobile loans  lines of credit and other personal loans 
the terms and size of these loans typically range from to months depending on the nature of the collateral and the size of the loan 
the company selectively extends credit for the purpose of establishing long term relationships with its customers 
the company mitigates the risks inherent in lending by focusing on businesses and individuals with demonstrated payment history  historically favorable profitability trends and stable cash flows 
in addition to these primary sources of repayment  the company looks to tangible collateral and personal guarantees as secondary sources of repayment 
lending officers are provided with detailed underwriting policies covering all lending activities in which the company is engaged and that require all lenders to obtain appropriate approvals for the extension of credit 
the company also maintains documentation requirements and extensive credit quality assurance practices in order to identify credit portfolio weaknesses as early as possible so any exposures that are discovered may be reduced 
inherent in all lending is the risk of nonpayment 
the types of collateral required  the terms of the loans and the underwriting practices discussed under each category above are all designed to minimize the risk of nonpayment 
in addition  as further risk protection  the company rarely makes loans at its legal lending limit 
although the company s legal loan limit is million  the company generally does not make loans larger than million 
loans are approved by lending officers and the directors credit committee pursuant to a lending authorization schedule delegated by the directors credit committee which is based on each loan officer s credit experience and portfolio 
control systems and procedures are in place to ensure all loans are approved in accordance with credit policies 
the company s policies and procedures designed to minimize the risk of nonpayment with respect to outstanding loans are discussed under nonperforming assets 
at year end december  and  the company had gross loan concentrations greater than of capital in the following industries as of december  dollars in thousands hotels motels   retail centers   restaurants   convenience gasoline stations   apartment buildings   grocery stores  the contractual maturity ranges of the commercial and industrial and real estate portfolio and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates and floating rates in each maturity range as of december  are summarized in the following table as of december  after one year one through after or less five years five years total dollars in thousands commercial and industrial     real estate mortgage residential    commercial     real estate construction residential    commercial    total     loans with a predetermined interest rate     loans with a floating interest rate     total     effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
under statement no 
 as amended  a loan is considered impaired based on current information and events  if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the loan s observable market price or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the implementation of statement no 
did not have a material adverse affect on the company s financial statements 
nonperforming assets the company believes that it has procedures in place to maintain a high quality loan portfolio 
these procedures include the approval of lending policies and underwriting guidelines by the board of directors  review by an independent internal loan review department  quarterly review by an independent outside loan review company  directors credit committee approval for large credit relationships and loan documentation procedures 
the loan review department reports credit risk grade changes on a monthly basis to management and the board of directors 
the company performs monthly and quarterly concentration analyses based on industries  collateral types  business lines  large credit sizes and officer portfolio loads 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions 
the company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when  in the opinion of management  full payment of loan principal or interest is in doubt 
all loans past due days are placed on nonaccrual status unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection 
cash payments received while a loan is classified as nonaccrual are recorded as a reduction of principal as long as significant doubt exists as to collection of the principal 
otherwise  interest is recognized on a cash basis 
in addition to nonaccrual loans  the company evaluates on an ongoing basis additional loans which are potential problem loans as to risk exposure in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company updates appraisals on loans secured by real estate when loans are renewed  prior to foreclosure and at other times as necessary  particularly in problem loan situations 
in instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses 
the company records other real estate at fair value at the time of acquisition less estimated costs to sell 
versus nonperforming assets at december  and were million and million  respectively 
included in the nonperforming assets are the portions guaranteed by the sba  occgf and ex im bank  which totaled million for nonperforming assets for the year ended december  increased by million or  to million  from million at year end the increase was due to the addition of eight loans to nonaccrual status because they were either days or more past due or an extraordinary event had occurred 
of these eight loans  one has been paid off and two have been brought to current status

included in the nonperforming assets are the portions guaranteed by the sba  occgf and ex im bank  which totaled million for the increases in nonperforming assets for the years ended december  and  were million or and  or  respectively

management has established an allowance for loan losses which it believes is adequate for estimated losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses to the company s board of directors  indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making its evaluation  management considers the diversification by industry of the company s commercial loan portfolio  the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values  the results of recent regulatory examinations  the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers  the amount of charge offs for the period  the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security and the evaluation of its loan portfolio by the independent third party loan review function 
charge offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible in whole or in part 
the company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio 
through the loan review process  the company maintains an internally classified loan list which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize recoverability of the debt 
loans classified as doubtful are those loans which have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that a loss may occur  or at least a portion of the loan may require a charge off if liquidated at present 
although loans classified as substandard do not duplicate loans classified as doubtful  both substandard and doubtful loans include some loans that are delinquent at least days or on nonaccrual status 
loans classified as loss are those loans which are in the process of being charged off 
in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  the company maintains a separate watch list which further aids the company in monitoring loan portfolios 
watch list loans show warning elements where the present status portrays one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short term or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all of the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
the company reviews these loans to assist in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in order to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management establishes specific allowances for loans which management believes require reserves greater than those allocated according to their classification or the delinquent status of specific loans 
management then considers the risk classification or delinquency status of the remaining portfolio and other factors  such as collateral value  portfolio composition  trends in economic conditions and the financial strength of borrowers 
the company then charges to operations a provision for loan losses to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level determined by the foregoing methodology 
beginning in december  in accordance with the aicpa s audit and accounting guide for banks and savings institutions  the company allocates the allowance for loan losses according to management s assessments of risk inherent in the portfolio

at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
the company does not have a trading account 
investments not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity until realized 
the following table presents the amortized cost of securities classified as available for sale and their approximate fair values as of the dates shown as of december  as of december  gross gross gross gross amortized unrealized unrealized fair amortized unrealized unrealized cost gain loss value cost gain loss dollars in thousands us treasury us    us government agency us     municipal securities    other securities    total securities      fair value us treasury us  us government agency us  municipal securities  other securities  total securities  the following table presents the amortized cost of securities classified as held to maturity and their approximate fair values as of the dates shown as of december  as of december  gross gross gross gross amortized unrealized unrealized fair amortized unrealized unrealized cost gain loss value cost gain loss dollars in thousands us government agency us    municipal securities    total securities    fair value us government agency us  municipal securities  total securities  the following table summarizes the contractual maturity of investment securities at amortized cost including federal funds sold and other temporary investments and their weighted average yields

these securities are deemed to have high credit ratings  and certain minimum levels of regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest are guaranteed by the issuing agencies 
included in the company s mortgage backed securities at years ended december  and  were million and million in agency issued collateral mortgage obligations 
as of the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of the mortgage backed securities held by the company had final maturities of more than ten years 
however  unlike us treasury and us government agency securities  which have a lump sum payment at maturity  mortgage backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities 
mortgage backed securities which are purchased at a premium will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because homeowners tend to refinance their mortgages 
thus  the premium paid must be amortized over a shorter period 
therefore  securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment 
as interest rates rise  the opposite will generally be true 
during a period of increasing interest rates  fixed rate mortgage backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently  the average life of this security will not be unduly shortened 
at december  approximately million of the company s mortgage backed securities earn interest at floating rates and reprice within one year  and accordingly are less susceptible to declines in value should interest rates increase 
derivatives as of december   the company had entered into an interest rate swap in an effort to match the repricing of its liabilities with its assets 
the swap has a notional amount of million 
the company pays a floating interest rate of libor less five basis points and receives a fixed rate of 
the swap matures in as of december   the company did not have any off balance sheet derivative contracts outstanding 
however  in and the securities portfolio did contain some securities with options callable by the issuers 
in a declining rate environment  the likelihood that these options will be called may increase 
deposits the company s lending and investing activities are funded principally by deposits  approximately of which were demand  savings and money market deposits at december  average noninterest bearing deposits at december  were million compared with million at year end  an increase of million or 
approximately of average deposits for the year ended december  were noninterest bearing 
total deposits at december  were million  an increase of million or from million at december  average total deposits during increased by to million 
average total deposits during increased to million from million in  an increase of million or 
the increases during and resulted primarily from the opening of new deposit gathering branches and the sale of certificates of deposit in established branches 
the company s ratios of average noninterest bearing demand deposits to average total deposits for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
as part of its effort to cross sell its products and services  the company actively solicits time deposits from existing customers 
in addition  the company receives time deposits from government municipalities and utility districts as well as from corporations seeking to place deposits in minority owned businesses  such as the company 
these time deposits typically renew at maturity and have provided a stable base of time deposits 
unlike other financial institutions  where large time deposits are often considered volatile  the company believes that based on its historical experience its large time deposits have core type characteristics 
it has been the company s experience that  generally  asian customers and customers near retirement age have a higher proportion of savings in time deposits than in other investment vehicles because of the security provided by fdic insurance 
in pricing its time deposits  the company seeks to be competitive but typically prices near the middle of a given market

the loans bear interest at the average rate of per annum until the fifth anniversary of the loans  at which time the loans may be repaid or the interest rate may be renegotiated 
other short term borrowings principally consist of us treasury tax note option accounts and have a maturity of days or less 
additionally  the company had several unused  unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks totaling million at december  and million at each of december  and the following table presents the categories of other borrowings by the company as of december  dollars in thousands fhlb short term loans on december    average during the year   maximum month end balance during the year    fhlb notes on december    average during the year    maximum month end balance during the year    other short term borrowings on december average during the year maximum month end balance during the year  the average rate paid and the weighted average rate paid on other borrowings as of december  was and  respectively

the company manages its sensitivity position within established guidelines 
interest rate risk is managed by the asset and liability committee alco which is composed of directors and senior officers of the company  in accordance with policies approved by the company s board of directors 
the alco formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  the alco considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates  potential changes in interest rates  regional economies  liquidity  business strategies and other factors 
the alco meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activities  commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings 
additionally  the alco reviews liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk i an analysis of relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and ii an interest rate shock simulation model 
the company has traditionally managed its business to reduce its overall exposure to changes in interest rates  however  under current policies of the company s board of directors  management has been given some latitude to increase the company s interest rate sensitivity position within certain limits if  in management s judgment  it will enhance profitability 
as a result  changes in market interest rates may have a greater impact on the company s financial performance in the future than they have had historically 
the company manages its exposure to interest rates by structuring its balance sheet in the ordinary course of business 
the company has not entered into instruments such as leveraged derivatives  structured notes  caps  floors  financial options  financial futures contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk 
during  the company entered into an interest rate swap 
the company pays a floating interest rate of libor less five basis points and receives a fixed rate of 
the swap matures in an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
the management of interest rate risk is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in interest rates 
a company is considered to be asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a company is considered to be liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
the following table sets forth an interest rate sensitivity analysis for the company at december  volumes subject to repricing within greater than days days days years years years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets securities         total loans         federal funds sold and other temporary investments   total interest earning assets         interest bearing liabilities demand  money market and savings deposits     time deposits        federal funds purchased   other borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities        period gap         cumulative gap        period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities the preceding table provides company management with repricing data within given time frames 
the purpose of this information is to assist management in the elements of pricing and of matching interest sensitive assets with interest sensitive liabilities within time frames 
the table indicates a positive gap on a cumulative basis for the three time periods covering the next days of million  million and million  respectively 
with this condition  the company is susceptible to a decrease in net interest income should market interest rates decrease 
the company is aware of this imbalance and has initiated strategies to lower the positive gap by emphasizing the origination of fixed rate loans while shortening the terms of fixed rate liability products 
gap reflects a one day position that is continually changing and is not indicative of the company s position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates solely on that measure  without accounting for alterations in the maturity or repricing characteristics of the balance sheet that occur during changes in market interest rates 
for example  the gap position reflects only the prepayment assumptions pertaining to the current rate environment 
assets tend to prepay more rapidly during periods of declining interest rates than during periods of rising interest rates 
because of this and other risk factors not contemplated by the gap position  an institution could have a matched gap position in the current rate environment and still have its net interest income exposed to increased rate risk 
the company s rate committee and the alco review the company s interest rate risk position on a weekly and monthly basis  respectively 
as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility  primarily in the prime lending rate 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which have a short term to maturity 
based upon the nature of the company s operations  the company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk 
the company does not own any trading assets 
the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the alco 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income 
management realizes certain risks are inherent  and that the goal is to identify  monitor and accept the risks 
the company applies an economic value of equity eve methodology to gauge its interest rate risk exposure as derived from its simulation model 
generally  eve is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning assets and other investments and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk by measuring the change in the eve that would result from a theoretical instantaneous and sustained basis point shift in market interest rates 
presented below  as of december   is an analysis of the company s interest rate risk as measured by changes in eve for parallel shifts of basis points in market interest rates eve as a of present value of assets change in eve change in rates dollars in thousands change in eve eve ratio change bp bp bp bp  bp the percentage change in eve as a result of a basis point decrease in interest rates at december  was compared with as of december  the percentage change in eve as a result of a basis point increase in interest rates on december  of was six basis points less than the change as of december  the company has attempted to narrow the bands of extremes in the investment portfolio s performance acknowledging that some earnings opportunities must be allowed to pass in the interest of minimizing extreme losses during periods of volatile interest rates 
during the third and fourth quarters of  increasing interest rates caused increased prepayment speeds in the company s mortgage backed securities as well as accelerating call activity in us government agency fixed income securities 
as a result of a shift in investment philosophy combined with calls and increased prepayments  management has been able to restructure the portfolio and reduce the negative convexity 
the company s eve is most directly affected by the convexity and duration of its investment portfolio 
the duration and negative convexity of the company s investment portfolio produce disproportionate effects on the value of the portfolio with changes in interest rates 
convexity measures the percentage of portfolio price appreciation or depreciation relative to a decrease or increase in interest rates 
the higher the negative convexity  the greater the decline in the value of a fixed income security as interest rates increase 
the company s investment portfolio is primarily comprised of long term  fixed income securities  the value of which would be adversely affected in a rising interest rate environment 
management believes that the eve methodology overcomes three shortcomings of the typical maturity gap methodology 
first  it does not use arbitrary repricing intervals and accounts for all expected future cash flows 
second  because the eve method projects cash flows of each financial instrument under different interest rate environments  it can incorporate the effect of embedded options on an institution s interest rate risk exposure 
third  it allows interest rates on different instruments to change by varying amounts in response to a change in market interest rates  resulting in more accurate estimates of cash flows 
as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  however  there are certain shortcomings inherent to the eve methodology 
the model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  rate changes are rarely instantaneous 
the use of the simplifying assumption that short term and long term rates change by the same degree may also misstate historical rate patterns which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts 
further  the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or repricing will react identically to changes in rates 
in reality  the market value of certain types of financial instruments may adjust in anticipation of changes in market rates  while any adjustment in the valuation of other types of financial instruments may lag behind the change in general market rates 
additionally  the eve methodology does not reflect the full impact of contractual restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans 
when interest rates change  actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from time deposits may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model 
finally  this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on the ability of adjustable rate loan clients to service their debt 
all of these factors are considered in monitoring the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the prime rate in effect for december  and december  was and  respectively 
management believes that in the short term the prime rate will continue an upward trend 
liquidity liquidity involves the company s ability to raise funds to support asset growth or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s liquidity needs are met primarily by financing activities  which consist mainly of growth in time deposits  supplemented by available investment securities held for sale  other borrowings and earnings through operating activities 
although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities  the company does not generally rely on these external funding sources 
the cash and federal funds sold position  supplemented by amortizing investments along with payments and maturities within the loan portfolio  have historically created an adequate liquidity position 
the company uses federal funds purchased and other borrowings as funding sources and in its management of interest rate risk 
federal funds purchased generally represent overnight borrowings 
other borrowings principally consist of us treasury tax note option accounts that have maturities of days or less and borrowings from the fhlb 
fhlb advances may be utilized from time to time as either a short term funding source or a longer term funding source 
fhlb advances can be particularly attractive as a longer term funding source to balance interest rate sensitivity and reduce interest rate risk 
the company is eligible for several borrowing programs through the fhlb 
the first  a short term borrowing program  requires delivery of eligible securities for collateral 
maturities under this program range from one to days 
at year end  the company had million in borrowings under this program 
the company currently maintains some of its investment securities in safekeeping at the fhlb of dallas 
under another borrowing program  long term borrowings are available to the company from the fhlb 
these borrowings have maturities greater than one year and are collateralized first by fhlb stock  second by the company s one to four family mortgage loans and third by the company s investment securities in safekeeping at the fhlb 
borrowings secured by the company s one to four family mortgage loans are limited to of the loan value 
at december   the company had million in borrowings under this program 
capital resources capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations 
the company is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the federal reserve board and the bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the occ 
both the federal reserve board and the occ have adopted risk based capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy 
these standards define capital and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and off balance sheet exposure  adjusted for credit risk 
the risk based capital standards currently in effect are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among bank holding companies and banks  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate relative risk weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the risk based capital standards of the federal reserve board require all bank holding companies to have tier capital of at least and total risk based capital tier and tier of at least of total risk adjusted assets 
tier capital generally includes common shareholders equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock together with related surpluses and retained earnings  less deductions for goodwill and various other intangibles 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of intermediate term preferred stock  a limited amount of term subordinated debt  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  perpetual preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  and a limited amount of the general valuation allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the federal reserve board has also adopted guidelines which supplement the risk based capital guidelines with a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets leverage ratio of for institutions with well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and that are generally considered to be strong banking organizations  rated composite under applicable federal guidelines  and that are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
other banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to 
these rules further provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels and comparable to peer group averages  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
pursuant to fdicia  each federal banking agency revised its risk based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities  as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multifamily mortgages 
the bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the occ that are substantially similar to the federal reserve board s guidelines 
also pursuant to fdicia  the occ has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution such as the bank would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the bank is classified well capitalized for purposes of the occ s prompt corrective action regulations 
see business supervision and regulation the company and the bank 
shareholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily the result of net income of million offset by dividends paid of million and unrealized losses on securities of million

year compliance general the year risk involves computer programs and computer software that are not able to perform without interruption into and during the year if computer systems do not correctly recognize the date change from december  to january  or do not correctly recognize certain other date changes during the year  computer applications that rely on the date field could fail or create erroneous results 
such erroneous results could affect interest  payment or due dates or cause the temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
if the company  its suppliers  and its borrowers do not address these issues  there could be a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
state of readiness the company formally initiated its year project and plan in november to ensure that its operational and financial systems would not be adversely affected by year problems 
the company formed a year project team and the board of directors and management supported all compliance efforts and allocated the necessary resources to ensure completion 
an inventory of all systems and products including both information technology it and non informational technology non it systems that could have been affected by the year date change was developed  verified and categorized as to its importance to the company and an assessment of all major it and critical non it systems was completed 
this assessment involved inputting into it systems test data which simulates the year date change and reviewing the system output for accuracy 
the company s assessment of critical non it systems involved reviewing such systems to determine whether they were date dependent 
based on such assessment  the company believes that none of its critical non it systems are date dependent 
the software for the company s systems is provided through service bureaus and software vendors 
the company contacted all of its third party vendors and software providers and required them to demonstrate and represent that the products provided would be year compliant and a program of testing compliance was planned 
the company s service bureau  which performs substantially all of the company s data processing functions  warranted in writing that its software was year compliant and pursuant to applicable regulatory guidelines  the company reviewed the results of user group tests performed by the service provider to verify this assertion 
in addition  during the first quarter of  the company began performing all data processing functions in house 
the data processing software purchased by the company is the same software that was used by the company in its vendor provided system 
risks related to third parties the impact of year noncompliance by third parties with which the company transacts business cannot be accurately gauged 
the company identified its largest dollar deposit aggregate deposits over  and loan  or more customers and  based on information available to the company  conducted a preliminary evaluation to determine which of those customers were likely to be affected by year issues 
the company then surveyed those customers deemed at risk to determine their readiness with respect to year issues  including their awareness of year issues  plans to address such issues and progress with respect to such plans 
the survey included approximately of all depositors with balances of  or greater and all of its borrowers of  or more 
the responses indicated that customers were aware of year issues  were in the process of updating their systems and had informed the company that they believe they would be ready for the year date change by the end of to the extent a problem was identified  the company monitored the customer s progress in resolving such problem 
in the event that year noncompliance adversely affects a borrower  the company may be required to charge off the loan to that borrower 
for a discussion of possible effects of such charge offs  see contingency plans below 
with respect to its borrowers  the company includes in its loan documents a year disclosure form as an addendum to the loan agreement in which the borrower represents and warrants its year compliance to the company 
with respect to depositors  the company had additional cash on hand to handle any unusual withdrawal activity 
transition into the year the company suffered no failures in any system or product upon the date change from december  to january  in addition  management is not aware of any vendor or provider used by the company for data processing or related services which experienced a material failure of its product or service due to a year related problem 
the company is also subject to risks associated with year noncompliance by its customers 
management is not aware of any customer which suffered losses related to a year problem which would adversely affect that customer s financial condition or its ability to repay any outstanding loan it has from the company 
costs of compliance the company budgeted  to address year issues 
as of march   the company s expenses did not exceed the amount budgeted 
while the company believes that it will incur no additional material expenses related to the year issue  there can be no assurance that the company will not be impacted by a year related problem which occurs after the date hereof or by the failure of a third party to achieve proper year compliance 
ongoing plans although many of the critical dates related to potential year related problems have passed  experts predict that year related failures could occur throughout the year  such as on february  and december  accordingly  the company s year project team will continue to monitor the company s it and non it systems and attempt to identify any potential problems during the course of the year 
in addition  the company will continue to monitor the year compliance of the third parties with which the company transacts business 
contingency plans the company continues to maintain its contingency plans with respect to year related issues and believes that if its own systems should fail  the company could convert to a manual entry system for a period of up to six months without significant losses 
the company believes that any mission critical systems could be recovered and operating within seven days 
in the event that the federal reserve bank of dallas is unable to handle electronic funds transfers  the company does not expect the impact to be material to its financial condition or results of operations as long as the company is able to utilize an alternative electronic funds transfer source 
as part of its contingency planning  the company reviewed its loan customer base and the potential impact on capital of year noncompliance 
based upon such review  using what it considers to be a reasonable worst case scenario  the company assumed that certain of its commercial borrowers whose businesses are most likely to be affected by year noncompliance would be unable to repay their loans  resulting in charge offs of loan amounts in excess of collateral values 
if such were the case  the company believes that it is unlikely that its exposure would exceed  although there are no assurances that this amount will not be substantially higher 
the company does not believe that this amount is material enough for the company to adjust its current methodology for making provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income which establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in an entity s financial statements 
this statement requires that an enterprise i classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and ii display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income as a separate component in the equity section of a statement of financial position 
this statement is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required 
the adoption of statement no

under the standard  all derivatives must be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or liabilities in the financial condition 
in addition  hedge accounting should only be provided for transactions that meet certain specified criteria 
the accounting for changes in fair value gains and losses of a derivative is dependent on the intended use of the derivative and its designation 
derivatives may be used to hedge exposure to change the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a from commitment  referred to as a fair value hedge  hedge exposure to variable cash flow of forecasted transactions  referred to as cash flow hedge  or hedge foreign currency exposure
