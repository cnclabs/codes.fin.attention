item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general felcor is one of the nation s largest hotel reit s 
at december   it owned interests in hotels with nearly  rooms and suites through its greater than equity interest in the operating partnership 
additional organizational information relating to the company  and the definitions of certain capitalized terms  are contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements of felcor lodging trust incorporated appearing elsewhere herein 
the company is the owner of the largest number of embassy suites r  crowne plaza r  holiday inn r and independently owned doubletree r branded hotels in the world 
the hotels are located in states and canada with concentrations in texas  california  florida and georgia hotels 
the following table provides a schedule of the hotels  by brand  operated by each of the company s lessees at december  not operated brand djont bristol under a lease total embassy suites holiday inn doubletree and doubletree guest suites r crowne plaza and crowne plaza suites r holiday inn select r sheraton r and sheraton suites r hampton inn r holiday inn express r fairfield inn r harvey hotel r independents courtyard by marriott r hilton suites r homewood suites r four points by sheraton r westin r total hotels on january  two of these doubletree guest suites hotels were converted to the embassy suites brand 
on january  a lease on this hotel became effective between the company and djont 
the principal factors affecting the company s results of operations are changes in room and suite revenues reflected by revenue per available room revpar  renovations  redevelopments  and rebrandings of hotels and acquisitions 
on july   the company completed the acquisition of the real estate assets of bristol hotel company through the merger  which resulted in the net addition of hotels  valued at approximately billion  to the company s portfolio 
in addition to the assets acquired in the merger  the company acquired ownership interests in hotels in and one additional hotel in nine of the hotels acquired in the merger did not meet the company s investment criteria  and were sold in and in  the company completed the major portion of its program of renovation  redevelopment  and rebranding of hotels  undertaken to improve under performing assets and increase revenues 
the company and  prior to the merger  bristol hotel company  spent nearly million in on renovations  redevelopments  rebrandings  room additions to existing hotels  and other hotel improvements 
in the company completed renovations at hotels during the year  totaling million 
nineteen hotels were undergoing renovation at the end of and renovation expenditures on the hotel portfolio totaled million during the year 
a total of eight hotels were rebranded during on january   two doubletree guest suites hotels were rebranded as embassy suites hotels 
management believes that its strategy of renovating  redeveloping and rebranding selected hotels continues to be effective in improving revenue performance 
historically the company has been financed primarily with equity  resulting in a conservative financial structure 
the company s emphasis on maintaining this conservative approach is evidenced in part  by the following  as of december  o interest coverage ratio of x o total debt to annual ebitda of x o borrowing capacity under its line of credit of million o consolidated debt equal to of its investment in hotels at cost o fixed interest rate debt comprising of total debt o secured mortgage debt to total assets of o debt of approximately million maturing in felcor s historical results of operations for   and are summarized as follows in millions  except percentages and hotel counts years ended december  percentage change vs vs hotels owned at year end revenues income before nonrecurring items net income applicable to common shareholders funds from operations ffo results of operations the company actual comparison of the years ended december  and for the years and  felcor had total revenue of million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of percentage lease revenue of million and million 
the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the company s acquisition and subsequent leasing  pursuant to percentage leases  of interests in more than hotels in  including the hotels that were acquired through the merger on july  the hotels which were acquired during  including those acquired through the merger  accounted for million of the change in percentage lease revenue for the twelve months ended december  compared to the hotels owned throughout both of the years ended december  and produced an increase in percentage lease revenues of million or between and changes in room and suite revenues significantly affect the company because its principal source of revenue is rent payments from the lessees under the percentage leases 
the percentage leases provide for rent based on a percentage of room and suite revenue  food and beverage revenue  food and beverage rents  and in some instances  other hotel revenues 
in and  percentage lease revenue derived from room and suite revenue represented and of total percentage lease revenue  respectively 
the hotels owned throughout both and increased room and suite revenue by million or in compared to and increased revpar by 
the revpar increase was driven by an increase in average daily rate adr of  despite a slight drop in occupied rooms occupancy of percentage points 
of the hotels  had undergone renovation in either or those renovated hotels reflected increases in adr of and in revpar of  which was greater than the results for hotels that had not undergone renovation 
this reflects both the improvement from renovation and the impact of taking rooms out of service for such renovation 
the company generally seeks to improve those of its hotels that management believes can achieve increases in room and suite revenue and revpar as a result of renovation  redevelopment and rebranding 
however  during the course of such improvements hotel revenue performance is often adversely affected  compared to the prior year  by such temporary factors as rooms and suites out of service and disruptions of hotel operations 
during  felcor spent million on the renovation  redevelopment and rebranding of its hotels 
as a result of the extensive renovations  felcor s portfolio experienced significant disruption during  with approximately  room nights out of service  or of its portfolio 
a more detailed discussion of hotel room and suite revenue is contained in the the hotels actual section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
total expenses increased million in the year ended december   to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from the additional hotels acquired in july through the merger 
total expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to for the twelve months ended december   compared to in the same period of the major components of the increase in expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  are depreciation  land leases  and interest expense 
depreciation increased  as a percentage of total revenue  to in the twelve months ended december   from in the relative increase in depreciation expense is primarily attributed to depreciation on million in capital expenditures made over the past two years  approximately of which are short lived assets that are depreciated over to years 
land lease expenses represent of total revenue in as compared to in this increase  as a percentage of total revenue  results primarily from the larger percentage of hotels subject to land leases among those acquired through the merger 
interest expense increased  as a percentage of total revenue  to in the twelve months ended december   from in this increase in interest expense is attributed to the increased debt used to finance renovations  higher interest rates on debt that was refinanced to extend maturities and convert such debt from variable to fixed rates  the assumption of debt related to the more highly leveraged bristol assets  and borrowings to fund the company s stock repurchase program 
general and administrative expenses and taxes  insurance and other expense remained relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in and comparison of the years ended december  and for the years and  felcor had total revenue of million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of percentage lease revenue of million and million 
the hotels owned by the company throughout both of the years and  which reflect the effect of the company s ownership and the management by its strategic partners  experienced a growth in revpar during of over the largest portion of this increase came from the former crown sterling suite hotels  which continued their trend of improved revpar throughout  achieving a revpar of in compared to for  an increase of 
these hotels have improved their revpar performance by since the company attributes this dramatic increase to the renovation  redevelopment and rebranding of these hotels in and early total expenses increased million in over  primarily resulting from the net acquisition of hotels during and hotels in total expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased in to from in the major component of the increase in expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  was interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  from million in to million in  and increased as a percentage of total revenue  from in to in the relative increase in interest expense is attributed to the assumption of debt related to the more highly leveraged bristol assets 
debt as a percentage of total assets increased from at december  to at december  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  and taxes  insurance and other expenses remained relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in and funds from operations the company considers funds from operations to be a key measure of a reit s performance which should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income and cash flow as a measure of the company s operating performance and liquidity 
the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines funds from operations as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and extraordinary gains or losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
the company believes that funds from operations is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of the ability of the company to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
the company computes funds from operations in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
funds from operations may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions and other commitments and uncertainties 
the following table details the computation of funds from operations in thousands years ended december  funds from operations ffo net income    series b preferred share dividends   extraordinary charge from write off of deferred financing fees

as a result of the renovation and rebranding of hotels  approximately of percentage lease revenue for is expected to be derived from upscale and full service hotels 
the company believes that when analyzing the performance of the hotels  looking at comparable hotels is the most meaningful 
the company defines comparable hotels as those not undergoing renovation  redevelopment or rebranding in either of the comparison years 
major renovations generally have an adverse affect on hotel earnings by taking rooms out of service and disrupting hotel operations 
non comparable hotels are those undergoing renovation  redevelopment or rebranding during either year 
the following table sets forth historical occupancy  adr and revpar at december  and  and the percentage changes therein between the years presented for the hotels in which the company had an ownership interest at december  this information is presented regardless of the date of acquisition

comparison of the hotels operating statistics for the years ended december  and for the twelve months ended december   the company s comparable hotels revpar increased  compared to the same period in  by 
in the twelve months ended december   the comparable hotels adr increased  but occupancy fell percentage points 
in general  the company is encouraged by the relative firming of room rates in the last half of the year  which appears to be indicative of the absorption of the new rooms introduced in certain markets during the past year 
the djont comparable hotels are predominately embassy suites  doubletree and doubletree guest suites  and sheraton hotels 
the bristol comparable hotels are predominately holiday inn and crowne plaza hotels 
the following table shows the comparable hotel revpar changes for these five brands for the year ended december   compared to revpar percentage of total change room revenue embassy suites hotels holiday inn hotels sheraton hotels doubletree hotels crowne plaza hotels the poor performance of the comparable crowne plaza hotels is primarily the result of one hotel in jackson  mississippi  which was converted to a crowne plaza in this hotel suffered both significant competition from a new full service hotel and the relocation of a major employer that had contributed significant business in prior years 
the comparable embassy suites and holiday inn hotels showed improving revpar trends in the last half of  which appear to be continuing into nearly of the company s comparable hotel revenue was derived from four states texas  california  georgia and florida 
changes in comparable hotel revpar during for these states  compared to  are illustrated in the following table revpar percentage of total change room revenue texas hotels california hotels georgia hotels florida hotels felcor s exposure in overbuilt markets  such as dallas  texas  had a negative impact on comparable hotel trends during  although management expects the rate of new supply additions to decline in during  the company s texas hotels experienced a decrease in revpar  while the comparable hotels in the dallas market experienced a decline in revpar 
management is encouraged  although it continues to see an oversupply in the dallas market  that the situation appears to be improving and supply growth is now expected to begin a gradual decline 
in addition  the company has recently renovated eight of its dallas based properties and management is currently projecting positive revpar growth for the majority of its hotels in this market during the non comparable hotel performance was most profoundly affected by the allerton crowne plaza  which was closed for renovation in the third quarter and partially reopened in the second quarter of the allerton generated an increase in its revpar for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in the remainder of the bristol non comparable hotels also showed improvements in revpar  which are attributed to the completion of renovations at many of these hotels 
most of the djont non comparable hotels where renovations had been completed also showed strong revpar increases for the year  compared to the same period last year 
other factors which management believes will have favorable impacts on future hotel revenues are the recent merger between hilton hotels corporation and promus hotel corporation and the recently announced merger agreement between bristol and bass plc 
the hilton promus merger  which was completed in november  should provide stability and focus for the embassy suites and doubletree brands 
in addition  the promus brands should benefit from the distribution of the hilton brands in the united states and worldwide  cross selling through the larger hilton promus reservation system and the addition of hilton s hhonors r frequent traveler and loyalty program to the company s embassy suites and doubletree hotels 
the proposed bass bristol merger will serve to match the management of the company s bass branded hotels with the brand owner  which management expects to be beneficial to the development and strengthening of these brands and should help strengthen the company s relationship with the brand owner 
djont actual comparison of the years ended december  and total revenues increased to million in the twelve months ended december   from million in the same period of  an increase of 
total revenues consisted primarily of room and suite revenue of million and million in the twelve months of and  respectively 
the increase in total revenues is primarily a result of the acquisition of twelve additional hotels in room and suite revenues from the these hotels  for the twelve months ended december  over  increased or million 
the room and suite revenue for the hotels which were leased for all of and  increased million as a result of an increase in adr of  with a slight decrease in occupancy of 
the embassy suites and doubletree branded hotels  collectively hotels  should benefit from the recently completed merger between hilton hotels corporation and promus hotel corporation the brand manager for all but two of djont s embassy suites and doubletree hotels 
hilton s upscale hotel experience and integration into hilton s central reservation system  marketing infrastructure and frequent stay program have the potential to drive both incremental occupancy and rate 
djont s income before percentage lease rent decreased as a percentage of total revenues from in the twelve months ended december  to in the twelve months ended december  for the twelve months ended december   djont incurred losses of million 
this was largely due to higher labor costs and related payroll benefits  increased reservation costs  and increased fees related to the former crown sterling suite hotels 
percentage lease expense remained relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in and comparison of the years ended december  and total revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
total revenues consisted primarily of suite revenue of million and million in and  respectively 
percentage lease expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased 
the increase in total revenues is primarily a result of the increase in the number of hotels leased to hotels at december  from hotels at december  suite revenues for the hotels which were leased for all of and increased or million 
the increase in revenues at these hotels is due primarily to improved average daily room rates of for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  djont recorded a net income of  in compared to a net loss of million in this improvement in operating performance is primarily attributed to improved profitability of food and beverage operations for djont and a decrease in percentage lease expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
food and beverage profits increased to of total revenue in from in  an increase of million 
this change is attributed to the increased number of hotels leased by djont which have a greater emphasis on food and beverage than the traditional embassy suites hotel 
food and beverage revenue  as a percentage of total revenue  increased to in compared to in percentage lease expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to from 
a portion of this change is attributed to the increase in food and beverage revenues  as a percentage of total revenues  which bear a lower percentage rent than room revenues 
renovations  redevelopments and rebrandings the company has historically differentiated itself from many of its competitors by o the practice of upgrading  renovating and or redeveloping most of its acquired hotels to enhance their competitive position  and  in certain instances  rebranding them to improve their revenue generating capacity  and o the ongoing program for the maintenance of the company s upgraded hotel assets  which includes o the contribution of at least of annual room and suite revenue for the djont hotels  and of total annual hotel revenue for the bristol hotels  for routine capital replacements and improvements  and o ensuring the lessees adherence to a maintenance and repair program amounting to approximately of annual hotel revenues 
renovation and redevelopment program the company has demonstrated its ability to successfully execute renovations 
its renovation and rebranding of the crown sterling suites hotels  which were acquired during and  achieved an overall revpar increase of between and during and  an aggregate of approximately million in capital improvements were made to the company s hotels  with approximately of total hotel room nights being lost due to renovation in and in during  the company currently expects to spend approximately million on the renovation of hotels  approximately million to complete renovations started in at hotels  and approximately million for other capital expenditures 
the company is currently reviewing the feasibility of undertaking between and million of additional renovations and room additions during the company currently expects an insignificant number of room nights to be lost during as a result of renovations 
by the end of  the company will have spent nearly million since on renovations and other capital expenditures to its hotel portfolio  which should limit the need for future renovation expenditures primarily to those necessary to maintain the hotels in their upgraded condition 
the largest single renovation project completed during was the allerton crowne plaza in chicago  which was partially reopened in july  after having been closed for more than a year 
this project has received numerous awards  including lodging hospitality magazine s year s best design competition in two categories  bass hotels resorts newcomer of the year award  and chicago s greater north michigan avenue association avenue enhancement award

they are located in troy  michigan  and near the baltimore washington international airport in linthicum  maryland 
room additions during  the company completed construction of an aggregate of suites at its embassy suites hotels in jacksonville and orlando north  florida  and new orleans  louisiana 
in early  the company expects to complete construction on a room addition to its doubletree hotel in wilmington  delaware 
capital reserve it is the company s policy to contribute a minimum of of room and suite revenue from the djont leased hotels and of total hotel revenue from the bristol leased hotels to a capital reserve account in order to provide funds for necessary ongoing capital replacements and improvements 
during  approximately million was spent on such replacements and improvements which is in addition to the million spent under the renovation and redevelopment program described above 
repairs and maintenance during the year ended december   approximately million and million were spent by the lessees on routine repairs and maintenance at the hotels leased by djont and bristol  respectively 
this represents approximately of total hotel revenues 
liquidity and capital resources felcor s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to shareholders and repayments of indebtedness  is its share of the operating partnership s cash flow from the percentage leases 
for the year ended december   cash flow provided by operating activities  consisting primarily of percentage lease revenue  was million and funds from operations was million 
the lessees obligations under the percentage leases are largely unsecured 
the lessees have limited capital resources and  accordingly  their ability to make lease payments under the percentage leases is substantially dependent on the ability of the lessees to generate sufficient cash flow from the operation of the hotels 
at december   the lessees had paid all amounts then due the company under the percentage leases 
djont recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december  because of the current year loss and losses in prior years  djont s accumulated deficit totaled million at december  the losses in the current year are attributed to weaker than anticipated revenues in and lower operating margins 
a significant portion of prior year losses are attributable to the operation of hotels during periods of substantial renovation 
management anticipates modest revenue growth at the djont hotels during  which may result in additional operating losses 
management anticipates that djont will be able to generate profits over the next five years and to significantly reduce the accumulated deficit  as a result of the planned rebranding of one of its hotels  the elimination of certain expenses  and percentage leases that expire and are expected to be renewed with more favorable terms at the time of their expiration 
management believes that the loan commitments from certain entities owning interests in djont and the managers of certain hotels  aggregating approximately million  and improvements in operating margins will be sufficient to enable djont to continue to make necessary payments when due 
it is anticipated that a substantial portion of any future profits of djont will be retained until a positive net worth equity is restored 
the company deems djont to be a viable going concern and  as such  no adjustments are required to the accompanying financial statements 
bristol has entered into an absolute and unconditional guarantee of the obligations of the bristol lessees under the percentage leases 
as an additional credit enhancement  the bristol lessees obtained a letter of credit the letter of credit issued by bankers trust company for the benefit of the company in the original amount of million 
this letter of credit is subject to periodic reductions upon satisfaction of certain conditions and at december  was in the amount of million 
according to bristol s earnings release dated february   for the years ended december  and  bristol had net income of million and million  respectively  and a shareholder s equity of million at december  the company may incur indebtedness to make property acquisitions  to purchase shares of its capital stock or to meet distribution requirements imposed on a reit under the internal revenue code  to the extent that working capital and cash flow from the company s investments are insufficient for such purposes 
at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents and had utilized million under its million revolving line of credit

the line of credit and the senior term loan contain various affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on total indebtedness  total secured indebtedness  and cash distributions  as well as the obligation to maintain a certain minimum tangible net worth and certain minimum interest and debt service coverage ratios 
at december   the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
the company s other borrowings contain affirmative and negative covenants that are generally equal to or less restrictive than the line of credit and senior term loan 
most of the mortgage debt is nonrecourse to the company with certain exceptions and contains provisions allowing for the substitution of collateral upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
most of the mortgage debt is prepayable  subject to various prepayment penalties  yield maintenance  or defeasance obligations 
to provide for additional financing flexibility  the company has approximately million of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  and or common stock warrants available for offerings under shelf registration statements previously declared effective 
on september   felcor announced that its board of directors had authorized the company to repurchase up to million of its outstanding common shares 
at december   the company had completed the repurchase of approximately million common shares at a cost of approximately million  which has been recorded as treasury stock

through march   the company had purchased an aggregate of million common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the company s million in cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended december   relates primarily to the repurchase of approximately million shares of felcor s common stock for approximately million and distributions aggregating million 
these expenditures were partially offset by net borrowings by the company of million during the year 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt 
the company manages the risk of increasing interest rates on its floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps  which effectively convert variable rate debt to a fixed rate  by locking the interest rates paid 
the company had entered into interest rate swap contracts relating to debt of million at december  the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations at december   the table presents scheduled maturities and weighted average interest rates  by maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates  by contractual maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december  the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt indicates the estimated principal amount of debt having the same debt service requirements which could have been borrowed at december  at then current market interest rates 
the fair value of the company s variable to fixed interest rate swaps indicates the estimated amount that would have been received by the company had they been sold at december  expected maturity date in thousands thereafter total fair value liabilities debt fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate       average interest rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps variable to fixed      average pay rate average receive rate swap contracts  such as those described above  contain a credit risk  in that the counterparties may be unable to fulfill the terms of the agreement 
the company minimizes that risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of its counterparties  who are limited to major banks and financial institutions  and does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties 
reit modernization act on december   the provisions of the reit modernization act became law 
these provisions  among other things  will reduce the distribution requirement for reits from of taxable income to of taxable income  effective january  in addition  these provisions will allow reits  subject to certain limitations  to own directly or indirectly up to of the stock of a taxable reit subsidiary trs that can engage in businesses previously prohibited to a reit 
in particular  these provisions will permit a hotel reit to own a trs that can lease hotels from its parent hotel reit  rather than requiring the lessee to be a separate  unaffiliated party 
however  hotels leased to a trs will still have to be managed by an unaffiliated third party 
the provisions are complex and impose several conditions on the use of a trs  generally to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation 
further  no more than of a reit s assets may consist of non qualifying assets  including securities of a trs and other taxable subsidiaries 
these provisions also go into effect on january  however  a taxable subsidiary in existence on july   such as kingston plantation development corp 
kpdc  a corporation of which the company owns of the nonvoting stock  representing of the value of kpdc s outstanding stock  will be grandfathered unless and until it engages in a new line of business or acquires a substantial new asset or the related reit acquires additional stock in the taxable subsidiary 
such existing taxable subsidiaries can be converted into trs s on a tax free basis at any time before january  as a result of these provisions  felcor will be able to form a trs to serve as the lessee for any hotels it acquires after the effective date 
any profit from leases held by the trs  after payment of the applicable corporate tax  will be available for distribution to the reit 
felcor is currently considering formation of a trs to acquire the lessees or all or a portion of their existing hotel leases 
however  numerous issues and potential conflicts of interest will need to be resolved to do so  and there can be no assurance that the company will ultimately acquire any of the existing leases through a trs 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
competitive pressures may  however  limit the lessees ability to raise room rates 
seasonality the hotels operations historically have been seasonal in nature  reflecting higher occupancy rates primarily during the first three quarters of each year 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly lease revenue  particularly during the fourth quarter  to the extent that it receives percentage rent 
to the extent cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenue  the company expects to utilize cash on hand or borrowings under the line of credit to make distributions to its equity holders

sab is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sab requires that a lessor not recognize contingent rental income until annual specified thresholds have been achieved by the lessee 
during  the company s leases had quarterly  rather than annual  specified rental thresholds and the company recognized contingent rentals earned in each quarter pursuant to the percentage lease terms 
the company has reviewed the terms of its percentage leases and has determined that the provisions of sab will not materially impact the company s revenue recognition on an interim basis in  since a significant majority of the percentage leases contain quarterly specified thresholds 
sab will not impact the company s revenue recognition on an annual basis given the company maintains only calendar year leases 
sab will have no impact on the company s interim or annual cash flow from the lessees  and therefore on its ability to pay dividends
