item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview radiance medical systems  inc radiance  or the company develops  manufactures and markets proprietary devices for the prevention of the recurrence of atherosclerotic blockages following the interventional treatment of atherosclerosis 
radiance currently is primarily engaged in conducting research and development on radiation therapy  and its primary product under development is the rdx catheter  a balloon catheter based delivery system designed to deliver radioactive materials to the area of an artery that has been treated with conventional interventional therapy such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca  atherectomy and or stent deployment 
see item products 
the company is the result of an acquisition effected by the merger of the former radiance medical systems  inc rms with and into cvd rms acquisition corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of cardiovascular dynamics  inc now named radiance medical systems  inc from inception march  through the first quarter of  the company s operations were limited and consisted primarily of research and development and other start up activities 
in  the company introduced for sale its angioplasty catheter products 
over the next three years  the company would continue its development and introduction of what would be called its focus technology angioplasty catheter products and introduced its vascular access product line 
while product sales continued to grow into  changes in angioplasty technology  and increasing competition from much larger competitors would necessitate the development of angioplasty devices based upon new technology 
because the company s management believed that radiation therapy technology would produce the next generation of angioplasty catheters  in august of  rms was formed as a separate entity to focus on the development of radiation therapy technology for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and to obtain financing for such development from sources other than the company 
in january  after rms had completed the initial development of the rdx catheter  the company reacquired all of the shares of rms that it did not own as a result of a merger and now concentrates its product development on radiation therapy technology for angioplasty 
radiance has not completed the development of the rdx catheter and currently sells its existing products primarily through medical device distributors 
radiance is a party to three agreements for the us distribution of products incorporating its focus technology 
radiance distributes certain products in japan through an exclusive distribution agreement with cathex 
radiance also has distribution agreements with companies covering countries outside the united states and japan 
see business of radiance strategic relationships 
on july   radiance entered into co distribution agreements with medtronic  providing for the co distribution of radiance s fact  cat and arc balloon angioplasty catheters 
under the terms of these agreements  medtronic purchased a minimum number of angioplasty catheters manufactured by radiance for distribution worldwide for a period of up to three years 
specific products to be distributed by medtronic differed in individual country markets 
the initial term of the medtronic agreements was for a period of three years from the date of first delivery of a product 
in may  medtronic advised radiance of its election to not make minimum purchases of product for the second year of the agreement 
in june  medtronic informed radiance that it would not fulfill its commitment for the first year of the agreement and that it did not believe it was required to fulfill such commitment 
this dispute adversely affected radiance s financial results for the second half of and first half of in june  radiance entered into a technology license agreement with guidant corporation  an international interventional cardiology products company  granting guidant rights to manufacture and distribute products using radiance s focus technology for delivery of stents  including exclusive rights in the united states 
in exchange for those rights radiance has received  and will receive  certain milestone payments based upon the transfer of the technological knowledge to guidant  and royalty payments based upon the sale of products by guidant using focus technology 
in january  the company sold substantially all of the properties and assets used exclusively in its vascular access product line to escalon medical corporation 
the company received an initial payment of million for actual assets transferred  received an additional million upon the completion of the transfer of the assets and technology in october  and also is entitled to receive royalty payments upon the sale of products for a five year period 
during  the company recognized the minimum annual royalty under the sale agreement of approximately million 
the company continued to manufacture certain vascular access products for eleven months following the completion of the sale on a cost plus basis 
in january  the company acquired through a merger all of capital stock which it did not own of the former radiance medical systems  inc rms 
pursuant to the merger  the company paid the former stockholders of rms for each share of rms preferred stock and for each share of rms common stock  for a total consideration of approximately million  excluding the value of rms common stock options to be provided to rms optionholders in exchange for their rms common stock options 
the consideration was paid by delivery of an aggregate of  shares of company common stock  and million in cash to certain rms stockholders who elected cash 
options for  shares of rms common stock accelerated and vested immediately prior to the completion of the merger 
of these   were exercised  and the holders received the same consideration for their shares of rms common stock as other holders of rms common stock 
the options not exercised prior to the completion of the merger were assumed by the company and converted into options at the same exercise price to purchase an aggregate of  share of the company common stock 
in addition  the former rms stockholders and optionholders may receive product development milestone payments of for each share of rms preferred stock and for each share of rms common stock 
one of the milestones  which was scheduled during the second quarter of and extended into the third quarter of  was not met 
as a result  the maximum total of potential milestone payments  before adjustment for early or late achievement of the milestones  is reduced to for each share of preferred stock and for each share of common stock 
the milestone payments may be increased up to  or reduced or eliminated if the milestones are reached earlier or later  respectively  than the milestone target dates 
the milestones represent important steps in the united states food and drug administration and european approval process which the company has determined are critical to bringing the company s technology to the marketplace 
the rms merger consideration was allocated to tangible assets aggregating approximately million acquired and assumed liabilities aggregating approximately million  with the remaining merger consideration being allocated to acquired in process research and development ipr d  developed technology and employment contracts  according to an independent appraisal 
see note in june of  the company granted cosmotec co  ltd 
of japan distribution rights to market its vascular radiation therapy products in japan 
radiance received million as an upfront cash payment and will recognize the revenue ratably over the seven year term of the agreement 
the company recognized million of the aforementioned revenue for the year ended december  radiance will also receive million from cosmotec for a debenture issuable in june  which will be convertible into radiance common stock over the subsequent three year period at an initial conversion price of per share 
as part of the transaction with cosmotec  it was agreed that a joint venture  between the company and an affiliate of cosmotec  would be formed to distribute the company s rdx catheter products in japan 
in august  the company purchased for cash of million a interest in the joint venture  named radiatec 
in july  the company entered into a two year contract manufacturing agreement with bebig gmbh bebig to manufacture its radiation therapy catheter in europe 
according to the agreement  during and  radiance will pay certain facility set up fees  totaling approximately million  and all material and third party costs associated with production validation 
radiance will prepare the manufacturing equipment used to perform the final assembly of the rdx catheter  estimated to cost approximately million  and bebig will purchase the equipment from radiance for million 
radiance will also pay bebig an agreed amount for each unit produced 
for a nominal charge  the company can renew the agreement for three successive  two year terms 
in conjunction with the contract manufacturing agreement  the company entered into a three year sub license agreement for certain radiation technology that it believed may be useful in the development of its radiation therapy products 
there is a minimum annual license fee of million  subject to offset by certain amounts paid under the aforementioned manufacturing agreement  beginning in july and royalty fees for any products sold worldwide that incorporate the licensed technology 
the sub license is subject to renewal  without cost  until the underlying patents expiration dates 
as a result of the closing of clinitec gmbh  the company s german distribution subsidiary  the company reconsidered the initial accounting for the acquisition of this subsidiary in in recording the acquisition  the company accounted for the forgiveness of its account receivable from clinitec for product sales to be a part of its total purchase price  and allocated such amount to goodwill resulting from the business combination 
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company has restated sales to eliminate million in sales to clinitec in that year  since no payment had been received for these sales  and has written off as a bad debt expense in the remaining million clinitec account receivable balance related to sales 
net of related adjustments to cost of sales and amortization expense  the company has increased reported net loss for by million and decreased goodwill by a corresponding amount 
the remaining million balance of the amount originally assigned to goodwill has been treated as an identifiable intangible asset and was amortized over the period ended december  this restatement has no effect on cash flows from operations or other sources or uses of cash 
results of operations years ended december  and december  sales revenue 
sales revenue in decreased to million compared to million for the same period of during  the company reduced its domestic direct sales force and  in june of that year  licensed its focus technology 
in january  it sold its vascular access product line and related assets and acquired rms as the company sought to maximize the value of existing technology  while acquiring a technology which management believes will have greater potential for future product sales 
as a result of the aforementioned license and sale  and increased competition for angioplasty catheter products  sales of focus technology decreased million  from million in to million in  and vascular access products decreased million  from million in to million in the company expects that sales of its existing products will continue to decline in  compared with sales  as its remaining products age  and the licensee s products gain wider regulatory approval and market acceptance 
additionally  there will be no sales of vascular access products in sales of vascular access products totaled approximately million  or of total revenues 
if rdx technology development concludes successfully and we receive regulatory approval for sale in europe in late  the ability of the company to generate product sales in and in the future will be dependent upon many factors  including but not limited to market acceptance  medical reimbursement  competitive products 
see risk factors 
license fee and other revenue 
license fee and other revenue increased from million in to million in in  the company signed a technology license agreement with guidant corporation resulting in million and million in license fees in and  respectively 
additionally  the company recognized million and million in minimum royalties under the sale agreement for the vascular access product line and related assets and the technology license agreement with guidant  respectively  in because there are no more milestone payments due under the aforementioned guidant license agreement or vascular access sale agreement  management anticipates significantly lower license revenue in  compared with however  some reduction in milestone payments should be offset by higher royalty income in  compared with cost of sales 
the cost of sales decreased to million in compared with million in the cost of sales for decreased to compared to of revenues for this decrease was primarily attributable to million from licensing fees received in that had no associated cost of sales and relatively lower product sales compared with the company agreed to produce vascular access products for six months following the sale of the vascular access product line and related assets in january on a cost plus reimbursement basis for the acquiring company and extended that commitment until december thus  the margin that the company earned on sales of such products was substantially lower in compared with management anticipates lower margins on existing products for  compared with  due to increasing competition and lower volume production 
charge for acquired in process research and development 
due to the acquisition of a controlling interest in rms in september  and the acquisition of the remaining shares of rms not owned by the company in january  the company recognized a charge of million and million for acquired in process research and development in and  respectively 
see note intangible assets 
research and development 
research and development expenses  which include clinical expenses  increased by to million for from million in the primary reason for this increase was additional spending on development of and clinical trials for the company s new radiation catheter 
the company believes that the research  development and clinical expenses could be substantially higher in compared with  primarily due to higher costs for the clinical expenses as the european and us clinicals for the rdx catheter began in late third quarter and first quarter  respectively 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses declined to million in  from million in this decrease primarily reflects reductions in the company s domestic and international sales force and related expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to million for from million for the decrease was due primarily to lower bad debt expense in  compared with other income 
interest income declined to million in compared with million in the decrease was due primarily to a reduction of million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during  due to the use of funds for operations  the purchase of treasury stock and capital expenditures 
gain loss on sale of assets increased to million in from million in due mainly to the sale of the assets of the vascular access product line and related assets in january other income expense increased to million income in due primarily to other income from the sale of an option to purchase an investment held by the company

the company did not have any license fees in cost of sales 
the cost of sales increased to million in  compared with million in the cost of sales for decreased to of revenues compared to of revenues for this decrease was primarily attributable to the receipt of the million guidant licensing fees received in that had no associated cost of sales 
charge for acquired in process research and development 
due to the acquisition of a controlling interest in rms  the company recognized a charge of million for acquired in process research and development in see note intangible assets 
research and development 
research and development expenses  which include clinical expenses  increased by to million for  from million in the primary reason for this increase was additional spending on development of the company s new radiation catheter and self expanding arterial lining seal technology and increased spending on clinical trials for these products 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses declined to million in  from million in this decrease primarily reflects reductions in the company s domestic sales force and related expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million for  from million for the increase was due primarily to additions to the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable and the salary expense of an additional executive officer 
other income 
interest income declined to million in compared with million in the decrease was due to a reduction of million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during  due to the use of funds for operations  the purchase of treasury stock and capital expenditures 
radiance has experienced an operating loss for each of the last three years and expects to continue to incur operating losses through at least radiance s results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter 
quarterly operating results depend upon several factors  including the timing and amount of expenses associated with expanding the company s operations  the conduct of clinical trials and the timing of regulatory approvals  new product introductions both in the united states and internationally  the mix between pilot production of new products and full scale manufacturing of existing products  the mix between domestic and export sales  variations in foreign exchange rates  changes in third party payors reimbursement policies and healthcare reform 
the company does not operate with a significant backlog of customer orders  and therefore revenues in any quarter are significantly dependent on orders received within that quarter 
in addition  the company cannot predict ordering rates by distributors  some of whom place infrequent stocking orders 
the company s expenses are relatively fixed and difficult to adjust in response to fluctuation revenues 
as a result of these and other factors  the company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has financed its operations primarily from the sale of its equity securities  advances from endosonics  licensing its technologies and through international product distribution agreements 
prior to the company s initial public offering  the company had raised an aggregate of approximately million from the private sales of preferred and common stock and million in working capital from endosonics  which was repaid to endosonics during the third quarter of in the second quarter of  the company closed its initial public offering of common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses of the offering 
for the years ended december   and  the company s net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in was primarily the result of a decrease in net working capital 
the decrease in was primarily the result of a lower net loss and a decrease in net working capital 
at december   radiance had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale of million 
the company expects to incur substantial costs related to  among other things  clinical testing  product development  marketing and sales expenses  and to utilize increased levels of working capital to finance its accounts receivable and inventories prior to achieving positive cash flow from operations 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund its operations through june  radiance s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including its research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical trials  the regulatory approval process  the costs involved in intellectual property rights enforcement or litigation  competitive products  the establishment of manufacturing capacity  the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities  and the establishment of collaborative relationships with other parties 
the company may need to raise funds through additional financings  including private or public equity offerings and collaborative arrangements with existing or new corporate partners 
there can be no assurance that funds will be raised on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of its development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to grant rights to certain technologies or products that the company would not otherwise grant 
risk factors operating losses  anticipated future losses and future capital requirements 
from our formation in to the date of this filing  we have had substantial annual operating losses and expect to have them at least through  if not longer  due to our continued research and development activities  and expenditures related to clinical testing and product development 
we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  our activities are highly capital intensive 
although we believe that our present capital and anticipated revenues from operations will be sufficient to meet our presently planned capital needs at least through the second quarter of  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional capital during that time or thereafter 
our cash requirements in the future may be significantly different from our current estimates and depend on many factors  including research and development programs  scope and results of clinical trials  time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property  status of competitive products  establishment and scale up of manufacturing capacity  establishment of sales and marketing capabilities  and establishment of collaborative relationships with other parties and costs related to the acquisition of new technologies and product development 
we may require additional funds to finance these activities and for working capital requirements  and may seek such funds through additional rounds of financing  including private or public equity or debt offerings and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners 
in addition  we may be required to undertake significant capital expenditures to achieve and maintain any technological and competitive position in our industry 
there can be no assurance that funds will be raised on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of our development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies  product candidates or products that we would not otherwise relinquish 
if we are successful in raising additional funds  we may issue additional equity securities that may dilute our earnings and net tangible book value per share 
dependence on new and unproven radiation technology 
the rdx catheter is designed to reduce the frequency of restenosis following the interventional treatment of atherosclerosis by locally applying beta radiation to the diseased blood vessel 
this and other radiation technologies and products that we intend to develop are in the early stages of development and require significant research  development and testing 
our development of these products is subject to the risks of failure commonly experienced in the development of new products based on innovative or novel technologies 
while early clinical results by our competitors indicate that radiation will reduce local restenosis  the limited clinical trials of the technology show positive and lasting clinical results 
the possibility also exists that any or all of these proposed technologies and products will be found to be ineffective or unsafe  will fail to meet applicable regulatory standards or will fail to obtain required regulatory approvals 
in addition  even if radiation technology and products are developed successfully and are effective  they may be uneconomical to market  or other companies may hold the proprietary rights which could preclude us from marketing such technologies and products 
due to the relatively short half life ie  shelf life of the company s current rdx catheter design  unlike its existing products  it is critical to ship the products as close to the date of use as possible 
moreover  coordination between the company  a contract manufacturer  the distributor and the end user is necessary in order to reduce waste and returned products 
to help reduce the shipping time for the product and improve the company s response time  the company has contracted with a third party manufacturer  bebig  in europe to perform the final assembly and radioactive source manufacturing of the devices for international use and anticipates the use of a similar facility in the united states 
if the company fails to establish the aforementioned shipping capability or adequate manufacturing sources  it could have a material adverse effect on radiance s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to achieve profitable operations  we must develop and obtain regulatory approval for products based on radiation technology  and introduce and market these products successfully 
significant preclinical and clinical development work for the products based on the radiance technologies remains to be completed 
we have not generated  nor can we be certain that we will generate in the near future  any operating revenues based on new products 
we cannot assure you that we will develop  obtain regulatory approval for or introduce and market these products successfully  and any failure on our part could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
dependence upon new products and technology  rapid technological change  risk of obsolescence 
we are in the rapidly changing  competitive and heavily regulated medical device industry  which makes it difficult for us to predict our risks and expenses with any amount of certainty 
we cannot say with any certainty that our research and development activities will enable us to produce any products able to withstand competition 
our development of each product is subject to the risks of failure commonly experienced in the development of products based upon innovative technologies and the expense and difficulty of obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies 
all of our potential products currently under development will require significant additional funding and development and pre clinical and clinical testing before we are able to submit them to any of the regulatory agencies for approval for commercial use 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to license any technologies or proposed products or to complete successfully any of our research and development activities 
even if we do complete them  there is no assurance that we will be able to market successfully any of the products  or that we will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approval  or that customers will like our products 
we also face the risk that any or all of our products will not work as intended or that they will be toxic  or that  even if they do work and are safe  that our products will be difficult to manufacture or market on a large scale 
we also face the risk that the proprietary rights of other persons or entities will prevent us from marketing any of our products or that other persons or entities might market their products as well as we market our products or even better 
even if we overcome all of the above obstacles successfully  our products are subject to rapid technological change and obsolescence 
in addition  our competitors may introduce new products or new technology that could render our products obsolete or unmarketable 
we therefore may be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain any technological and competitive position in our industry 
significant preclinical and clinical development work for the products based on the radiance technologies remains to be completed 
we have not generated  nor do we expect to generate in the near future  any operating revenues based on our new radiation products 
we cannot assure you that we will develop  obtain regulatory approval for or introduce and market these products successfully  and any failure on our part could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
limited sales of products to date  uncertainty of market acceptance 
our catheters and stents are used in conjunction with angioplasty and other intravascular procedures such as vascular stenting and solution delivery 
although we have received regulatory clearance for a total of product models  only certain of these product models have been marketed  and then only in limited quantities  or in certain markets  or in certain countries 
although interventional catheters are used widely by physicians  because our catheter designs are relatively new  our product s commercial success will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community as useful  cost effective components of interventional vascular procedures and localized solution delivery 
continued good relations with certain prominent doctors and researchers in the medical community are essential for us to promote the uses and acceptance of our approved products 
no products utilizing the radiance radiotherapy technology are currently commercially available 
we cannot predict the clinical acceptance by physicians of the radiance technology integrating beta radiation with traditional minimally invasive techniques as compared to more conventional treatment modalities 
we also cannot predict how a short shelf life for the products will affect clinical acceptance by physicians 
other companies may have superior resources to market similar products or technologies or have superior technologies and products to market 
significant competition 
we believe the primary competitive factors in the market for interventional cardiology devices are clinical effectiveness  product safety  catheter size  flexibility and trackability  ease of use  reliability  price and availability of third party reimbursement 
in addition  a company s distribution capability and the time in which products can be developed and receive regulatory approval are important competitive factors 
although we believe we compete favorably with respect to the foregoing factors  we also believe that our competitive position depends upon our ability to continue to develop innovative new catheter technologies  such as the rdx catheter  to obtain rapid regulatory approval and to manufacture and distribute such products efficiently 
competition in the market for devices used in the treatment of cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease is intense  and is expected to increase 
there is rapid technological innovation and change in the interventional cardiology device market and our products could be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations 
the catheters  stents and other products we are developing or have developed compete or will compete with catheters and stents marketed by a number of manufacturers  including guidant corporation  boston scientific corporation  johnson johnson  and medtronic  inc 
such companies have significantly greater financial  management and other resources  established market positions  and significantly larger sales and marketing organizations than we do 
we also face competition from manufacturers of other catheter based atherectomy devices  vascular stents and pharmaceutical products intended to treat vascular disease 
in addition  we believe that many of the purchasers and potential purchasers of our competitors products prefer to purchase catheter and stent products from a single source 
accordingly  many of our competitors  because of their size and range of product offerings  have a competitive advantage over radiance 
it is also possible that our competitors may succeed in developing products that are safer or more effective than those that we are developing and may obtain fda approvals for their products faster than we can 
several companies are developing devices to improve the outcome of coronary revascularization procedures  such as ptca  including several companies that have various radiation therapy products under investigation to reduce the frequency of restenosis 
the radiation therapy devices being developed by our competitors include intravessel radiation delivered through a variety of means and a variety of radiation sources  including gamma  beta and x ray 
we are not certain that our research and development activities into the radiance technology will enable us to produce any products able to withstand competition 
there are more than ten competing development programs in the area of vascular radiotherapy and our major competitors include the novoste corporation  johnson johnson  guidant corporation and boston scientific corporation 
each of these competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources compared to us and there is no assurance that we can develop the products able to compete with these larger competitors 
reliance on patents and proprietary technology  risk of patent infringement 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to get patent protection for our products and processes in the united states and elsewhere 
we have filed and intend to continue to file patent applications as we need them 
we cannot say with any certainty  however  that any additional patents will issue from any of these applications or  if patents do issue  that the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or that the issued patents will provide competitive advantages for our products 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient protection of our proprietary rights in our products or processes prior to or after obtaining regulatory clearances  our competitors may be able to obtain regulatory clearance and market competing products by demonstrating the equivalency of their products to our products 
if they are successful at demonstrating the equivalency between the products  our competitors would not have to conduct the same lengthy clinical tests that we have conducted 
the interventional cardiovascular and peripheral vascular device market  and more specifically  the market for balloon angioplasty catheters and coronary stents including those products we offer has been subject to substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that our products do not infringe on such patents or rights  and we cannot say with any certainty that any patents issued to us or licensed by us can withstand challenges made by others or that we will be able to protect our rights 
we are aware of patent applications and issued patents belonging to our competitors  and we are uncertain whether any of these  or any patent applications which we do not know about  will require us to alter or cease our potential products or processes 
we cannot say with any certainty that we will be able to obtain any licenses to technology that we will require or  if obtainable  that the cost will be reasonable 
our failure to obtain any necessary licenses to any technology could hurt our business substantially if we could not redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement 
expensive and drawn out litigation also may be necessary for us to assert any of our rights or to determine the scope and validity of rights claimed by other parties 
with no certainty as to the outcome  litigation could be too expensive for us to pursue 
our failure to pursue litigation could result in the loss of our rights that could hurt our business substantially 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent that the laws of the united states  if at all 
we also own trade secrets and confidential information that we try to protect by entering into confidentiality agreements with other parties 
we cannot be certain that any of the confidentiality agreements will be honored  or  if breached  that we would have enough remedies to protect our confidential information 
further  our competitors may independently learn our trade secrets or develop similar or superior technologies 
to the extent that our consultants  key employees or others apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our projects  disputes may arise regarding the proprietary rights to such information and there is no guarantee that such disputes will be resolved in our favor 
limited manufacturing experience and reliance on contract manufacturers 
the company s manufacturing experience is limited  we began manufacturing certain products at our facilities in july  introducing a number of new products in and as the technology is changing at a rapid pace  our expertise in manufacturing existing products does not provide assurance that we will be able to manufacture products based on new technology 
we must manufacture our products in compliance with a variety of licensing and other regulatory requirements  including the iso  the fda s qsr requirements  the us nuclear regulatory commission nrc requirements  and the requirements of the california department of health services cdhs in order to succeed 
in addition  building and operating production facilities that can handle the radiation sources required for the manufacture of the rdx catheter will require substantial additional funds and other resources 
we also need to manage the simultaneous manufacture of different products efficiently and to integrate the manufacture of new products with existing product lines 
during this process  we may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel 
in addition  we purchase many standard and custom built components from independent suppliers and we subcontract certain manufacturing processes to independent vendors 
most of these components and processes are available from more than one vendor  however  we may not be able to enter into any arrangements with outside manufacturers on terms favorable to us  if at all 
moreover  certain manufacturing processes  such as final assembly and radioactive source manufacturing of our rdx catheters  are currently performed by single vendors 
an interruption of performance by any of these vendors could cripple our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply was qualified 
no assurance of fda approval  government regulation 
the fda and other similar agencies in foreign countries have substantial requirements for therapeutic and diagnostic pharmaceutical and biological products 
such requirements involve lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
it often takes companies several years to satisfy these requirements  depending on the complexity and novelty of the product 
the review process also is extensive  which may delay the approval process even more 
these regulatory requirements could substantially hurt our ability to clinically test and manufacture our potential products 
government regulation also could delay our marketing of new products for a considerable period of time  impose costly procedures upon our activities and give our competitors an advantage 
moreover  the fda and other regulatory agencies may not grant us approval for any of our products on a timely basis  if at all 
any delay in obtaining  or failure to obtain  such approvals could substantially hurt our marketing of any proposed products and our ability to earn product revenue 
further  regulation is subject to change and any additional regulation could limit or restrict our ability to use any of our technologies  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
because the rdx catheter uses radiation sources  its manufacture  distribution  transportation  import export  use and disposal is subject to federal  state and or local laws and regulations relating to the use and handling of radioactive materials 
we must obtain a license from the nrc to commercially distribute such radiation sources and comply with all applicable regulations  as does our supplier of radiation sources 
we and our suppliers of radiation sources must comply with nrc and us department of transportation regulations on the labeling and packaging requirements for shipment of radiation sources to hospitals or to the other users of the rdx catheter 
in addition  hospitals may be required to obtain or expand their licenses to use and handle beta radiation prior to receiving radiation sources used in the rdx catheter 
comparable radiation regulatory requirements and or approvals are anticipated in markets outside the us finally  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future 
in the future  we could also be subject to other federal  state or local regulations that could affect our research and development programs 
we are unable to predict whether any agency will adopt any rule that could substantially hurt our business and our results of operations 
uncertainty related to health care reimbursement and reform measures 
health care providers  such as hospitals and physicians that purchase or lease medical devices in the united states  generally rely on third party payors  principally medicare  medicaid and private health insurance plans  including health maintenance organizations  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the treatment for which the medical device is being used 
third party payors increasingly have challenged the cost of medical products and services  which have and could continue to have a significant effect on the ratification of such products and services by many health care providers 
several proposals have been made by federal and state government officials that may lead to health care reforms  including a government directed national healthcare system and health care cost containment measures 
the effect of changes in the healthcare system or method of reimbursement for any medical device that we may market in the united states cannot be determined 
moreover  our success in developing products based on novel or innovative technology  such as the rdx catheter  may depend  in part  on whether our customers will be reimbursed by government health administrative authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
there is significant uncertainty if costs associated with newly approved health care products will be reimbursed 
there is no assurance that sufficient reimbursement will be available for us to establish and maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on developing our new products 
government and other third party payors are attempting to contain health care costs more every day by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new therapeutic and diagnostic products approved for marketing by the fda and by refusing  in some cases  to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for disease indications for which the fda has not granted market approval 
if adequate coverage and reimbursement levels are not provided by government and third party payors for use of our new products  it will be very difficult for us to market our products to doctors and hospitals and will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
lastly  we cannot predict what additional legislation or regulations  if any  may be enacted or adopted in the future relating to our business or the healthcare industry  including third party coverage and reimbursement  or what effect any such legislation or regulations may have on us 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
we have experienced operating losses for each of the last six years 
considering the anticipated operating losses of radiance  we expect to continue to incur consolidated operating losses through at least  and there can be no assurance that we will ever be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
our results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter 
quarterly operating results will depend upon several factors  including timing and amount of expenses associated with expanding our operations  the conduct of clinical trials and the timing of regulatory approvals  new product introductions both in the united states and internationally  the mix between pilot production of new products and full scale manufacturing of existing products  the mix between domestic and export sales  variations in foreign exchange rates  changes in third party payor s reimbursement policies and healthcare reform 
we do not operate with a significant backlog of customer orders  and therefore revenues in any one quarter are mainly dependent on orders received within that quarter 
in addition  we cannot predict ordering rates by distributors  some of whom place infrequent stocking orders 
our expenses are relatively fixed and difficult to adjust in response to fluctuating revenues 
as a result of these and other factors  we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
limited marketing and sales resources  dependence upon strategic partners 
we depend on medical device distributors and certain strategic relationships  some of which are with our competitors  to distribute our products 
recently  there has been significant consolidation among medical device suppliers as the major suppliers have attempted to broaden their product lines in order to respond to cost pressures from healthcare providers 
this consolidation has made it increasingly difficult for smaller suppliers  like us  to distribute products effectively without a relationship with one or more of the major suppliers 
through a licensing agreement  guidant corporation currently markets certain products based on our patented focus technology in the us and certain foreign markets 
revenue generated from these distributor relationships will directly depend upon their efforts to market our products 
product liability and insurance 
clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to product liability claims 
although we never have been subject to a product liability claim  we cannot assure you that there will not be any claims brought against us in the future 
even then  the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate and one or more successful claims brought against us may have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  adverse product liability actions could negatively affect the reputation and sales of our products and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products 
dependence upon international sales 
we derive significant revenue from international sales  and therefore a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be subject to the risks associated with international sales 
these risks include economic or political instability  shipping delays  changes in applicable regulatory policies  inadequate protection of intellectual property  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and various trade restrictions  all of which could have a significant impact on our ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis 
in foreign countries  our products are subject to governmental review and certification 
the regulation of medical devices in foreign countries  particularly in the european union  continues to expand and we cannot be certain that new laws or regulations will not have an adverse effect on our business 
limited public market  volatility of stock price 
our common stock has been traded on the nasdaq national market since june and the price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly 
we are in the medical device industry and the market price of securities of small life sciences companies in general has been very unpredictable 
announcements by us or our competitors concerning technological innovations  new products  proposed governmental regulations or actions  developments or disputes relating to patents or proprietary rights  public concern over the safety of therapeutic products and other factors that affect the market generally could significantly impact our business and the market price of our securities 
effect of certain charter provisions 
certain provisions of our amended restated certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our business  even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our amended restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
any such issuance could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our business and may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders 
in addition  our board of directors is divided into three classes for staggered terms of three years 
although this measure is designed to protect stockholder interests in the event of a hostile takeover attempt against the company  this provision can have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of the company  adversely effecting the market price of our common stock 
dividends 
since our formation in  we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock  nor do we anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the future
