item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview  certain factors that make future results difficult to predict  certain items to remember when reading our financial statements our quarterly operating results vary significantly depending on the timing of new product introductions and enhancements by ourselves and by our competitors 
our results also depend on the volume and timing of orders which are difficult to forecast 
because our customers generally order on an as needed basis  and we normally ship products within one week after receipt of an order  we don t have an order backlog which can assist us in forecasting results 
for all these reasons  our results of operations for any quarter are a poor indicator of the results to be expected in any future quarter 
a large portion of our quarterly revenue is usually generated in the last few weeks of the quarter 
since our ongoing operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we plan our expenditures based primarily on sales forecasts  if revenue generated in the last few weeks of a quarter do not meet our forecast  operating results can be very negatively affected 
we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
such capitalized costs are amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated economic life of the product  which is generally three years

results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from sonic solutions statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal years through years ended march  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses marketing and sales research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss other expense provision benefit for income taxes net loss comparison of fiscal years ended march net revenue 
our net revenue increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and decreased to  in fiscal  representing an increase of from fiscal to fiscal and a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales of dvd creator systems 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in sales of our audio products which was partially offset by increases in sales of our dvd systems  including our two newer products  dvdit and dvd fusion 
international sales accounted for  and of our net revenue for the   and fiscal years  respectively 
see note of notes to financial statements 
our international sales decreased in fiscal due to the increased sales of dvd creator systems in the us markets 
our international sales remained consistent in fiscal primarily due to the continuation of more sales of dvd creator systems in the us markets 
international sales have historically represented around of our total sales  and we expect that they will continue to represent a significant percentage of future revenue 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue decreased from of net revenue in fiscal to in fiscal and decreased to in fiscal the decrease in cost of revenue in fiscal year and fiscal year is primarily due to a shift in sales product mix towards higher margin dvd creator system and dvdit sales 
in general we have been selling less hardware as a percentage of revenue in our professional systems and our new product dvdit includes no hardware 
marketing and sales 
our marketing and sales expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and increased to  in fiscal marketing and sales represented  and of net revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
our marketing and sales expenses remained relatively consistent in dollar terms from fiscal to fiscal our marketing and sales expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to increases in salary expenses as a result of the increase in headcount  and increases in advertising and marketing costs related to our dvdit and our dvd product lines 
our marketing and sales headcount increased from thirty seven at march  to forty at march  included in our marketing and sales expenses are dealer and employee commission expenses  which as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in fiscal to in both fiscal and fiscal research and development 
our research and development expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and increased to  in fiscal our research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
this means that a portion of the costs we incur for software development are not recorded as an expense in the period in which they are actually incurred 
instead they are recorded as an asset on our balance sheet 
the amount recorded on our balance sheet is then amortized over the estimated life of the products in which the software is included 
our research and development expenses decreased in fiscal due to decreases in consulting and prototype expenses associated with new product introductions 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to increased headcount from thirty at march  to thirty two at march  and due to consulting expenses associated with introductions of new products  including our dvdit product 
prototype and consulting expenses can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending upon the status of hardware and software development projects and our schedule of new product introductions 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and increased to  in fiscal these expenses represented of net revenue in fiscal  of net revenue in fiscal and of net revenue in fiscal our general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal due to reductions in bad debt and other general expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to a charge to bad debt expense of  which represented an additional reserve for sales to audio professionals and distributors who are experiencing liquidity difficulties due to a decline in their business 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses exclusive of the bad debt expense will increase in the future as costs increase and if our operations expand 
other expense  net 
the other expense item on our statement of operations includes primarily the net amount of interest or other financing charges we have incurred due to borrowings  reduced by the interest we earn on cash balances and short term investments 
for our  and fiscal years  we incurred interest and other financing charges related to financing agreements we had with entities associated with hambrecht quist  as well as borrowings under our bank credit line 
provision for income taxes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we made no provision for income taxes for our  fiscal years

during the fiscal year we exhausted our ability to carryback tax losses resulting from operations in the fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources 
in december  we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
this agreement  which we sometimes refer to as our bank credit line  has been modified or renewed at various times since december the current bank credit line renewed in september  provides for up to  in available borrowings based upon our eligible accounts receivable balances 
the current bank credit line will expire on september  this bank credit line provides for a variety of covenants  including among other things  that we maintain certain financial ratios 
the bank credit line is collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets 
interest on borrowings under this agreement is payable monthly at a rate of one and one quarter percent in excess of the prime rate 
on march  there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement 
in december   we also obtained a  financing facility with entities associated with hambrecht quist 
this facility included subordinated debt as well as equipment lease financing 
we received  of subordinated debt from hambrecht quist transition capital  llc and  of subordinated debt from hambrecht quist guaranty finance  llc  pursuant to the above facility 
the remaining  of the facility was used to fund a master lease line for financing of future capital asset purchases 
the facility with the hambrecht quist entities is secured by an interest in our fixed assets and substantially all of our other assets but is subordinate to our bank credit line 
in connection with this financing facility  we issued warrants to purchases  common shares to entities associated with hambrecht quist 
the hambrecht quist entities were entitled to exercise the warrants with respect to  shares at an exercise price of at any time on or before december   and with respect to  shares at an exercise price of at any time on or after december  and before december  in december  all of the warrants were exercised on a net basis  and the warrant holder received  shares of common stock 
we recorded  of deferred interest attributable to the value of the warrants  which was amortized using the effective interest rate method to interest expense over the term of the financing facility 
the fair value of the warrants was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions volatility of  risk free interest rate of and expected life equal to the contractual terms 
in march   we renegotiated our financing arrangement with hambrecht quist guaranty finance 
the agreement we reached involved the restructuring of  debt into  of series c convertible preferred stock see note of notes to financial statements and  of debt 
the interest rate on such restructured debt was and was due in october we filed a form s registration statement under the securities act of to register the resale of the  shares of the company s common stock which underlie the series c convertible preferred stock issued to hambrecht quist guaranty finance 
in connection with the agreement  the exercise price of  of the warrants issued with the original arrangement reached in december was lowered to the fair value of common stock of 
we accounted for this transaction by revaluing the new warrants  using comparable assumptions as the original warrant grant  and the resultant value of  was amortized over the new loan period 
in june    of the warrants were exercised on a net exercise basis  and the warrant holder received  shares of common stock 
during the fiscal years ended march  and march    and  shares of the preferred stock were converted into common stock pursuant to this financing arrangement

the interest rate on the restructured debt is and the debt and interest are payable in monthly installments through april  in connection with this agreement  we issued warrants to purchase  common shares at an exercise price of 
these warrants expire on april  we also enhanced the conversion rate of hambrecht and quist s existing series c convertible preferred stock so that each share of series c convertible preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock 
the beneficial conversion feature  warrants and new debt were recorded at their relative fair values 
we recorded  of deferred financing costs attributable to this finance restructuring with hambrecht quist guaranty 
this amount is being amortized using the effective interest rate method to interest expense over the term of the financing facility months 
the fair value of the warrants was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions volatility of  risk free interest rate of and expected life equal to the contractual terms 
we filed a form s registration statement under the securities act of to register the shares of the common stock which underlie the series c convertible preferred stock and the  shares of our common stock which underlie the warrants issued to hambrecht quist guaranty finance

the availability of the credit line  and the amounts and timing of draws under the line were subject to a number of conditions 
in january   we filed a form s registration statement under the securities act of to register the resale of shares issued under this credit line 
during the fiscal year ended march   we drew  from this credit line for which we issued  shares of common stock 
during the fiscal year ended march   we drew an additional  from this credit line for which we issued  shares of common stock 
this facility is no longer available to us

under this arrangement  we were able to draw up to  in cash in exchange for common stock 
pricing of the common stock issued under this arrangement was based on the market price of our common stock at the time of a draw  discounted by or  depending upon the price of our common stock 
the availability of the credit line  and the amounts and timing of draws under the line were subject to a number of conditions 
on may   we filed a registration statement on form s to register for resale the shares we may issue to kingsbridge under this credit line and on august  the statement became effective 
during the fiscal year ended march   we drew  from the credit line for which we issued  shares of common stock 
because of limitations on the total number of shares that could be issued under this line of credit  this facility is no longer available to us and was terminated on march  on may   we secured a new equity based line of credit by entering into a new stock purchase agreement with kingsbridge

our operating activities have used cash of  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year during those fiscal years cash required by operating activities was not as great as our operating losses due to various factors  including improvements in receivables collection and inventory turnover  and the receipt of income tax refunds in certain fiscal years 
in addition to our operating losses  we utilized cash during the   and fiscal years to purchase new fixed assets  pay down debt obligations and to develop and purchase software that was added to capitalized software 
during fiscal we augmented cash on hand via borrowings from our bank credit line described above  as well as draws on the equity credit line described above 
during the and fiscal years we augmented cash on hand primarily by drawing on the equity credit lines described above 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  available credit and cash generated from operations  plus cash available through the new equity based line of credit with kingsbridge when and if it becomes available see discussion above will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal year as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  impact of year issue 
we have not experienced any major system failures or disruptions as a result of the year issue 
in addition  we did not incur significant incremental costs to become year compliant
