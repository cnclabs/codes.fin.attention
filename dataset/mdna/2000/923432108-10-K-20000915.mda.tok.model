overview verilink corporation the company develops  manufactures  and markets integrated access products and customer premises equipment cpe for use by telecommunication network service providers and corporate end users 
the company s products enable network service providers to connect their enterprise customers over broadband access services such as t  dsl  and fiber 
the company s customers include equipment integrators  service providers including wireline and wireless carriers  competitive local exchange carriers clecs  internet service providers isps  and large enterprise customers including local  state  and federal government agencies 
in fiscal  the company consolidated its operations into its existing operations located in huntsville  alabama in order to reduce expenses and enable the company to achieve profitability at lower revenue levels 
the san jose facilities were closed and the company outsourced its san jose based manufacturing operations to a third party electronics manufacturing services provider 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company acquired txport  a manufacturer of high speed voice  and data communications products  based in huntsville  alabama for  in cash  which was funded by the company s working capital 
accordingly  the results of operations of txport have been included in the company s results of operations commencing november   the date of acquisition 
during  verilink s as product line continued to generate the majority of sales 
verilink designed the as with modular hardware and software to enable its customers to access increased network capacity and to adopt new communications services in a cost effective manner 
the as provides integrated access to low speed services  fractional t e services  and t  e  t  and frame relay services 
the wansuite tm product family is a suite of software programmable intelligent integrated access devices iads that target customer premise applications for improving last mile broadband communications 
the wansuite tm product family is powered by industry standard microprocessors that increase processing power over traditional termination devices by a factor of times 
the company also sells single purpose network access devices for selected applications 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the company s results of operations may fluctuate from period to period in the future 
results of operations sales thousands net sales    percentage change from preceding year net sales for fiscal increased to million from net sales of million in the sales contribution of products acquired from txport for a full twelve months in fiscal compared to months in accounted for all this increase offset by lower sales to worldcom in fiscal net sales for increased from net sales of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the sales contribution of products acquired from the txport acquisition 
sales from the txport products represented approximately and of sales in fiscal and  respectively 
net sales for were million representing a decrease of from sales of million 
during fiscal  shipments of the as product line accounted for approximately of net sales compared to during and in the sales contribution of the wansuite tm family of integrated access devices was negligible in fiscal because customer testing cycles extended beyond what had been anticipated 
the company s business is characterized by a concentration of sales to a limited number of key customers 
sales to the company s top five customers accounted for   and of sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
the company s largest customers in fiscal were nortel  worldcom  bell atlantic nynex  ameritech  and ericsson formerly qualcomm 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and factors affecting future results customer concentration 
the company sells its products primarily in the united states through a direct sales force and through a variety of resellers  including original equipment manufacturers oems  system integrators  value added resellers vars  and distributors 
sales to vars and distributors accounted for approximately of sales in fiscal  as compared to approximately in and in to date  sales outside of north america have not been significant 
however  the company intends to expand the marketing of its products to markets outside of north america 
gross profit thousands gross profit    percentage of sales gross profit  as a percentage of sales  in fiscal was as compared to in and in the increase in gross profit margin in fiscal was a result of a number of factors  but was primarily attributable to the benefits of the restructuring and consolidation plan completed during the year 
fiscal gross margins were impacted negatively by under utilization of the san jose facility before the restructuring  a high level of non warranty repairs during the first quarter of the fiscal year that carried a lower than average gross margin  and the additional warranty costs associated with the agreement the company reached with a customer to share in the expense associated with correcting a problem involving one of the company s products installed in the field 
the decrease in gross profit margin in was primarily due to significantly lower sales volume for the company s then san jose based operations  particularly in the second half of the year  in combination with the relatively fixed cost of maintaining manufacturing operations in both california and alabama 
this lower sales volume was accompanied by a reduction in unit volumes of normally high unit volume products  and resulted in inefficiencies associated with producing a high mix of products at lower volumes 
in future periods  the company s gross profit will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the cost of products manufactured at subcontract facilities  the channels of distribution  the price of products sold  discounting practices  the mix of products sold  price competition  increases in material costs  and changes in other components of cost of sales 
as the company introduces new products  it is possible that such products may have lower gross profit than other established products in high volume production 
accordingly  gross profit as a percentage of sales may vary 
research and development thousands research and development    percentage of sales research and development r d expenses decreased to million or of sales in fiscal compared to million or of sales in fiscal the expense decrease during fiscal was due primarily to the restructuring and consolidation plan  and refocusing r d resources to key product development activities such as wansuite tm 
the decrease in r d expenses in fiscal as a percentage of sales was due to the lower spending at higher sales volumes 
the r d increase to million or of sales in from million or of sales in was due principally to the addition of expenses associated with the txport development organization beginning in november  and to an increased rate of development on the as product line during the first half of the fiscal year 
although r d expenses increased in absolute dollars  it decreased as a percentage of sales due to higher sales volume in as compared to the company considers product development expenditures to be critical to future sales and expects to significantly increase research and development expenditures in  while such expenditures as a percentage of sales may vary 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will result in commercially successful new technology and products in the future  and those efforts may be affected by other factors as noted below 
see factors affecting future results dependence on recently introduced products and products under development 
selling  general and administrative thousands selling  general and administrative 
   percentage of sales the company s selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to million  or of sales in fiscal from million  or of sales in fiscal several factors impact the comparability of these two fiscal years such as i completion of the restructuring and consolidation plan in december with the closing of the facilities in san jose and corresponding staff reductions  ii inclusion of the expenses associated with the txport acquisition for months in fiscal compared to months in fiscal  and iii depreciation and amortization from the erp implementation for months in fiscal compared to months in fiscal following the april conversation date 
selling expenses increased  but at a lower rate than the sales increase 
marketing expenses remained flat in fiscal  but included the cost from the use of an outside consultant to assist in establishing a new strategic direction for the company 
general and administrative expenses decreased with the reduction in the number of administrative support personnel and the completion of the erp implementation 
the decrease in sg a spending as a percentage of sales is due to the slight decrease in dollar spending at higher sales levels 
the increase in sg a dollars spent in fiscal compared to was primarily the result of the addition of expenses from the txport acquisition 
selling expenses increased as a result of increased selling efforts and equipment demonstration costs 
marketing expenses increased principally as a result of incremental costs associated with the integration of sales collateral of txport into a single company  more extensive trade show participation  and increases in other promotional activities such as direct mail campaigns 
general and administrative expenses also increased as a result of increases in staff associated with the acquisition of txport and outside contract costs associated with the implementation of the company s erp system 
these expenses increased as a percentage of sales to in from in due to increased dollar spending between periods 
the company expects that general and administrative expenses will remain flat to slightly increasing  but decrease as a percentage of sales 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to increase sales and reduce sg a as a percentage of sales 
see factors affecting future results restructuring actions may not achieve intended results 
restructuring charges in july  the company announced its plans to substantially consolidate its san jose operations into its existing operations located in huntsville  alabama 
the goal of this plan was to reduce expenses and enable the company to achieve profitability at lower revenue levels 
by the end of december  the company had completed this consolidation of its operations 
the company incurred a net restructuring charge during fiscal of  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of this restructuring charge 
approximately  of the restructuring charge was cash in nature and paid out of the company s working capital 
in march  the company announced and implemented a restructuring of the business to streamline operations and eliminate redundant functions by consolidating manufacturing operations  combining sales and marketing functions  and restructuring research and development activities 
included as a part of the restructuring activities was the retirement of the company s two founders 
the company incurred a restructuring charge of  in fiscal and a credit of  was recorded in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of the restructuring charge 
approximately  of the restructuring charge was cash in nature and paid out of the company s working capital 
acquired in process research and development effective november   the company completed its acquisition of txport  inc txport from acme cleveland corporation  by purchasing all the outstanding shares of txport at a cost of  txport is a manufacturer of high speed voice and data communications products 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method  and the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including core technology  and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair market values at the date of acquisition 
at the time of the acquisition  the company was involved in research and development projects in relation to three areas  enhancement and augmentation of the csu product line  enhancement and augmentation of the csu dsu product line and development of packet and frame aware csu dsu products along with a virtual private network product 
the in process research and development of million  which was expensed at the acquisition date  represented the estimated current fair market value of the research and development projects which had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses at the date of acquisition 
the value of in process research and development was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion 
the net cash flows from the identified projects were based on management estimates of revenues  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and income taxes from the project 
the research and development costs included in the model reflect costs to sustain the project  but exclude costs to bring the in process project to technological feasibility 
the estimated revenues were based on management projections for the projects 
projected gross margins reflect recent historical performance of other company products and are in line with industry expectations 
the estimated selling  general and administrative costs  and research and development costs were estimated excluding synergies expected from the acquisition 
the discount rate used in discounting the net cash flows from in process research and development is 
this discount rate reflects the uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in process research and development  market acceptance of the technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology and the uncertainty of technological advances that could potentially impact the estimates described above 
the percent of completion for the three project areas was determined by comparing both effort expected and research and development costs incurred as of november  to the remaining effort to be expended and research and development costs to be incurred  based on management s estimates  to bring the projects to technological feasibility 
based on these comparisons  management estimated the three project areas to be approximately   and complete as of the date of acquisition 
the projects were substantially completed by june the effort and costs required to complete the projects approximated the estimates made by management at the date of acquisition 
the results of the operations acquired have been included with those of the company from the date of acquisition 
intangible assets have been recorded and are being amortized over estimated useful lives between three and ten years 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net declined to million in fiscal from million and million in and  respectively  as a result of lower invested cash and short term investment balances 
benefit from income taxes during fiscal  the company recorded a benefit from income taxes of  that included the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance established in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal without the impact of the change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was about  compared to a combined federal and state statutory rate of about 
the effective tax rate in fiscal without the impact of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is less than the combined federal and state rates primarily due to the non deductibility of the amortization of goodwill associated with the txport acquisition 
in fiscal  the company recorded no benefit from income taxes due to continued operating losses and the uncertainty of realization of the company s net deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  the company recorded a benefit from income taxes of  representing an effective tax rate of 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company s principal sources of liquidity included million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
during fiscal  the company used million of net cash in operating activities  a  increase from the million of net cash used in operating activities in fiscal during fiscal the company generated million in net cash from operating activities 
accounts receivable increased million to million at june  from million at june  due to less linearity in shipments in the fourth quarter and a slow down in payments from our largest customers 
accounts receivable increased million to million at june  over the prior year balance 
this was due to the acquisition of txport  less linearity in shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal than in  and a million advance billing made to a customer at its request 
inventories decreased million to million at june  primarily due to raw materials and work in process inventories transferred to the third party electronics manufacturing services provider in october as part of the restructuring and consolidation plan 
inventories increased million to million at june  from million at june  this increase was due to the acquisition of txport and lower sales volume in the fourth quarter of than expected 
during  accrued expenses decreased million to million due to lower salary and benefit accruals associated with reduced headcount from the consolidation of operations  payments charged against the warranty reserve for the agreement reached with a customer to share in the cost of field upgrades  and one time adjustments to estimated accruals to customers and vendors 
in  total current liabilities increased million to million due mainly to the liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of txport 
net cash provided by investing activities of  in fiscal compares to net cash used in investing activities of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in funds provided by investing activities in fiscal is primarily a result of the maturity of million in short term investments offset by million in purchases of property  plant and equipment  including the new facility the company acquired on june  for million 
the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from the maturity of in short term investments offset by million in cash used for the acquisition of txport  million of capital equipment and million of notes receivable from a director 
the net cash used in investing activities in was primarily the result of greater purchases of short term investments and purchases of property and equipment 
the company estimates that total budgeted capital expenditures in fiscal will approximate million and will include expenditures to remodel and upgrade the facility acquired on june  and for r d and manufacturing tools and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash used in financing activities of  in fiscal and net cash provided by financing activities of  in proceeds of million from long term debt used to finance the acquisition of the facility purchased on june  was the largest source of cash from financing activities during fiscal along with proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
the use of cash in was primarily attributable to the company s repurchase of  of its common stock offset by  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
in february  the board of directors authorized the company s management to systematically repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock 
the company purchased  shares and  shares in fiscal and at a cost of  and  respectively  under this program 
the company intends to cancel this repurchase program 
the company believes that its cash and investment balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance current operations  anticipated investments  and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  the company continues to investigate the possibility of generating financial resources through committed credit agreements  technology  or manufacturing partnerships  equipment financing  and offerings of debt and equity securities 
year readiness the company s products  computing  and communications infrastructure systems have operated without year yk related problems to date 
the company is not aware that any of its major customers or third party suppliers has experienced significant yk related problems that would have a material impact on the company 
the total cost to address yk was not material to the company s financial condition 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb no 
which deferred the effective date provisions of sfas no 
for the company until fiscal year sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
however  since the company currently does not hold any derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activities  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
this pronouncement summarizes certain of the sec staff s views on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
the company has reviewed the requirements of sab and believes that its existing accounting policies are in accordance with the guidance provided in the sab

you should consult the risk factors listed from time to time in the company s reports on form q and the company s annual report to stockholders 
customer concentration 
a small number of customers continue to account for a majority of the company s sales 
in fiscal  net sales to nortel  worldcom  and ericsson accounted for   and of the company s net sales  and the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s net sales 
in fiscal  net sales to nortel  worldcom  and ericsson accounted for   and of the company s net sales  respectively  and net sales to the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s net sales 
in fiscal  net sales to nortel  worldcom  and ericsson accounted for   and of the company s net sales  respectively  and net sales to the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s net sales 
percentages of total revenue have been restated for prior periods as if the september merger of worldcom and mci and ericsson s may acquisition of qualcomm s terrestrial code division multiple access cdma wireless infrastructure business had been in effect for all periods presented 
other than nortel  worldcom  and ericsson  no customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales in fiscal years   or there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders with the company  that orders by existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods  or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
certain customers of the company have been or may be acquired by other existing customers 
the impact of such acquisitions on net sales to such customers is uncertain  but there can be no assurance that such acquisitions will not result in a reduction in net sales to those customers 
in addition  such acquisitions could have in the past and could in the future  result in further concentration of the company s customers 
the company has in the past experienced significant declines in net sales it believes were in part related to orders being delayed or cancelled as a result of pending acquisitions relating to its customers 
there can be no assurance that future merger and acquisition activity among the company s customers will not have a similar adverse affect on the company s net sales and results of operations 
the company s customers are typically not contractually obligated to purchase any quantity of products in any particular period 
product sales to major customers have varied widely from period to period 
in some cases  major customers have abruptly terminated purchases of the company s products 
loss of  or a material reduction in orders by  one or more of the company s major customers would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
see competition and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
dependence on outside contractors 
in september  the company entered into an agreement with a single outside contractor to outsource substantially all of the manufacturing operations previously located in san jose  including its procurement  assembly  and system integration operations 
the products manufactured by the outside contractor located in california generated a majority of the company s revenues 
there can be no assurance that this contractor will continue to meet the company s future requirements for manufactured products  or that the contractor will not experience quality problems in manufacturing the company s products 
the inability of the company s contractor to provide the company with adequate supplies of high quality products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the loss of any of the company s outside contractors could cause a delay in the company s ability to fulfill orders while the company identifies a replacement contractor 
because the establishment of new manufacturing relationships involves numerous uncertainties  including those relating to payment terms  cost of manufacturing  adequacy of manufacturing capacity  quality control and timeliness of delivery  the company is unable to predict whether such relationships would be on terms that the company regards as satisfactory 
any significant disruption in the company s relationships with its manufacturing sources would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future success will depend to a large extent on the continued contributions of its executive officers and key management  sales  and technical personnel 
the company is a party to agreements with certain of its executive officers to help ensure the officer s continual service to the company in the event of a change in control 
each of the company s executive officers  and key management  sales and technical personnel would be difficult to replace 
several members of the senior management team recently joined the company and have had only a limited time to work together 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers or key personnel  the inability of the management team to work effectively together  or the inability to continue to attract qualified personnel would delay product development cycles or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth 
to manage potential future growth effectively  the company must improve its operational  financial and management information systems and must hire  train  motivate and manage its employees 
the future success of the company also will depend on its ability to increase its customer support capability and to attract and retain qualified technical  marketing and management personnel  for whom competition is intense 
in particular  the current availability of qualified personnel may be limited and competition among companies for such personnel is intense 
the company is currently attempting to hire a number of product marketing and engineering personnel and has experienced some delays in filling such positions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively achieve or manage any such growth  and failure to do so could delay product development and introduction cycles or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see dependence on key personnel 
dependence on component availability and key suppliers 
the company generally relies upon a contract manufacturer to buy component parts that are incorporated into board assemblies used in its products 
on time delivery of the company s products depends upon the availability of components and subsystems used in its products 
currently  the company and third party sub contractors depend upon suppliers to manufacture  assemble and deliver components in a timely and satisfactory manner 
the company has historically obtained several components and licenses for certain embedded software from single or limited sources 
there can be no assurance that these suppliers will continue to be able and willing to meet the company and third party sub contractors requirements for any such components 
the company and third party sub contractors generally do not have any long term contracts with such suppliers  other than software vendors 
any significant interruption in the supply of  or degradation in the quality of  any such item could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
any loss in a key supplier  increase in required lead times  increase in prices of component parts  interruption in the supply of any of these components  or the inability of the company or its third party sub contractor to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
purchase orders from the company s customers frequently require delivery quickly after placement of the order 
as the company does not maintain significant component inventories  delay in shipment by a supplier could lead to lost sales 
the company uses internal forecasts to determine its general materials and components requirements 
lead times for materials and components may vary significantly  and depend on factors such as specific supplier performance  contract terms  and general market demand for components 
if orders vary from forecasts  the company may experience excess or inadequate inventory of certain materials and components  and suppliers may demand longer lead times  higher prices  or termination of contracts 
from time to time  the company has experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in fulfillment of customer orders 
such shortages and allocations may occur in the future  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
see fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s sales are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors resulting in more variability and less predictability in the company s quarter to quarter sales and operating results 
for example  sales to nortel  worldcom  and ericsson have varied between quarters by as much as million  and orders delayed by these customers had a significant negative impact on the company s third and fourth quarter results in fiscal most of the company s sales are in the form of large orders with short delivery times 
the company s ability to affect and judge the timing of individual customer orders is limited 
the company has experienced large fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter due to a wide variety of factors  such as delay  cancellation or acceleration of customer projects  and other factors discussed below 
the company s sales for a given quarter may depend to a significant degree upon planned product shipments to a single customer  often related to specific equipment deployment projects 
the company has experienced both acceleration and slowdown in orders related to such projects  causing changes in the sales level of a given quarter relative to both the preceding and subsequent quarters 
delays or lost sales can be caused by other factors beyond the company s control  including late deliveries by the third party subcontractors the company is using to outsource its manufacturing operations as well as by other vendors of components used in a customer s system  changes in implementation priorities  slower than anticipated growth in demand for the services that the company s products support and delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new services and products 
delays and lost sales have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
operating results in recent periods have been adversely affected by delays in receipt of significant purchase orders from customers 
the company believes that sales in prior periods have been adversely impacted by merger activities by some of its top customers 
in addition  the company has in the past experienced delays as a result of the need to modify its products to comply with unique customer specifications 
these and similar delays or lost sales could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see customer concentration and dependence on component availability and key suppliers 
the company s backlog at the beginning of each quarter typically is not sufficient to achieve expected sales for that quarter 
to achieve its sales objectives  the company is dependent upon obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter 
furthermore  the company s agreements with its customers typically provide that they may change delivery schedules and cancel orders within specified timeframes  typically up to days prior to the scheduled shipment date  without significant penalty 
the company s customers have in the past built  and may in the future build  significant inventory in order to facilitate more rapid deployment of anticipated major projects or for other reasons 
decisions by such customers to reduce their inventory levels could lead to reductions in purchases from the company 
these reductions  in turn  could cause fluctuations in the company s operating results and could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations in the periods in which the inventory is reduced 
the company s industry is characterized by declining prices of existing products  and therefore continual improvement of manufacturing efficiencies and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products are required to maintain gross margins 
in response to customer demands or competitive pressures  or to pursue new product or market opportunities  the company may take certain pricing or marketing actions  such as price reductions  volume discounts  or provision of services at below market rates 
these actions could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
operating results may also fluctuate due to a variety of factors  particularly delays in new product introductions by the company  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in the product or customer mix of sales  changes in the level of operating expenses  competitive pricing pressures  the gain or loss of significant customers  increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses associated with new product introductions  and general economic conditions 
all of the above factors are difficult for the company to forecast  and these or other factors can materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations regarding future sales and are fixed in the short term to a large extent 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in sales 
any significant decline in demand relative to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  the company has had  and in some future quarter may have operating results below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
see potential volatility of stock price 
the company s products are covered by warranties and the company is subject to contractual commitments concerning its products 
if unexpected circumstances arise such that the product does not perform as intended and the company is not successful in resolving product quality or performance issues  there could be an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
for example  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company was notified by one of its major customers of an intermittent problem involving one of the company s products installed in the field 
although the company identified a firmware fix for this problem and negotiated an agreement with the customer to share in the expense associated with the upgrade  this or similar problems in the future could increase expenses or reduce product acceptance 
potential volatility of stock price 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general conditions in the telecommunication network access and equipment industries  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many technology companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
company specific factors or broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the company has experienced significant fluctuations in its stock price and share trading volume in the past and may continue to do so 
dependence on recently introduced products and new product development 
the company s future results of operations are highly dependent on market acceptance of existing and future applications for both the company s as product line  and the wansuite tm family of integrated access devices introduced during the third quarter of fiscal the as product line represented approximately of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal  and of net sales in fiscal sales of wansuite tm products began during the last quarter of fiscal market acceptance of both the company s current and future product lines is dependent on a number of factors  not all of which are in the company s control  including the continued growth in the use of bandwidth intensive applications  continued deployment of new telecommunications services  market acceptance of integrated access devices in general  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  and the success of the company s sales efforts 
failure of the company s products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the market for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  continuing improvements in telecommunication service offerings  and changing demands of the company s customer base 
failure to introduce new products in a timely manner could cause companies to purchase products from competitors and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to a variety of factors  the company may experience delays in developing its planned products 
new products may require additional development work  enhancement  and testing or further refinement before the company can make them commercially available 
the company has in the past experienced delays in the introduction of new products  product applications and enhancements due to a variety of internal factors  such as reallocation of priorities  difficulty in hiring sufficient qualified personnel and unforeseen technical obstacles  as well as changes in customer requirements 
such delays have deferred the receipt of revenue from the products involved 
if the company s products have performance  reliability or quality shortcomings  then the company may experience reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable and additional warranty and service expenses 
competition 
the market for telecommunications network access equipment is highly competitive  and the company expects competition to increase in the future 
this market is subject to rapid technological change  regulatory developments  and new entrants 
the market for integrated access devices such as the access system product line and wansuite tm  and for enterprise devices such as the prism  framestart tm  and lite product lines is subject to rapid change 
the company believes that the primary competitive factors in this market are the development and rapid introduction of new product features  price and performance  support for multiple types of communications services  network management  reliability  and quality of customer support 
there can be no assurance that the company s current products and future products under development will be able to compete successfully with respect to these or other factors 
the company s principal competition to date for its current as and products has been from quick eagle networks formerly digital link corporation  adc kentrox  a division of adc telecommunications  and larscom  inc  a subsidiary of axel johnson 
in addition  the company experiences substantial competition with its enterprise access and network termination products from companies in the computer networking market and other related markets 
these competitors include premisys communications  inc now a part of zhone technologies  newbridge networks corporation  visual networks  adtran  inc  and paradyne inc 
to the extent that current or potential competitors can expand their current offerings to include products that have functionality similar to the company s products and planned products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company believes that the market for basic network termination products is mature  but that the market for feature enhanced network termination and network access products continues to grow and expand  as more capability and intelligence moves outward from the central office to the enterprise 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in this market are price  feature sets  installed base  and quality of customer support 
in this market  the company primarily competes with adtran  quick eagle networks  adc kentrox  paradyne  visual networks  and larscom 
there can be no assurance that such companies or other competitors will not introduce new products that provide greater functionality and or at a lower price than the company s like products 
in addition  advanced termination products are emerging which represent both new market opportunities as well as a threat to the company s current products 
furthermore  basic line termination functions are increasingly being integrated by competitors  such as cisco and nortel networks  into other equipment such as routers and switches 
these include direct wan interfaces in certain products  which may erode the addressable market for separate network termination products 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater technical  financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  many of the company s competitors have long established relationships with network service providers 
there can be no assurance that the company will have the financial resources  technical expertise  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully in the future

reorganization of sales force 
in july  the company restructured its sales force from a sales force organized by geographical region to one focused on sales to particular markets and through particular distribution channels 
this reorganization may be disruptive to our business and involves numerous uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the increased costs to retrain the sales force in the methods and techniques needed to effectively approach the different markets and distribution channels available for the company s products  the ability to retain current members of the sales force  the effectiveness of the sales force in closing sales  and the re allocation of relationships that the sales force may have previously developed with customers in the geographic regions 
as a result  the company expects that the reorganization may have a short term impact on the company s sales and results of operations 
the transition to a market and distribution channel based sales force may take longer or be less successful than anticipated  which  in either event  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
rapid technological change 
the network access and telecommunications equipment markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the rapid development of new technologies increases the risk that current or new competitors could develop products that would reduce the competitiveness of the company s products 
the company s success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to respond to changes in technology and customer requirements 
this will require the timely selection  development and marketing of new products and enhancements on a cost effective basis 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring high levels of innovation 
the company may need to supplement its internal expertise and resources with specialized expertise or intellectual property from third parties to develop new products 
the development of new products for the wan access market requires competence in the general areas of telephony  data networking  network management and wireless telephony as well as specific technologies such as digital subscriber lines dsl  integrated services digital networks isdn  frame relay  asynchronous transfer mode atm  and internet protocols ip 
furthermore  the communications industry is characterized by the need to design products that meet industry standards for safety  emissions  and network interconnection 
with new and emerging technologies and service offerings from network service providers  such standards are often changing or unavailable 
as a result  there is a potential for product development delays due to the need for compliance with new or modified standards 
the introduction of new and enhanced products also requires that the company manage transitions from older products in order to minimize disruptions in customer orders  avoid excess inventory of old products  and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer orders 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  introducing or managing the transition to new or enhanced products  or that any such products will be responsive to technological changes or will gain market acceptance 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if the company were to be unsuccessful  or to incur significant delays in developing and introducing such new products or enhancements 
see dependence on recently introduced products and new product development 
compliance with regulations and evolving industry standards 
the market for the company s products is characterized by the need to meet a significant number of communications regulations and standards  some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed 
in the united states  the company s products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and standards established by underwriters laboratories and bell communications research 
for some public carrier services  installed equipment does not fully comply with current industry standards  and this noncompliance must be addressed in the design of the company s products 
standards for new services such as frame relay  performance monitoring services and atm are still evolving 
as these standards evolve  the company will be required to modify its products or develop and support new versions of its products 
the failure of the company s products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry standards could delay introduction of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulatory policies are likely to continue to have a major impact on the pricing of existing as well as new public network services and therefore are expected to affect demand for such services and the telecommunications products that support such services 
tariff rates  whether determined by network service providers or in response to regulatory directives  may affect the cost effectiveness of deploying communication services 
such policies also affect demand for telecommunications equipment  including the company s products 
risks associated with potential acquisitions and joint ventures 
an important element of the company s strategy is to review acquisition prospects and joint venture opportunities that would compliment its existing product offerings  augment its market coverage  enhance its technological capabilities or offer growth opportunities 
transactions of this nature by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  use of cash and or the incurring of debt and the assumption of contingent liabilities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results and or the price of the company s common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has limited or no prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
joint ventures entail risks such as potential conflicts of interest and disputes among the participants  difficulties in integrating technologies and personnel  and risks of entering new markets 
the company s management has limited prior experience in assimilating such transactions 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future or to successfully develop any products or technologies that might be contemplated by any future joint venture or similar arrangement  and the failure of the company to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with entry into international markets 
the company to date has had minimal direct sales to customers outside of north america 
the company has little experience in the european and far eastern markets  but intends to expand sales of its products outside of north america and to enter certain international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
conducting business outside of north america is subject to certain risks  including longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent any company sales are denominated in foreign currency  the company s sales and results of operations may also be directly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to sell its products internationally  the company must meet standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries  as well as recommendations of the consultative committee on international telegraph and telephony 
a delay in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  certification of its products in countries outside the united states could delay or preclude the company s marketing and sales efforts in such countries  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of third party claims of infringement 
the network access and telecommunications equipment industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark  and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company 
the company has not conducted a formal patent search relating to the technology used in its products  due in part to the high cost and limited benefits of a formal search 
in addition  since patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the related patent is issued and foreign patent applications generally are not publicly disclosed for at least a portion of the time that they are pending  applications may have been filed which  if issued as patents  could relate to the company s products 
software comprises a substantial portion of the technology in the company s products 
the scope of protection accorded to patents covering software related inventions is evolving and is subject to a degree of uncertainty which may increase the risk and cost to the company if the company discovers third party patents related to its software products or if such patents are asserted against the company in the future 
patents have been granted recently on fundamental technologies in software  and patents may be issued which relate to fundamental technologies incorporated into the company s products 
the company may receive communications from third parties asserting that the company s products infringe or may infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
in its distribution agreements  the company typically agrees to indemnify its customers for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in favor of the company  could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  the company might be required to discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses from third parties 
there can be no assurance that licenses from third parties would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim against the company and the failure of the company to develop or license a substitute technology  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
limited protection of intellectual property 
the company relies upon a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright  and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in its products and technologies 
the company has been issued certain us and canadian patents with respect to limited aspects of its single purpose network access technology 
the company has not obtained significant patent protection for its access system technology 
there can be no assurance that third parties have not or will not develop equivalent technologies or products without infringing the company s patents or that a court having jurisdiction over a dispute involving such patents would hold the company s patents valid and enforceable 
the company has also entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with its employees and independent contractors  and enters into non disclosure agreements with its suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of its proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these statutory and contractual arrangements will deter misappropriation of the company s technologies or discourage independent third party development of similar technologies 
in the event such arrangements are insufficient  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus  make the possibility of misappropriation of the company s technology and products more likely 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at june   the company s investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
additionally  the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and therefore  the company would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in income or cash flows 
the company invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material
