liquidity and capital resources in june  the company amended and restated its secured revolving credit facility with bank of america 
under this facility  which matures june   the company can borrow up to million on a secured basis 
the facility contains an unsecured sub line of million 
secured loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to either the lender s published reference rate or libor plus a margin ranging from to 
the interest rate of the unsecured loans is either the lender s published reference rate or libor plus a margin of

the company was in compliance with the covenants and requirements of its various debt financings throughout the company anticipates that the cash flow generated by its real estate investments and funds available under the above credit facility will be sufficient to meet its short term liquidity requirements

the ability to obtain mortgage loans on income producing property is dependent upon the ability to attract and retain tenants and the economics of the various markets in which the properties are located  as well as the willingness of mortgage lending institutions to make loans secured by real property 
the ability to sell real estate investments is partially dependent upon the ability of purchasers to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates 
potential factors affecting future operating results many factors affect the company s actual financial performance and may cause the company s future results to be markedly outside of the company s current expectations 
these factors include the following interest rate fluctuations at the present time  borrowings under the company s credit facility and the million mortgage loan from union bank bear interest at floating rates 
the company recognizes that its results from operations may be negatively impacted by future increases in interest rates and substantial additional borrowings to finance property acquisitions  development projects and share repurchases 
lease renewals while the company historically has been successful in renewing and reletting space  the company is subject to the risk that certain leases expiring in and beyond may not be renewed  or the terms of renewal may be less favorable to the company than current lease terms 
the company expects to incur costs in making improvements or repairs to its portfolio of properties required by new or renewing tenants and expects to incur expenses associated with brokerage commissions payable in connection with the reletting of space 
inflation most of the leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
inflation  however  could result in an increase in the company s borrowing and other operating expense 
government regulations the company s properties are subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements such as local building codes and other similar regulations 
the company believes its properties are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements  although expenditures at its properties may be required to comply with changes in these laws 
no material expenditures are contemplated at this time in order to comply with any such laws or regulations 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances released on  above  under  or in such property 
such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
the costs of such removal or remediation could be substantial 
additionally  the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner s ability to borrow using such real estate as collateral 
the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local laws regarding hazardous or toxic substances  and the company has not been notified by any governmental authority of any non compliance or other claim in connection with any of its present or former properties 
accordingly  the company does not currently anticipate that compliance with federal  state and local environmental protection regulations will have any material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that future discoveries or events at the company s properties  or changes to current environmental regulations  will not result in such a material adverse impact

ffo generally is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains losses from debt restructurings  sales of property and non recurring items  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures

ffo does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
further  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company s presentation

year compliance the year issue related to the ability of computer systems and programs to recognize and process dates after the year the failure to distinguish between such dates could have had detrimental effects on business critical systems and could have caused disruptions in building services  such as security systems  hvac building automation  and energy management systems 
in the first quarter of  the company formed a year project team which includes the chief operating officer coo  legal counsel  information systems is consultants  and property managers

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives the company balances its borrowings between fixed and variable rate debt 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in thousands fair thereafter total value variable rate libor debt     average interest rate fixed rate debt         average interest rate as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates
