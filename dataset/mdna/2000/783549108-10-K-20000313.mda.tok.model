eliminations reflect the elimination of revenue for these services and sales 
years ended december in thousands operating expense    percentage of revenue operating expense increased percent in compared with the increase was attributable to higher compensation and employee benefit expenses  outside driver costs  vehicle liability and technology costs primarily as a result of higher business volumes  as well as higher fuel costs as a result of increasing fuel prices  particularly in the second half of equipment rental costs have also increased because of sale leaseback transactions  totaling approximately million over the last months 
the increase in operating expense as a percentage of revenue in was attributable to the impact of increased equipment rental costs 
this growth trend in operating expense as a percentage of revenue should continue in given the full year impact of sale leaseback transactions completed in as well as expected transactions 
operating expense increased percent in compared with the increase was attributable to higher compensation and employee benefit expenses  outside driver costs  maintenance  technology and workers compensation costs primarily as a result of higher business volumes

the company periodically reviews and adjusts the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values 
these factors served to offset the impact on depreciation expense from the growth in the average size of the full service lease and commercial rental fleets 
gains on vehicle sales also decreased percent in  compared with  due to a decrease in the average gain per vehicle sold  which offset a percent increase in the number of vehicles sold 
the reduced average gains reflect the overall increased carrying value of vehicles at the date of disposition and a changing mix of vehicles sold and disposal methods 
average proceeds per vehicle sold in exceeded levels 
depreciation expense increased percent in compared with  reflecting growth in the average size of the full service lease and commercial rental fleets 
gains on vehicle sales increased percent in compared with the increase was due to a higher number of vehicles sold in as well as greater average gain per vehicle sold 
years ended december in thousands interest expense    percentage of revenue interest expense decreased percent in  compared with  due primarily to debt reductions associated with the use of proceeds from the sale of the public transportation services business and the impact of sale leaseback transactions completed since december these factors offset the impact of higher average outstanding debt levels  particularly during the second and third quarters of  primarily from increased levels of capital spending 
interest expense increased percent in compared with as higher average outstanding debt levels were only partially offset by lower average interest rates 
the higher outstanding debt levels resulted primarily from increased levels of capital spending 
years ended december in thousands miscellaneous income  net    miscellaneous income decreased slightly in  compared with  due primarily to increased costs associated with a higher volume of trade receivable sales during the year  particularly during the second and third quarters 
this cost increase was virtually offset by increased gains from the sale of surplus non operating properties

operating results by business segment years ended december dollars in thousands revenue transportation services full service lease and programmed maintenance    commercial rental    fuel    other    integrated logistics    international    eliminations    total revenue    earnings before income taxes transportation services    integrated logistics    international  eliminations    total reportable segments    other  primarily corporate administrative expense    restructuring and other charges   year expense    total earnings before income taxes    vehicle fleet size owned and leased continuing operations transportation services full service lease    commercial rental    service vehicles    international    integrated logistics includes vehicles not yet earning revenue    no longer earning revenue    the company evaluates financial performance based upon several factors  of which the primary measure is business segment earnings before income taxes and unusual items such as restructuring and other charges and year expense 
business segment earnings before income taxes represent the total profit earned from each segment s clients across all of the company s segments and include allocations of certain overhead costs 
these results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent stand alone entity during the periods presented 
integrated logistics revenue from integrated logistics increased percent in compared with  due primarily to expansion of revenue from existing clients and start up of business sold in the previous year 
the expansions and new start ups were across the automotive  high tech  consumer products and telecommunications industry groups 
dedicated contract carriage services grew only slightly in compared with due to lost business and pricing pressures  particularly during the first half of a large component of growth in came from logistics contracts where the company managed the transportation of freight and subcontracted the delivery of products to third parties 
operating revenue which excludes subcontracted freight costs increased percent in compared with new business sales were strong in  continuing a trend that began in the latter half of business sales  after reflecting the impact of contracts not renewed  increased over percent in compared with  due primarily to lower levels of lost business 
management continues to believe that improved sales force capabilities  industry segmentation and the ability to leverage rapidly emerging logistics technologies should result in continued new sales growth for in light of the timing of the start up of business sales  revenue growth rates in are not expected to significantly exceed current levels 
integrated logistics pretax earnings decreased percent in to million compared with million in pretax earnings as a percentage of operating revenue also decreased to percent in from percent in pretax earnings in were impacted by numerous factors including lower margins on volume sensitive accounts and increased operating expenses on several start up accounts 
integrated logistics also experienced increased outside driver costs as part of dedicated contract carriage and higher litigation and settlement costs 
finally  overhead and technology costs also grew to support product development and marketing initiatives 
revenue from integrated logistics increased percent in compared with operating revenue increased percent in compared with revenue growth was impacted by the termination of two large accounts 
adjusting for these accounts  total revenue and operating revenue would have increased percent and percent  respectively  in compared with pretax earnings increased percent in compared with pretax earnings as a percentage of operating revenue also increased to percent in from percent in these improvements were due primarily to increased operating efficiencies  lower overhead spending  improved pricing in new and existing contracts and  to a lesser extent  the growth in revenue 
transportation services the primary product lines of transportation services consist of full service leasing  programmed maintenance and commercial rental of trucks  tractors and trailers 
revenue in the transportation services segment increased percent in compared with and decreased percent in compared with the results for both years were impacted by fluctuations in fuel revenue 
dry revenue revenue excluding fuel increased percent in compared with due primarily to growth in full service leasing and programmed maintenance 
dry revenue increased percent in compared with due primarily to growth in commercial rental revenue 
fuel revenue increased percent in compared with  as a result of higher worldwide fuel prices  particularly in the latter half of  which offset slightly lower fuel volumes 
fuel revenue decreased percent in compared with as a result of both lower fuel prices and volume 
other transportation services revenue  consisting of non contractual third party maintenance  trailer rentals and other ancillary revenue to support product lines  increased percent in and percent in  compared with prior years 
transportation services pretax earnings decreased percent in to million compared with million in earnings before income taxes as a percentage of dry revenue also decreased to percent in  compared with percent in the decline in pretax earnings was due primarily to reduced operating efficiencies in commerical rental  higher compensation  environmental and vehicle liability expenses  the overall margin impact of lost business and the continuing delays of in service and out service processing of lease vehicles 
transportation services pretax earnings increased percent in compared with earnings before income taxes as a percentage of dry revenue also improved to percent in  compared with percent in the improvement resulted from higher revenue and operating margins in both product lines  particularly commercial rental  which more than offset increased overhead spending for technology and marketing initiatives 
full service leasing 
full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue increased percent in compared with and continues to be impacted by non renewals and delays associated with the in service processing of vehicles 
in  the average level of vehicles not yet earning revenue exceeded levels by percent 
new lease sales in were comparable to levels 
based on the level of non renewals as well as the status of in servicing efforts  management does not expect lease revenue growth rates in to substantially exceed rates 
operating margin revenue less direct operating expenses  depreciation and interest expense from full service leasing increased in compared with  primarily as a result of revenue growth 
operating margin as a percentage of revenue remained the same for and as lower vehicle maintenance costs were offset by increased depreciation and interests costs associated with the in servicing delays previously discussed as well as out servicing delays related to vehicles no longer earning revenue 
as of december   vehicles in the out servicing process totaled  compared with  last year 
management does not expect operating margins in to exceed amounts until the average number of vehicles not earning revenue is reduced to historical levels 
full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue increased percent in compared with new lease sales for were significantly higher than new lease sales in the benefits of strong lease sales in were partially offset by in servicing delays  including extended manufacturers delivery times for new vehicle purchases 
however  the impact of delays in delivery did begin to lessen during the second half of operating margin and operating margin as a percentage of revenue from full service leasing were up slightly in  compared with  as revenue growth on a larger fleet was offset by higher vehicle maintenance costs  principally on older units 
commercial rental 
commercial rental revenue increased percent in compared with due primarily to a larger commercial rental fleet 
vehicle utilization in remained strong  but was lower than the growth in commercial rental revenue included increased rentals from full service lease clients awaiting delivery of new lease equipment 
such awaiting new lease rental revenue increased million  or percent  to million in  compared with however  the growth in this ancillary service slowed in  particularly in the second half of the year due to conversions to full service lease as well as unfavorable comparisons to last year s second half 
management expects this trend to continue in the company also adjusts fleet levels in response to seasonal demands  utilization targets and projected future spending 
the commercial rental product line continues to be sensitive to the overall condition of the us economy and rental results will depend to a great extent on the strength of the economy 
in light of all of these factors  management does not expect year commercial rental revenue to grow at rates 
commercial rental operating margin increased in compared with  reflecting continued strong  but lower  utilization of a larger average fleet 
operating margin as a percentage of revenue decreased in compared with reflecting lower fleet utilization 
commercial rental revenue in increased percent  compared with  due to strong utilization of a larger fleet 
utilization levels reflect  in part  increased demand from full service lease clients particularly while awaiting delivery of new full service lease vehicles 
such awaiting new lease rental revenue increased million  or percent  to million in compared with commercial rental operating margin and operating margin as a percentage of revenue were significantly higher in  compared with  as a result of higher vehicle utilization 
international international segment revenue decreased percent in compared with  due primarily to the impact of the economic difficulties in brazil and argentina and revenue reductions in uk truck leasing and rental 
these factors offset revenue gains in mexico and the uk logistics operations 
the year to date revenue growth also includes the impact of the acquisition of the remaining interest in companhia transportadora e comercial translor  sa translor  a brazilian logistics company that was fully consolidated in may international segment revenue grew percent in compared with the revenue growth in resulted primarily from the may acquisition of the remaining interest in translor  however  revenue improvements were made in every country 
the revenue growth also reflected the impact of a ground equipment maintenance contract with british airways that commenced in the uk during the second quarter of pretax results in the international segment were break even in and compared with earnings of million in the international results in the last two years were impacted by operating losses in uk logistics and european carrier management as a result of volume shortfalls  operating inefficiencies and several unprofitable client contracts 
latin american results were also adversely impacted by the general economic problems experienced in the region during the last two years 
at this time  there are no significant legal restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash flows to the us from the foreign countries where the company is currently operating 
corporate administrative expenses and other net corporate administrative expenses and other totaled million in compared with million in and million in the increase in net corporate administrative expenses and other reflected higher corporate spending and lower gains relative to the prior year 
these factors were mitigated somewhat by additional corporate level interest income as a result of debt reductions made with proceeds from the sale of the public transportation services business 
the decrease in net corporate administrative expenses and other was due primarily to gains from the sale of surplus non operating properties and the reinsurance of certain vehicle related liabilities 
discontinued operations years ended december in thousands income from discontinued operations    gain on sale of discontinued operations   on september   the company completed the sale of its public transportation services business for million in cash and realized a million after tax gain per diluted common share 
on september   the company completed the sale of its automotive carrier business for million in cash and realized a million after tax gain per diluted common share 
earnings from the public transportation services business totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
earnings from the automotive carrier business totaled million in the results of the public transportation services business reflect the unfavorable comparisons associated with selling the unit in mid september  particularly the impact on student transportation that is not fully productive until that time when the school year resumes 
the student transportation business also experienced reduced profitability because of higher driver recruiting and compensation costs in several regions due to labor shortages and increased vehicle liability costs 
the decrease in earnings  compared with  was due to increased maintenance  safety and termination costs associated with several public transit and fleet maintenance contracts which more than offset improvements in student transportation services achieved as a result of revenue growth and fleet efficiencies

these proceeds offset a percent increase in capital expenditures 
the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to higher capital expenditures  which were partially offset by the sale and operating leaseback of revenue earning equipment in additionally  investing activities included the sale of the automotive carrier business which generated proceeds of million 
the following is a summary of capital expenditures years ended december in thousands revenue earning equipment transportation services    international    operating property and equipment    capital spending for was consistent with management s expectations of anticipated growth and fleet replacement in full service leasing and commercial rental 
however  capital spending was significantly above plan during the first half of  which reflected higher than anticipated requirements for replacement lease equipment and new lease sales 
during the second half of  management reviewed capital spending requirements and undertook several actions to slow the rate of spending 
in  capital expenditures in full service truck leasing increased million to billion 
capital expenditures for commercial rental were million in  an increase of million compared with  due to a planned shift in fleet mix and fleet replacement to reduce the average age of the commercial rental fleet

the exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations 
the company s interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio 
the company targets variable rate debt levels at to percent of total financing obligations  including the present value of off balance sheet obligations such as operating leases 
from time to time  the company also uses interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage its fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of its debt instruments to that of its portfolio of assets 
no interest rate swap or cap agreements were outstanding at december  and the following tables summarize debt obligations outstanding as of december  and expressed in us dollar equivalents 
the tables show the amount of debt and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates

the company manages its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk related to foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies 
the company also uses foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements to preserve the carrying value of foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions 
no foreign currency option contracts or forward agreements were outstanding at december  and the company does not generally hedge the translation exposure related to its net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
based on the overall level of transactions denominated in other than local currencies and of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries  the exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates is not material 
the exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to fixed price fuel sales commitments with certain customers 
the company mitigates this exposure by entering into forward purchases for delivery at fueling facilities 
fixed price fuel arrangements represent less than percent of total fuel purchases 
environmental matters the operations of the company involve storing and dispensing petroleum products  primarily diesel fuel  regulated under environmental protection laws 
these laws require the company to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment 
in response to these requirements  the company has upgraded operating facilities and implemented various programs to detect and minimize contamination 
capital expenditures related to these programs totaled million in and million in the company also incurred million of environmental expenses in  compared with million in and the increase in expenses for reflected the impact of lower claim recoveries compared with in  the company also increased the previous accrual for a current site as a result of the ongoing evaluation of the contamination and alternative cleanup methods 
based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations  environmental expenses should not increase materially from levels in the near term 
the ultimate cost of the company s environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors  primarily the level of contamination  the effectiveness of selected remediation methods  the stage of management s investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties 
based upon information presently available  management believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters  although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity 
see the environmental matters note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a further discussion 
year the year issue was the result of computer systems  software products and embedded technology using two digits rather than four to indicate the applicable year and the resultant inability to properly interpret dates beyond the year during  after consideration of the potential impact to operations  including client and supplier relationships  an enterprise wide program was initiated to modify computer information systems to be year compliant or to replace noncompliant systems 
the cumulative impact on after tax earnings for incremental year costs was million 
the company did not experience any material adverse effects in its operating or business systems when the date changed from to additionally  the company currently is not aware of any significant year problems that have arisen for its clients and suppliers 
euro conversion on january   the participating countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
the participating countries existing national currencies will continue as legal tender until at least january  during this transition period  parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the participating country s legacy currency 
due to the nature of current international operations  conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires all derivatives to be recognized at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
any gain or loss resulting from changes in such fair value is required to be recognized in earnings to the extent the derivatives are not effective as hedges 
this statement  as amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and is effective for interim periods in the initial year of adoption 
adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
outlook the divestiture of the public transportation services business has heightened and renewed the company s focus on logistics and transportation services 
in  the company will leverage this focus with a new organizational structure that will enhance client service and business retention across the product line continuum 
the new organizational structure should provide growth opportunities through the expanded access to and awareness of existing logistics capabilities 
the company will emphasize growing revenue and margin in logistics and transportation services through continued strong new sales and focus on client loyalty and retention  better asset utilization  rationed capital spending and overall cost containment to enhance productivity 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are based on the current plans and expectations of ryder system  inc and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause such differences include  among others  general economic conditions in the united states and worldwide  the highly competitive environment applicable to the company s operations including competition in integrated logistics from other logistics companies as well as from air cargo  shipping  railroads and motor carriers and competition in full service leasing and commercial rental from companies providing similar services as well as from truck and trailer manufacturers who provide leasing  extended warranty maintenance  rental and other transportation services  greater than expected expenses associated with the company s personnel needs or activities including increased cost of freight and transportation  availability of equipment  changes in clients business environments or the loss of a significant client or changes in government regulations 
the risks included here are not exhaustive 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on the company s business
