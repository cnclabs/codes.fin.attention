impact of the year on system processing the year yk problem concerned the inability of information systems to property recognize and process date sensitive information beyond january  as a result  the yk problem could have affected any system that uses date data  including mainframes  pcs  and embedded microprocessors that control security systems  call processing systems  building climate systems  elevators  office equipment and even fire alarms 
since january   the company has not experienced any disruption to its business operations as a result of yk compliance problems 
one software application displayed the wrong date in a non critical field 
the date display is purely cosmetic and an updated version will be installed during the first quarter of the company s state of readiness the company began addressing the yk issue in september as such it divided its review into two segments business critical and mission critical systems 
business critical systems are those with the potential to affect the financial and operational infrastructure of the company 
mission critical are those systems with a potential to affect the delivery of electricity and natural gas to our residents  commercial tenants and employees and the safety of residents  commercial tenants and employees 
recognizing that the mission critical systems rely heavily on public service vendors  the company s focus was on business critical systems under the assumption that market forces and regulatory agencies would encourage and monitor the compliance of the telecommunications  utilities and emergency service industries 
the company set up systems to monitor the progress of mission critical service providers and developed contingency plans to minimize the possibility that the yk problem would disrupt the lives of its residents  commercial tenants and employees 
the company relies exclusively on micro computers pc s 
pc s exist in the corporate office  regional offices and at the communities 
the company completed its review and modification of corporate  regional and community office systems towards yk compliance in november  the company had one and one half full time employees dedicated to upgrading regional offices and community based systems 
additional information systems employees assisted as needed 
throughout  the company plans to periodically match its systems inventory against hardware and software component manufacturer upgrade releases to assure that its systems have the most current yk upgrades including any properties acquired 
to insure delivery of goods and services ie  building and elevator access  security systems  hvac  life safety  etc 
to the company s communities and without interruption  the company mailed surveys to all critical suppliers in july  all critical suppliers indicated their expected compliance 
costs the cost of the company s yk activities  which was budgeted at  totaled approximately  environmental issues phase i environmental audits have been completed on substantially all of the owned properties 
there are no recorded amounts resulting from environmental liabilities as there are no known contingencies with respect thereto 
furthermore  no condition is known to exist that would give rise to a material liability for site restoration or other costs that may be incurred with respect to the sale or disposal of a property 
recent accounting pronouncements the company is not aware of any pronouncements which would have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
inflation substantially all of the leases at the communities are for a term of one year or less  which enables the company to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases 
these short term leases minimize the potential adverse effect of inflation on rental income  although residents may leave without penalty at the end of their lease terms and may do so if rents are increased significantly
