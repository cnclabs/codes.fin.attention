overview the company was organized in november  as a delaware corporation and remains a development stage enterprise 
e 
khashoggi industries llc  the company s principal stockholder  or its predecessors eki  has been involved since july  in the development of various new material technologies including the new composite material 
the company was formed to develop  license and commercialize foodservice disposables made of earthshell composite material earthshell products 
the company has an exclusive  worldwide  royalty free license from eki to use certain technology for this purpose 
the company intends to continue to license or joint venture with existing manufacturers of foodservice disposables for the manufacture and distribution of earthshell products 
the company expects to derive revenues primarily from license royalties and distributions from joint ventures that are licensed to manufacture earthshell products 
the company has experienced aggregate net losses of approximately million from its inception on november  through december  the company has been unprofitable to date and expects to continue to incur operating losses until its products are commercially introduced and achieve broader market acceptance and market penetration 
since its inception  the company has not generated any revenues from operations 
successful future operations will depend upon the ability of the company  its licensees and joint venture partners to commercialize multiple earthshell products 
prior to the company s initial public offering in march  in which the company raised net proceeds of million  the company financed its operations from inception primarily through the private placement of preferred stock and loans from its principal stockholder  eki  and imperial bank

development of first commercial manufacturing facility 
the development and installation of the company s first commercial manufacturing lines at sweetheart cup company inc s sweetheart owings mills  maryland facility has been the company s major focus since sweetheart secured the perseco the primary packaging purchasing agent for mcdonald s corporation supply agreement for earthshell containers for the big mac registered trademark sandwich in october following the company s initial public offering in early and in cooperation with sweetheart  the company contracted for the design and construction of commercial scale earthshell manufacturing lines to meet projected demand under the perseco mcdonald s supply contract 
in late  the company began the process of debugging and startup of the first of these manufacturing lines 
the debugging and startup of the first line has taken longer than originally anticipated 
one of the primary causes of the delay has been the failure of a high speed conveyor segment to meet its original performance specifications 
a new conveyor segment was designed  installed  and placed in operation in early november the new conveyor section is functioning as required and the company is operating the entire line to produce commercial products to meet the immediate demand for validation testing 
the company is proceeding to start up the second line 
previously  the company had developed a contingency plan to ensure that it would have adequate capacity to meet the anticipated perseco mcdonald s rollout schedule 
based on recent progress  the company no longer believes it will be necessary to install additional capacity to meet the commitment for the big mac registered trademark sandwich container
