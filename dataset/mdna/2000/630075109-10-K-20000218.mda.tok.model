overview we integrate advanced microelectronics and molecular biology into a core technology platform with broad and diverse commercial applications in the fields of genomics  biomedical research  medical diagnostics  drug discovery  forensics  agriculture  environmental testing and potentially the electronics and telecommunications industries 
the first application we have developed is an integrated bioassay system  the nanochip molecular biology workstation  comprised of two automated instruments and a consumable cartridge 
the nanochip cartridge incorporating a proprietary microchip provides a flexible tool for the rapid identification and precision analysis of biological test samples containing charged molecules 
since commencing operations in  we have applied substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
we have incurred losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant losses over at least the next few years as we continue our research and product development efforts and attempt to commercialize our products 
we plan to introduce our first product into the marketplace in the second half of we anticipate our main sources of revenues through at least will be payments under our sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants 
we believe our future operating results may be subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the achievement of milestones under our collaborative agreements  whether and when new products are successfully developed and introduced by us or our competitors  and market acceptance of products under development 
payments under sponsored research agreements may be subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount and therefore our results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the results of operations for any other period 
results of operations years ended december    and revenue for the year ended december   revenue from sponsored research totaled million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues are recorded under these arrangements as expenses are incurred 
payments received in advance under these arrangements are recorded as deferred revenue until the expenses are incurred 
sponsored research revenue recognized during the years ended december  and was earned in connection with our joint venture collaboration with becton dickinson  our research and development agreement with aventis and our nonexclusive research and development agreement with elan 
we and becton dickinson are considering modifications to the joint venture to take advantage of potential third party opportunities on technology developed to date  as well as field changes which would allow the joint venture access to additional technologies or content in areas more strategically aligned with business opportunities 
further joint venture funding will be determined based on a final decision regarding such modifications and field charges 
we have received no funding from becton dickinson since the third quarter of  and are uncertain as to whether we will receive any additional funding from becton dickinson 
nanogen and aventis have added management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations two new technology development programs to the existing molecular recognition array development program 
the two new programs will provide a maximum of million in additional funding to us through december   including an up front initiation fee of million which was received during and recorded as deferred revenue 
nanogen and elan have not yet agreed upon specific program objectives with respect to their nonexclusive research and development program 
we are uncertain if we will receive any additional funds from elan 
sponsored research revenue recognized during the year ended december  was earned in connection with a research agreement with becton dickinson effective in may which was subsequently superceded by the joint venture collaboration entered into in october we fund some of our research and development efforts through contracts and grants awarded by various federal and state agencies 
revenues are recognized under these contracts and grants as expenses are incurred 
continuation of sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants is dependent upon us achieving specific contractual milestones 
the recognition of revenue under sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants may vary from quarter to quarter and may result in significant fluctuations in operating results from year to year 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million during the year ended december  from million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses include salaries  lab supplies  consulting  travel  facilities  product design and prototype development  and other expenditures relating to research and product development 
the increases from year to year are attributable to costs associated with the development and refinement of engineering prototypes as we move toward commercialization of our first product 
additionally  the increases are attributable to the continued growth of research and product development efforts  including hiring of additional scientific  engineering and operations personnel  increased purchases of laboratory supplies  equipment and services to support our sponsored research programs  and expansion of research and development facilities 
research and development spending may increase over the next several years as our research and product development efforts continue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the year to year increases from through are primarily due to increased personnel costs as the company expands its general and administrative organization  legal costs associated with enhancing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio  the expansion of activities related to marketing our potential products  increased costs associated with operating as a public company  and to additional deferred compensation expense recognized during the year ended december  compared to and deferred compensation represents the excess of the fair value for financial statement presentation purposes over the exercise price for common stock issuable on exercise of stock options 
the increase in compared to is also due in part to severance costs related to certain employees 
general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase as we expand our sales and marketing and general and administrative organizations and as we continue to enhance and maintain our intellectual property portfolio 
acquired in process technology during the first quarter of  we issued  shares of our series d convertible preferred stock at per share in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of nanotronics  inc this series d preferred stock converted into  shares of common stock at our initial public offering 
the in process management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations technology acquired relates generally to nanotechnology and molecular electronics 
we recorded million in expenses relating to acquired in process technology during the year ended december  interest income expense  net we had net interest income of million in compared to net interest income of million and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in net interest income for compared to can be attributed to lower cash balances during compared to  as a result of cash used in operations 
the significant increase in compared to was primarily attributable to larger cash balances resulting from net proceeds received upon the completion of our initial public offering and concurrent private placement of equity securities in april interest expense increased during compared to and  due to greater amounts of equipment under capital leases in than in and equity in loss of joint venture we recognized a loss of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  from the joint venture formed in with becton dickinson  based on the loss allocation described in the joint venture agreement which states that losses will be allocated in proportion to and not to exceed cash contributions 
there was no loss during as no cash contributions were made by us to the joint venture during the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources in april  we completed our initial public offering of common stock generating net proceeds of million 
concurrent with the initial public offering  we completed a private placement of our equity securities with becton dickinson  aventis and elan for net proceeds of million  million and million  respectively 
prior to our initial public offering  we had financed our operations primarily through the net proceeds received from private placements of preferred equity securities totaling million 
we fund most of our equipment acquisitions and leasehold improvements through capital leasing facilities 
during  we received proceeds from equipment and leasehold improvement financing of  compared to million and million of proceeds received during and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to use capital equipment leasing or debt facilities to fund most of our equipment acquisitions and leasehold improvements 
as of december   we had million of available funding under our equipment lease lines 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
cash used for operations was primarily related to the costs associated with developing prototypes of our initial product  the support of our expanding operations  including higher personnel costs  and legal fees relating to establishing and maintaining our intellectual property rights 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we expect that the proceeds of this offering and our existing capital resources  combined with anticipated revenues from potential product sales  sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants will be sufficient to support our planned operations through at least the next three years 
this estimate of the period for which we expect our available sources of liquidity to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially 
our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the extent to which our products under development are successfully developed and gain market acceptance  the timing of regulatory actions regarding our potential products  the costs and timing of expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities  prosecution and enforcement of patents important to our business  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the results of clinical trials  competitive developments  and our ability to maintain existing collaborations and to enter into additional collaborative arrangements 
we have incurred negative cash flow from operations since inception and do not expect to generate positive cash flow to fund our operations for at least the next several years 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund our research and development programs  to scale up manufacturing activities and expand our sales and marketing efforts to support the commercialization of our products under development 
additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into collaborative agreements or other arrangements on unfavorable terms 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in january  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of nanotronics 
the in process technology  which was acquired as a result of our purchase of nanotronics  relates generally to nanotechnology and molecular electronics 
potential applications of the technology include high density optical storage systems for electronics applications and self assembly applications relating to microfabrication and nanofabrication 
nanotronics research is exploratory in nature and at a very early stage 
if technological feasibility is demonstrated  we expect to pursue corporate partnership opportunities 
given the early stage of the technology  we have not yet determined which applications may be developed and the extent of our resources to be committed to each such application 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had federal and california net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of million and million  respectively  and million and million of research and development  or r d  tax credits available to offset future federal and state income taxes  respectively 
the federal and california nol carryforwards are subject to alternative minimum tax limitations and to examination by the tax authorities 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will begin expiring in  unless previously utilized  and the california tax loss carryforwards will continue to expire in  unless previously utilized 
the federal and california r d tax credit carryforwards will begin expiring in unless previously utilized 
we believe that our initial public offering combined with the concurrent private placement  which occurred in april  may constitute a change of ownership under federal income tax regulations 
as such  we may be limited in the amount of nols incurred prior to our initial public offering  which may be utilized to offset future taxable income 
similar limitations may also apply to utilization of r d tax credits to offset taxes payable 
however  we do not believe such limitations will have a material impact on our ability to utilize the nols 
see note of notes to financial statements 
year compliance in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we expensed less than  during in connection with remediating our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products under development  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company invests its excess cash primarily in us government securities and marketable debt securities of financial institutions and corporations with strong credit ratings 
these instruments have maturities of three months or less when acquired 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the instruments we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments
