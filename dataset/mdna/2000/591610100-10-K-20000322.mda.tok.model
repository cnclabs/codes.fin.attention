item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information contained elsewhere in this form k 
general we are engaged primarily in the development  production and worldwide distribution of theatrical motion pictures and television programming 
see item business 
sources of revenue the principal sources of motion picture industry revenue are the domestic and international distribution of motion pictures  including theatrical exhibition  home video and television network  syndication  basic cable  pay and pay per view 
over the last decade  the relative contributions of these components of revenues have changed dramatically 
although revenues from domestic theatrical distribution have increased  growth in total motion picture industry revenues has resulted predominantly from increased revenues derived from the distribution of motion pictures internationally as well as from other media and distribution channels 
our feature films are exploited through a series of sequential domestic and international distribution channels  typically beginning with theatrical exhibition 
thereafter  feature films are first made available for home video generally six months after theatrical release  for pay television  one year after theatrical release  and for syndication  approximately three to five years after theatrical release 
our television programming is produced for initial broadcast on either pay  syndicated or network television in the united states  followed by international territories and  in some cases  worldwide video markets 
we distribute our motion picture and television productions in foreign countries and  in recent years  have derived approximately percent of our revenues from foreign sources 
approximately percent of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  we incur certain operating and production costs in foreign currencies 
as a result  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our business  results of operations and cash flows 
we  in certain instances  enter into foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the value of our firm commitments and certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
these contracts generally mature within one year 
we do not enter into foreign currency contracts for speculative purposes 
realized gains and losses on contracts that hedge anticipated future cash flows were not material in any of the periods presented herein 
we had no significant foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at december  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
cost structure general 
in the motion picture industry  the largest component of the cost of producing a motion picture generally is the negative cost  which includes the above the line and below the line costs of producing the film 
above the line costs are costs related to the acquisition of picture rights and the costs associated with the producer  the director  the writer and the principal cast 
below the line costs are the remaining costs involved in producing the picture  such as film studio rental  principal photography  sound and editing 
distribution expenses consist primarily of the costs of advertising and preparing release prints 
the costs of advertising associated with a major domestic theatrical motion picture release are significant and typically involve national and target market media campaigns  as well as public appearances of a film s stars 
these advertising costs are separate from the advertising costs associated with other domestic distribution channels and the international market 
the major studios generally fund production costs from cash flow generated by motion picture and related distribution activities or bank and other financing methods 
over the past decade  expenses in the motion picture industry have increased rapidly as a result of increased production costs and distribution expenses 
additionally  each of the major studios must fund substantial overhead costs  consisting primarily of salaries and related costs of the production  distribution and administrative staffs  as well as facilities costs and other recurring overhead 
participations and residuals 
in connection with the production and distribution of a motion picture  major studios generally grant contractual rights to actors  directors  screenwriters  producers and other creative and financial contributors to share in the gross receipts or contractually defined net profits from a particular motion picture 
except for the most sought after talent  these third party participations are generally payable after all distribution fees  marketing expenses  direct production costs and financing costs are fully recouped 
major studios also typically incur obligations to pay residuals to various guilds and unions including the writers guild of america  the directors guild of america and the screen actors guild 
the residual payments are made on a picture by picture basis with respect to the exploitation of a motion picture in markets other than the primary intended markets for such picture and are calculated as a percentage of the gross revenues derived from the exploitation of the picture in these ancillary markets 
our cost structure for motion pictures generally follows the industry structure described above 
for a discussion of television programming cost structure  see item business the motion picture and television industry 
industry accounting practices revenue recognition 
revenues from theatrical distribution of feature motion pictures are recognized on the dates of exhibition 
revenues from home video distribution  together with related costs  are recognized in the period in which the product is available assuming it has been shipped for sale at the retail level 
under revenue sharing arrangements  we also participate in consumer rental revenues generated in the home video market by rental establishments 
revenues from television distribution are recognized when the motion picture or television program is available to the licensee for broadcast 
accounting for motion picture and television costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and industry practice  we amortize film and television programming costs using the individual film forecast method under which such costs are amortized for each film or television program in the ratio that revenue earned in the current period for such title bears to management s estimate of the total revenues to be realized from all media and markets for such title 
management regularly reviews  and revises when necessary  its total revenue estimates on a title by title basis  which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and or a write down of the film or television asset to net realizable value 
these revisions can result in significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in film write downs and amortization 
a typical film or television program recognizes a substantial portion of its ultimate revenues within the first two years of release 
by then  a film has been exploited in the domestic and international theatrical markets and the domestic and international home video markets  as well as the domestic and international pay television and pay per view markets  and a television program has been exploited on network television or in first run syndication 
a similar portion of the film s or television program s capitalized costs should be expected to be amortized accordingly  assuming the film or television program is profitable 
the commercial potential of individual motion pictures and television programming varies dramatically  and is not directly correlated with production or acquisition costs 
therefore  it is difficult to predict or project a trend of our income or loss 
however  the likelihood that we report losses  particularly in the year of a motion picture s release  is increased by the industry s method of accounting which requires the immediate recognition of the entire loss through increased amortization in instances where it is estimated the ultimate revenues of a motion picture or television program will not recover our costs 
on the other hand  the profit of a profitable motion picture or television program must be deferred and recognized over the entire revenue stream generated by that motion picture or television program 
this method of accounting may also result in significant fluctuations in reported income or loss  particularly on a quarterly basis  depending on our release schedule and the relative performance of individual motion pictures or television programs 
for films we released since january which resulted in feature film write downs in the period of initial release  subsequent performance as it relates to this group of films has not resulted in additional material write downs 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued an exposure draft on a proposed statement of position for accounting by producers and distributors of films 
if adopted  the proposed statement of position would establish new accounting and reporting standards for all producers and distributors that own or hold the rights to distribute or exploit films 
the proposed statement of position provides that the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles caused by adoption of the provisions of the statement of position should be included in the determination of net income in conformity with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes 
because the proposed statement of position has not yet been adopted  we are not able to quantify the effect or the materiality to our financial position or operating results at this time 
if adopted  the proposed statement of position  as currently drafted  would be effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements  including certain criteria for gross versus net recording of sales transactions 
this sab is required to be implemented by us in the first quarter of we are currently determining the effect of this new guidance on the financial statements 
sab no 
allows any required changes to be recorded in accordance with accounting principles board no

ebitda does not reflect cash available to fund cash requirements  and the items excluded from ebitda  such as depreciation and non film amortization  are significant components in assessing our financial performance

our operations are capital intensive

during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  net cash used in investing activities primarily the purchase of the polygram film libraries and additions to film and television costs was million  and net cash provided by financing activities primarily proceeds from our rights offering and bank borrowings was million 
sales of equity securities 
sales of equity securities include proceeds from our initial public offering and tracinda s concurrent purchase of our common stock  which were completed in november  our rights offering  which was completed in november  and our rights offering  which was completed in november our cash flow in was adversely affected by  and we determined to undertake the rights offering as a result of  i lower than expected performance of our theatrical releases in  other than the releases tomorrow never dies and the man in the iron mask  ii more substantial investments in new television programming than previously anticipated  iii cash from certain revenue sources being realized over a longer period than originally anticipated  and iv other factors  including accelerated motion picture production and increased marketing and distribution expenses 
we consummated our rights offering in november by issuing a total of  shares of common stock for per share  and thereby raising net proceeds of million 
the proceeds were used to reduce bank borrowings 
rights offering 
in october  we issued to our common stockholders of record  at no charge to such holders  transferable subscription rights to subscribe for an aggregate of  shares of the common stock for per share 
holders of the common stock received rights for each share of the common stock held as of the record date 
rights holders purchased one share of the common stock at the subscription price for each whole right held 
rights holders who exercised their rights also had the opportunity to purchase additional shares at the subscription price pursuant to an oversubscription privilege  as defined 
the rights expired on november  the total proceeds received from the rights offering were million less applicable fees and expenses of million 
the proceeds were used to repay in full the amounts outstanding under a bridge loan and the revolving facility  with the balance retained as cash for general operating purposes 
bank borrowings 
we have a billion syndicated credit facility consisting of i a six year million revolving credit facility  ii a million seven and one half year term loan and iii a million eight and one half year term loan 
we used a portion of the proceeds from our rights offering to repay all amounts then outstanding under the revolving facility 
as of march   million was available under our credit facility  which also contains provisions allowing  under certain circumstances  for an additional million tranche 
currently  the revolving facility and the million term loan bear interest at percent over the adjusted libor rate  as defined therein percent at march   and the million term loan bears interest at percent over the adjusted libor rate percent at march  
we have entered into three year fixed interest rate swap contracts in relation to a portion of our credit facility for a notional value of million at an average rate of approximately percent  which expire at various times no later than december scheduled amortization of the term loans under our credit facility commences with million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in  with the remaining balance due at maturity 
the revolving facility was entered into in october and matures in october  subject to extension under certain conditions 
our credit facility contains various covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  dividends and capital expenditures  and maintenance of certain financial ratios 
in connection with the million charge resulting from the early termination of the warner home video agreement  our credit facility was amended  effective april  as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
there can be no assurances that we will remain in compliance with such covenants or other conditions under our credit facility in the future 
we anticipate substantial continued borrowing under our credit facility 
cash provided by operating activities 
in the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in the year ended december  in march  in consideration for the early expiration of the warner home video agreement  we agreed to pay warner home video million  million of which was paid on march  and the remainder of which  plus interest  was paid on september  we recorded a pre tax contract termination charge in the year ended december  for the million payment referred to above in connection with terminating the warner home video agreement 
cash used in investing activities 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million 
in the year ended december   we incurred million in film and television costs 
in january  we acquired the polygram library  containing over  feature films  for million  plus acquisition related costs of approximately million 
the purchase was funded by borrowings under the revolving facility and available cash 
anticipated needs 
our current strategy and business plan call for substantial on going investments in the production of new feature films and television programs 
furthermore  we may wish to continue to make investments in new distribution channels to further exploit our motion picture and television library 
we plan to continue to evaluate the level of such investments in the context of the capital available to us and changing market conditions 
we incurred approximately million of additional costs in in connection with the integration of the polygram library and our transition to home video self distribution in the us and canadian markets 
we do not expect our obligations for property and equipment expenditures  including the purchase of computer systems and equipment and other improvements  to exceed million per year 
in connection with our termination of the warner home video agreement  we anticipate that the worldwide home video distribution rights reconveyed to turner will decrease our cash flow by approximately million per year through june we are obligated to fund percent of the expenses of mgm networks latin america up to a maximum of approximately million 
we have funded approximately million under such obligation as of december   and expect to fund an additional million in in june  in association with a change in our senior management and a corresponding review of our operations  we incurred certain restructuring  severance and other charges aggregating million for the year ended december   of which million was film performance related and million reflected severance and other costs  including the estimated costs of withdrawing from the company s arrangements with united international pictures no later than november  as of december   we have utilized of the film performance related reserves and have paid million of the severance and other costs 
as a result of the change in senior management  we did not commence production as anticipated under our business plan 
therefore  we expect to release a reduced number of major films in the first six months of  which may adversely impact cash flows and results of operations at least through however  as opportunities arise  we will pursue the purchase of feature films from third parties that could be released during this period 
we believe that the remaining proceeds from our rights offering  together with amounts available under the revolving facility and cash flow from operations  will be adequate for us to conduct our operations in accordance with our business plan for at least the next twelve months 
this belief is based in part on the assumption that our future releases will perform as planned 
in addition to the foregoing sources of liquidity  we are currently considering various film financing alternatives 
if necessary in order to manage our cash needs  we may also delay or alter production or release schedules or seek to reduce our aggregate investment in new film and television production costs 
there can be no assurance that any such steps would be adequate or timely  or that acceptable arrangements could be reached with third parties if necessary 
in addition  although these steps would improve our short term cash flow and  in the case of partnering  reduce our exposure should a motion picture perform below expectations  such steps could adversely affect long term cash flow and results of operations in subsequent periods 
we intend to continue to pursue our goal of becoming an integrated global entertainment content company 
in connection with our pursuit of this goal  we may consider various strategic alternatives  such as business combinations with companies with strengths complementary to those of ours  other acquisitions and joint ventures  as opportunities arise 
the nature  size and structure of any such transaction could require us to seek additional financing 
impact of the year issue introduction 
the term year issue is a general term used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery with respect to the year period 
these problems generally arise from the fact that most of the world s computer hardware and software have historically used only two digits to identify the year in a date  often meaning that the computer will fail to distinguish dates in the s from dates in the s 
these problems may also arise from other sources as well  such as the use of special codes and conventions in software that make use of the date field 
year conversion 
we completed the year conversion with respect to all of our computer systems and applications 
in addition  we have had communications with certain of our significant suppliers  distributors  financial institutions  lessors and others with which we do business to evaluate their year compliance plans and state of readiness and to determine the extent to which our systems may be affected by the failure of others to remediate their own year issues 
all major critical systems have continued to function correctly and as planned in the year to date  there have been no significant operational problems due to any year issues and based upon this experience and the testing completed prior to december   we do not anticipate that the year issue will have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we will  however  continue to monitor closely the performance of our systems and the year readiness of its critical vendors  suppliers and customers 
costs to address the year issue 
to date  we estimate that we have spent approximately million to address the year issue  with the majority of the work being performed by our employees 
we may identify certain additional costs regarding the year issue 
such additional costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
contingency plans 
we have developed a comprehensive year specific contingency plan that  when used in combination with our general disaster recovery plan  should provide for continued business operations to the greatest extent possible in the unlikely event of the year failure of any of our systems 
as part of our year contingency effort  information received from external sources is examined for date integrity before being brought into our internal systems

certain amounts borrowed under our credit facility are at variable interest rates and we are thus subject to market risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
we enter into interest rate swaps in part to alter interest rate exposures 
interest rate swaps allow us to raise long term borrowings at floating rates and effectively swap them into fixed rates that are lower than those available to us if fixed rate borrowings were made directly 
under interest rate swaps  we agree with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount

we currently intend to continue to enter into such contracts to hedge against future material foreign currency exchange rate risks
