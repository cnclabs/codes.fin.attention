item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general prior year acquisitions the consolidated financial statements and related discussions thereof give retroactive effect to the merger with tpn  inc dba the people s network tpn which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
tpn was merged into the company in a tax free exchange of  shares after adjustment for fractional shares of the company s common stock effective october  additionally  the consolidated balance sheet data reflects the december  acquisition of universal fidelity life insurance company ufl that was accounted for as a purchase transaction and accordingly  none of the operating results of ufl are included in any periods prior to see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional information regarding these acquisitions 
of the shares of company common stock issued in the tpn merger   shares remain in escrow pending the resolution of certain specified contingencies  relating to pending or threatened litigation against tpn at the time of the merger 
membership fees and membership benefit costs the company s principal revenues are derived from membership fees  most of which are collected on a monthly basis 
memberships are generally guaranteed renewable and non cancelable except for fraud  non payment of membership fees or upon written request by the member 
membership benefit costs vary depending on the type of membership 
closed panel plans provide the membership benefits through a designated provider law firm with whom the company has arranged for the services to be provided in a particular geographic area 
provider law firms receive a fixed monthly payment for each member in their service area and are responsible for providing the membership benefits without additional remuneration 
the fixed cost aspect of closed panel plans provides significant advantages to the company in managing its claims risk 
under closed panel plans  the company has the ability to more effectively monitor the quality of legal services provided and  due to the volume of claims that may be directed to particular provider law firms  has access to larger  more diversified law firms 
at december   approximately of the company s memberships were closed panel plans compared to at december  membership benefit costs relating to open panel memberships  which constituted approximately of memberships in force at december   are based on the usual  reasonable and customary fee for providing the required services 
such costs are generally paid on a current basis  as most costs are certain in amount and require only limited investigation 
the company maintains a reserve for estimated incurred but not reported open panel membership benefit costs as well as costs which are in the payment process 
these reserves are reviewed annually by an independent actuary as necessary in conjunction with the preparation and filing of financial statements and other reports with various state insurance regulatory authorities 
underwriting risks associated with the open panel memberships are managed primarily through contractual benefit limitations and  as a result  underwriting decisions are not necessarily based on individual membership purchases 
product sales and product costs product sales consist primarily of the sale of personal and home care products  jewelry  books  audiocassettes and videotapes focusing on personal achievement 
other products and services include digital satellite television subscriptions  internet access and web sites  long distance and travel services provided by business partners 
the company has certain alliances with business partners  whereby sales associates buy products or services provided by such business partners and in return  the company receives commissions on the sales of such goods and services 
revenues from these transactions are included in product sales in the statement of income 
product costs consist primarily of the actual cost paid to acquire such goods and services 
costs to purchase products and deliver services are included in product costs in the statement of income commissions beginning with new memberships written after march   the company implemented a level commission schedule which results in the company incurring commission expense related to the sale of its legal expense plans on a basis more consistent with the collection of the fees generated by the sale of such memberships 
prior to march   the company had incurred much higher commissions approximately during the first year of the membership with substantially lower commissions approximately in all subsequent years 
the level commission structure results in the company incurring commissions at the rate of approximately per year for all membership years 
prior to january the company advanced commissions at the time of sale of all new memberships 
in january  the company implemented a policy whereby the associate receives only earned commissions on the first three sales unless the associate has successfully completed the new training program that was implemented at the same time 
for all sales beginning with the fourth membership or all sales made by an associate successfully completing the new training program  the company currently advances commissions at the time of sale of a new membership 
the amount of cash potentially advanced upon the sale of a new membership  prior to the recoupment of any charge backs described below  represents an amount equal to up to three years commission earnings 
although the average number of marketing associates receiving an advance commission payment on a new membership is  the overall initial advance may be paid to more than twenty different individuals  each at a different level within the overall commission structure 
this commission advance immediately increases an associate s account with the company and represents prepaid commissions on active memberships 
should a membership lapse before the advances have been recovered for each commission level  the company immediately generates an immediate charge back to the applicable sales associate to recapture of any unearned advance 
this charge back is deducted from any future advances that would otherwise be payable to the associate for additional new memberships 
the company historically has been able to immediately recover the majority of such charge backs 
any remaining unrecovered advance on a membership that has lapsed represents a receivable from the associate and is reflected as commission advances and is categorized as current or non current based on the expected recovery period 
additionally  even though a commission advance may have been fully recovered on a particular membership  no additional commission earnings from any membership will be paid to an associate until all previous advances on all memberships  both active and lapsed  have been recovered 
during  of all associates submitting new memberships accounted for of all such new memberships produced thereby further enhancing the recovery of commission advances 
the company s commission advance policy exposes the company to the risk of uncollectible commission advances  particularly for associates who do not receive commissions on a large number of memberships or who experience below average membership persistency 
the company closely monitors such commission advances to ensure maximum recoverability and maintains a recoverability reserve which at december  and  was million and million  respectively 
associates also receive compensation when associates sponsored by them or other associates that they have sponsored in their organization successfully complete the new training program implemented by the company in january in order to successfully qualify  the new associate going through the training program must produce three new memberships and recruit three new associates or personally sell five new memberships within days of becoming an associate 
prior to february  tpn distributors received commissions from the sale of personal and home care products  personal development products  communication services and satellite subscription sales 
these commissions were paid to the distributor actually making the sale as well as other distributors in his organization 
commissions on goods and services were not advanced and have averaged approximately of the product sales price 
these commissions were paid at the time of sale and subject to recovery only in the event of returned goods or refunds 
membership persistency one of the major factors affecting the company s profitability and cash flow is membership persistency  which represents the ability of the company to retain a membership  and therefore receive fees  once it has been written 
the company monitors its overall membership persistency rate  as well as the persistency rates with respect to memberships sold by individual associates and agents and persistency rates with respect to membership sales by geographic region and payment method 
the company s membership persistency rate measures the number of memberships in force at the end of a year as a percentage of the total of i memberships in force at the beginning of such year  plus ii new memberships sold during such year 
from through the year ended december   the company s annual membership persistency rates  using the foregoing method  have averaged approximately 
the annual membership persistency rates were  and for  and  respectively 
the company s overall membership persistency rate varies based on  among other factors  the relative age of total memberships in force 
the company s overall membership persistency rate could become lower when the memberships in force include a higher proportion of newer memberships 
during the last three years  the company has experienced significant increases in new membership sales and  as a result  the percentage of newer memberships in its total memberships in force has increased 
unless offset by other factors  this increase could result in a decline in the company s overall membership persistency rate as determined by the formula described above  but does not necessarily indicate that the new memberships written are less persistent  only that the ratio of new memberships to total memberships is higher than it averaged during the through period 
the company s financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if the persistency rates of existing and new memberships become materially lower than the company s historical experience 
operating ratios three principal operating measures monitored by the company in addition to membership persistency are the loss ratio  product cost ratio and the expense ratio 
the loss ratio represents membership benefit costs as a percentage of membership fees 
the product cost ratio represents product costs as a percentage of product sales 
the expense ratio represents the total of commissions  general and administrative expenses and premium taxes as a percentage of membership fees and product sales 
the company strives to maintain these ratios as low as possible 
these ratios do not measure total profitability because they do not take into account all revenues and expenses 
cash flow considerations relating to sales of memberships the company generally advances significant commissions at the time a membership is sold 
since approximately of membership fees are collected on a monthly basis  a significant cash flow deficit is created at the time a membership is sold 
this deficit is reduced as monthly membership fees are remitted and no additional commissions are paid on the membership until all previous commission advances have been fully recovered 
since the cash advanced at the time of sale of a new membership may be recovered over a multi year period  cash flow from operations may be adversely affected depending on the number of new memberships written in relation to the existing active base of memberships and the composition of new or existing sales associates producing such memberships 
income tax matters net operating losses at december   the company has utilized its net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal regular tax purposes 
the company has general business and rehabilitation tax credit carryforwards of approximately  expiring primarily in to  and an alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward of  that does not expire 
the company generated taxable income for the year ended december  and utilized nols originally generated in and in their entirety 
additionally  the company has nols in the amount of million representing the remaining nols of tpn as of the october acquisition date 
a valuation allowance has been established for these nols and the general business and rehabilitation tax credits as the company does not believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of these carryforwards and credits will be realized prior to expiration due in part to utilization restrictions imposed by section as discussed below 
the ability of the company to utilize nols and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future federal income taxes of the company is subject to various limitations under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
one such limitation is contained in section of the code which imposes an annual limitation on the amount of a corporation s taxable income that can be offset by those carryforwards in the event of a substantial change in ownership as defined in section ownership change 
in general  an ownership change occurs if during a specified three year period there are capital stock transactions that result in an aggregate change of more than in the beneficial ownership of the stock of the company 
however  the company does not have control over all possible variables which can affect the ownership change calculation and  accordingly  it is possible that an ownership change could occur in the future 
the effect of any such ownership change on the company s financial condition or results of operations cannot be determined because it is dependent upon unknown future facts and circumstances at the time of any such change  including  among others  the amount of any company s nols  the fair market value of the company s stock and the company s other tax attributes 
the acquisition of tpn by the company constituted an ownership change of tpn 
as a result  the ability of the company to utilize tpn s million in nols is limited to approximately  per year 
although the company did not utilize any of the tpn nol during  it did fully utilize the available amount during however  due to anticipated continuing growth and the expected availability of other tax benefits  the company does not believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the tpn nol carryforward will be realized 
the tpn nol expires in years through associate services the company derives revenues from services provided to its marketing sales force  principally from a one time enrollment fee of approximately from each new sales associate and the sale of marketing supplies and promotional materials to associates on an ongoing basis 
in january  the company implemented a training program fast start that allows an associate who successfully completes the program to advance through the various commission levels at a faster rate 
associates participating in this program pay a one time fee of instead of the fee 
the increased fee covers the additional training and materials used in the training program 
the company enrolled  new sales associates during compared to  during and  during  resulting in significant increases in associate services revenues and costs 
the company s direct costs of providing materials and services to associates are reflected as costs of associate services and direct marketing 
amounts collected from sales associates are intended primarily to offset the company s direct and indirect costs incurred in recruiting  monitoring and providing materials to sales associates and are not intended to generate material profits from such activities 
tpn s revenues were primarily comprised of receipts for goods and services provided by tpn to its distributors and other customers 
distributors were required to purchase a distributor kit that included training materials and business support literature 
tpn distributors were required to meet certain sales production levels to be eligible to receive commissions and many distributors elected to purchase products through an automatic monthly bank or credit card draft 
these practices  which resulted in enhanced product sales  were discontinued in february insurance operations ufl retained its existing life insurance business as a part of the company s acquisition of ufl 
the life insurance operations of ufl generated approximately million in life insurance premiums and has continued to provide claims processing for the coinsured medicare supplement and health care policies and receive full cost reimbursement for such services from the coinsurer 
ufl markets primarily to individuals  age and over  in new mexico  oklahoma and texas 
investment policy the company s investment policy is to some degree controlled by certain insurance regulations  which  coupled with management s own investment philosophy  results in a conservative investment portfolio that is not risk oriented 
the company s investments consist of common stocks  investment grade rated baa or higher preferred stocks and investment grade bonds primarily issued by corporations  the united states treasury  federal agencies  federally sponsored agencies and enterprises as well as mortgage backed securities and state and municipal tax exempt bonds 
the company is required to pledge investments to various state insurance departments as a condition to obtaining authority to do business in certain states 
disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheets include a certain amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risk 
due to the company s significant investment in fixed maturity investments  interest rate risk represents the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
as of december   substantially all of the company s investments were in investment grade rated baa or higher fixed maturity investments and interest bearing money market accounts 
the company does not hold any investments classified as trading account assets or derivative financial instruments 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly  with no effect given to any steps that management might take to counteract that change 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates reflect what could be deemed best and worst case scenarios 
the fair values shown in the following table are based on contractual maturities 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from those reflected in the following table estimated after hypothetical fair value at in interest rate change in december bp basis points interest rate dollars in thousands fixed maturity investments at december   bp increase  bp increase  bp decrease  bp decrease  fixed maturity investments at december   bp increase  bp increase  bp decrease  bp decrease  excluding short term investments with a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the table above illustrates  for example  that an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates at december  would reduce the estimated fair value of the company s fixed maturity investments by approximately million at that date 
at december   and based on the fair value of fixed maturity investments of million  an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates would have reduced the estimated fair value of the company s fixed maturity investments by approximately million at that date 
the company s increased sensitivity to rising interest rates is due to an overall increase in interest rates at december  as compared to december  and the additional investments with maturities over ten years 
the definitive extent of the interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable due to the variability of future interest rates  but the company does not believe such risk is material 
the company primarily manages its exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing investments that can be readily liquidated should the interest rate environment begin to significantly change 
year issues the company did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in its operating or business systems when the date changed from to based on operations since january   the company does not expect any significant impact to its ongoing business as a result of the year issue 
however  it is possible that the full impact of the date change  which was of concern due to computer programs that use two digits instead of four digits to define years  has not been fully recognized 
for example  it is possible that year or similar issues may occur with billing  payroll  financial closings at month end  quarterly  or year end 
the company believes that any such problems are likely to be minor and correctable 
in addition  the company could still be negatively affected if its customers or suppliers are adversely affected by the year or similar issues 
the company currently is not aware of any significant year or similar problems that have arisen for its customers and suppliers 
testing and conversion of system applications commenced during and was completed during testing of the company s information technology systems as modified for year issues with system dates set beyond january  successfully occurred in february the company was also exposed to the risk that one or more of its vendors or service providers could experience year problems that impact the ability of such vendor or service provider to provide goods and services 
though this was not considered as significant a risk with respect to the suppliers of goods  due to the availability of alternative suppliers  the disruption of certain services  such as utilities  could  depending upon the extent of the disruption  have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
further  the company must rely on other entities such as the federal reserve and its member banks whose year readiness efforts it does not control 
the company relies on such entities for the timely processing of its monthly automated clearing house transactions and credit card transactions 
the company has initiated a comprehensive program to assess the year compliance of its key vendors and service providers in order to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to such third parties that fail to remedy their own year issues 
in this regard  the company initiated formal communications with its significant vendors and financial institutions to assess their year readiness 
no material costs related to year compliance efforts by the company regarding such third parties have been incurred to date 
these efforts did not reveal any vendor or service provider year issue that the company believed would have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
costs incurred through the end of have not been material and were expensed as incurred 
any additional year costs will continue to be funded out of cash flow from operations 
the vast majority of the company s year remediation plan has been accomplished by the company s internal programming staff and costs were not incremental costs to the corporation  but rather represented the redeployment of existing information technology resources 
although concentration on year compliance has delayed other programming projects  such delays have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
accounting standard to be adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas was issued in june this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires the company recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative that is  gains and losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

while the number of new associates increased during  the number of new memberships sold  at least partially as a result of the fast start program  increased even more significantly 
future revenues from associate services will depend primarily on the number of new associates enrolled and the number who choose to participate in the company s training program  but the company expects that such revenues will continue to be largely offset by the direct and indirect cost to the company of training including training bonuses paid  providing associate services and other direct marketing expenses
