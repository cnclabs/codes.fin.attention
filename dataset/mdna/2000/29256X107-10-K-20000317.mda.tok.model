item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
since our inception in  we have primarily devoted our resources to funding drug discovery research and development 
we have been unprofitable to date and expect to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years as we invest in product research and development  preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory compliance 
we have sustained net losses of approximately million from the date of our inception to december  we have primarily financed our operations to date through private placements of common stock  which raised an aggregate of million in net proceeds  our initial public offering  which raised an aggregate of million in net proceeds including the over allotment sold in january  a private placement of preferred stock on march   which raised approximately million in net proceeds  and a subsequent public offering  which closed during october and raised approximately million in net proceeds 
on july   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of immunopharmaceutics in exchange for  shares of our common stock  and later issued an additional  shares of our common stock upon satisfaction of certain research milestones 
immunopharmaceutics financial results have been included in our financial statements since august  in march  immunopharmaceutics remaining operations in california were consolidated into our houston operations 
during october  we signed a research and common stock purchase agreement with lg chemical 
lg chemical purchased  shares of our common stock for million and committed to pay us up to million over a five year period to develop two compounds in clinical development 
of this amount  million has been paid of which million was receivable at december  
furthermore  million will be paid on june and december   and million will be paid on june and december  in august  we entered into an agreement with smithkline whereby we granted smithkline the exclusive right to work with us in the development and commercialization of novastan r in the us and canada for specified indications 
upon execution of the agreement  smithkline paid an million license fee  a million milestone payment in october and has also committed to pay up to a total of million in additional milestone payments based on the clinical development and fda approval of novastan r for the indications of hit and acute myocardial infarction 
future milestone payments for the acute myocardial infarction indication are subject to smithkline s agreement to market novastan r for the acute myocardial infarction indication 
at this time  smithkline has no plans to conduct development work for the acute myocardial infarction and stroke indications 
we are evaluating the feasibility of developing novastan r for ischemic stroke and possibly other indications 
in connection with the agreement  smithkline purchased  shares of our common stock for million and an additional  shares of our common stock for million in conjunction with our public offering  which closed during october our operating results have fluctuated significantly during each quarter  and we anticipate that such fluctuations  which are largely attributable to varying research and development commitments and expenditures  will continue for the next several years 
results of operations revenues were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
for the years  and  revenues included million  million and million from research agreements  commercialization agreements and collaborations with various other companies 
revenues from research agreements in and include research payments from lg chemical 
in revenues include research payments from lg chemical and a license fee of million and a milestone payment of million from smithkline 
interest income was million  million and million  for the years  and  respectively 
interest income for the year was significantly higher over and due to investment of funds received in conjunction with the agreement with smithkline and a secondary public offering of common stock completed in october research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in and decreased from million in to million in the decrease from to was due primarily to the completion of certain phase ii clinical trials related to sitaxsentan tbc and the selectin antagonist programs net of expenses incurred during for the nda submission for novastan r 
the decrease from to was due primarily to reduced spending on clinical trials for novastan r that were completed in and one time charges during associated with the license of novastan r 
non cash charges for the purchase of in process research and development decreased from million in to  in because of common stock issued pursuant to the novastan r license agreement and for stock issued under a research collaboration agreement signed in  respectively 
during  if a final approval is granted by the fda for novastan r  we will issue  shares of common stock to genentech  the prior licensee of novastan r 
upon approval  the value of the stock will be charged to expense over future periods based on the remaining patent life of novastan r 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in and decreased from million in to million in the increase in over was due primarily to approximately  accrued for settlement of a lawsuit  increased patent legal fees and increased consulting fees related to novastan r incurred in the decrease in from was primarily because of a million non cash charge related to the extension of the exercise period for certain stock options and higher patent legal fees in rent and related building services  which are a component of both research and development and general and administrative expenses  were approximately million in  and there was an increase of approximately  in from due primarily to an increase in leased space during we incurred net losses applicable to common shares of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our research and development activities to date principally through private placements of our common and preferred stock  our initial public offering and subsequent offerings of our common stock  issuances of common stock in conjunction with acquisitions  research and collaboration agreements and upon exercises of stock options and warrants  milestone and research payments received in conjunction with research and collaborative agreements  and investment income  net of interest expense 
at december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments of million 
we expect to incur substantial research and development expenditures as we design and develop biopharmaceutical products for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and other diseases 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase during and subsequent years because we will incur significant clinical trial costs for sitaxsentan and tbc compounds and expect to begin to incur costs for clinical trials related to additional compounds 
these costs include hiring personnel to direct and carry out all operations related to clinical trials  hospital and procedural costs  services of a contract research organization  and purchasing and formulating large quantities of the compound to be used in such trials 
there will be additional costs in future periods related to novastan r in complying with ongoing fda requirements and possible clinical trial expenditures for additional therapeutic indications 
furthermore  we anticipate that the administrative costs associated with our efforts will be significant 
the amount and timing of expenditures will depend  among other things  on our progress in ongoing research  clinical development and commercialization efforts 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources and our other revenue sources  should be sufficient to fund our cash requirements through the end of without considering the impact of revenues from novastan r 
this date is contingent upon various factors  including the rates of patient enrollment and spending associated with clinical trials for sitaxsentan and tbc and the level of research and development expenditures for our other compounds 
we cannot assure you that there will be market acceptance and commercial success of novastan r  which could significantly impact our cash flow 
we anticipate that we may need to raise substantial funds for future operations  which may be raised through collaborative arrangements  public or private issuance of debt and equity  or other arrangements 
we expect that additional expenditures will be required if additional product candidates enter clinical trials  which may require additional expenditures for laboratory space  scientific and administrative personnel  and services of contract research organizations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such additional financings on acceptable terms or in time to fund any necessary or desirable expenditures 
in the event such financings are not obtained  our drug discovery or development programs may be delayed  scaled back or eliminated  or we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require that we relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that would not otherwise be relinquished 
our ability to raise additional funding is contingent upon a number of factors which include the market acceptance and commercial success of novastan r  the ongoing cost of research and development activities  the attainment of research and clinical goals of product candidates  the timely approval of our product candidates by appropriate governmental and regulatory agencies  the presence and effect of competitive products  our ability to manufacture and market products commercially  the retention of key personnel  and conditions in the capital markets 
impact of inflation and changing prices the pharmaceutical research industry is labor intensive  and wages and related expenses increase in inflationary periods 
the lease of space and related building services for the houston facility contains a clause that escalates rent and related services each year based on the increase in building operating costs and the increase in the houston consumer price index  respectively 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
year the year  or yk  problem has not caused any material disruptions to our facilities or operations and has not resulted in any material costs 
we have developed reasonable contingency plans to avoid  to the extent practicable  year related problems that may yet occur due to hidden defects in computer hardware or software 
we anticipate  but cannot guarantee  that the year problem will not create material disruptions to our facilities or operations and will not cause us to incur material costs
