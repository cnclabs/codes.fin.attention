as of december   the company has shipped over of its mixing consoles worldwide 
the price of the company s mixing consoles generally ranges from  to million  and is often the most expensive piece of equipment in the studio 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and prior to shipping the product  generally requires a substantial deposit anywhere from  up to of the console s value and a firm purchase order 
from time to time and depending on the financial condition of the customer  the company may require payment of a substantial portion of the purchase price  an irrevocable letter of credit  or a purchase order from a third party lessor 
the company usually relies on new orders in the same quarter to achieve its net revenues 
the company generally recognized revenue upon shipment 
in december  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
the sec staff addresses several issues in sab no 
 including the timing for recognizing revenue derived from selling arrangements that involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product occurs after shipment and transfer of title 
the company s existing revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue at the time the customer takes title to the product  generally at the time of shipment  because the company has routinely met its installation obligations and obtained customer acceptance 
applying the requirements of sab no 
to the present selling arrangements used by the company for the sale of equipment may require a change in the company s accounting policy for revenue recognition and the deferral of the recognition of revenue from such equipment sales until installation is complete and accepted by the customer 
the effect of such a change  if any  must be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting no later than the company s second quarter of its fiscal year ending on december  at the current time it is not possible to determine the effect this change will have on the results of operations of the company

the decline in asian sales in is due to a weakness in the asian economy 
the decline in european sales in was the direct result of employee turnover within the international sales department and the loss of sales representatives  which limited the company s ability to maintain existing market share and penetrate new markets abroad

the decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in is due to a decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve due to the collection of previously reserved for balances and a reduction in payroll expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in is due to increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve to cover inherent risk of carrying higher receivable balances and selling to new customers

interest expense for included a charge of  related to the beneficial conversion feature associated with the convertible promissory note issued in july provision benefit for income taxes the deferred tax assets valuation allowance at december  and is attributable to federal and state deferred tax assets 
management believes that sufficient uncertainty exists with regard to the realizability of these tax assets such that a full valuation allowance is necessary 
these factors include the lack of a significant history of consistent profits and the lack of carryback capacity to realize these assets 
based on this absence of objec tive evidence  management is unable to assert that it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the company s net deferred tax assets

year risks we have addressed computer networks year compliance in our systems  accounting software  computer hardware and existing products  and have communicated with our significant third party vendors with respect to their respective states of readiness 
in order to assess year compliance of our products and systems  we identified those systems critical to our operations and the operations of our technologies and  based upon tests to such products and systems  believed that all of our systems and technologies  to the extent developed  were materially compliant 
we expended approximately  to assess and address the year problem 
although it is now past january   we cannot assure you that we or our suppliers and customers have not been affected in a manner that is not yet apparent 
in addition  some computer programs that were date sensitive to the year may not have been programmed to process the year as a leap year  and any negative consequential effects remain unknown 
as a result  we will continue to monitor our year compliance and the year compliance of our suppliers and customers 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to materially impact the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop  on march  sop provides guidelines for accounting for costs of computer software developed for internal use 
sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sop is not expected to materially impact the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow factors affecting future operating results historically  the company has derived virtually all of its revenues from sales of its digitally controlled audio mixing console system  which system is based upon its hardware platform 
the company believes that sales of this system  along with enhancements thereof  and the r recorder and new system digital console will continue to constitute a significant portion of the company s revenues 
it is expected for the foreseeable future that a greater portion of the company s revenue will come from the new system digital console 
accordingly  any factor adversely affecting the company s base system  whether technical  competitive or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company has expended and will continue to expend substantial funds to launch its new system digital console in the first quarter of fiscal the company s ability to fund operations through december  is dependent upon achievement of its operating plan 
if the company did not attain its operating plan it would obtain additional financing or cut expenses 
the company believes that additional debt or equity financing will be available from existing investors and others 
however  there can be no assurance as to the terms and conditions of any such financing and no certainty that funds would be available when needed 
the inability to obtain additional financing  if needed  would be likely to have a material adverse effect on the company 
to the extent that any future financing involves the sale of the company s equity securities  the company s then existing shareholders could be substantially diluted 
a limited number of the company s system sales typically account for a substantial percentage of the company s quarterly revenue because of the relatively high average sales price of such systems 
moreover  the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations of future revenue 
therefore  if revenue is below expectations  the company s operating results are likely to be adversely affected 
in addition  the timing of revenue is influenced by a number of other factors  including the timing of individual orders and shipments  industry trade shows  seasonal customer buying patterns  changes in product development and sales and marketing expenditures  custom financing arrangements  production limitations and international sales activity 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  variations in the timing of recognition of revenue could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter and may result in unanticipated quarterly earnings shortfalls or losses 
the markets for the company s system are characterized by changing technologies and new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its continued ability to enhance its base system with features including new software and hardware add ons and to develop or acquire and introduce new products and features which meet new market demands and changing customer requirements on a timely basis 
the company is currently designing and developing new products  primarily in the areas of recording  editing and mixing functions of sound production as well as digital audio processing and networking systems 
in addition  there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
see business 
historically  the company s primary market success has been in the music segment of the professional audio market 
in order for the company to grow  the company believes that it must continue to gain market share in the music market segment  as well as in its other targeted markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete favorably in all markets 
segments 
the company s inability to compete favorably could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the markets for the company s products are intensely competitive and characterized by significant price competition 
the company believes that its ability to compete depends on elements both within and outside its control  including the success and timing of new product development and introduction by the company and its competitors  product performance and price  distribution  availability of lease or other financing alternatives  resale of used systems and customer support 
see business competition 
currently  the company uses many sole or limited source suppliers  certain of which are critical to the integrated circuits included in the company s base system 
major delays or terminations in supplies of such components could have a significant adverse effect on the company s timely shipment of its products  which in turn would adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
the company also relies on single vendors to manufacture major subassemblies for its products 
any extended interruption in the future supply or increase in the cost of subassemblies manufactured by its primary or other third party vendors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see business manufacturing and suppliers 
in addition  as different electrical  radiation or other standards applicable to the company s products are adopted in countries  including the united states  or groups of countries in which the company sells its products  the failure of the company to modify its products  if necessary  to comply with such standards would likely have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see business sales and distribution 
the company generally relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright law and trademark law  contracts and technical measures to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products and technologies 
however  the company believes that such measures provide only limited protection of its proprietary information  and there is no assurance that such measures will be adequate to prevent misappropriation 
in addition  significant and protracted litigation may be necessary to protect the company s intellectual property rights  to determine the scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement 
there can be no assurance that third party claims alleging infringement will not be asserted against the company in the future 
any such claims could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see business proprietary rights 
the company s success depends  in part  on its ability to retain key management and technical employees and its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
in addition  the company s ability to manage any growth will require it to continue to improve and expand its management  operational and financial systems and controls 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  its business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
as a result of these and other factors  the company has experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipates that these fluctuations will continue in future periods 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining or improving its profitability or avoiding losses in any future period 
further  it is likely that in some future period the company s net revenues or operating results will be below the expectations of public market securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected

the company does not invest for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s primary objective with its investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
in accordance with the company s investment policy  the company places investments with high credit quality institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
interest income for the year ended december  was approximately  a decrease in interest rates could result in lower interest income earned from its money market and other cash deposit investments 
however  based on the investment portfolio contents  the company believes that if a significant change in interest rates were to occur  it would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows  although there can be no assurance of this 
sales through the company s japanese subsidiary are denominated in japanese yen 
the company s receivables denominated in yen are subject to foreign exchange risk 
the company does not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate the foreign currency risk with respect to such arrangements 
an adverse change in the foreign exchange rate would have an effect on the price the company ultimately sells its consoles for in japan and could result in foreign currency transaction losses 
an adverse change of in the yen exchange rate would result in a decline in income before taxes of approximately
