item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition markets and marketing strategy markets we market our eas products and systems principally to retailers 
many retailers have made the use of eas systems a standard operating practice because these products and systems have proven to be a cost effective method of reducing inventory shrinkage 
inventory shrinkage is often the second largest variable operating expense of retailers  after payroll costs  and normally ranges from to of sales 
eas products and systems help improve a retailer s profitability not only by reducing inventory shrinkage  but also by allowing the use of open merchandising which increases product accessibility to customers 
eas products and systems were first used by soft goods retailers to protect clothing 
due to technological advances  applications for hard goods merchandise non apparel merchandise have become economical and effective 
hard goods and food retailers  such as supermarkets  hypermarkets  home improvement centers  drug  mass merchandise  optical  music  hardware  book  video  and entertainment stores have increasingly become users of eas products and systems 
we believe that we hold a significant market share of this worldwide eas market 
retailers also make extensive use of video systems to enhance security and the safety of their operations  and also utilize access control systems 
in addition to retail applications  our ultra max technology and several of our other eas technologies are used in non retail applications to protect assets such as personal computers  facsimile and copy machines  telephones  artwork  limited access files and portable laboratory equipment and tools from loss by unauthorized removal 
non retail installations of our video  access control and or asset management products and systems range from small to medium size businesses to large domestic and international operations and businesses 
we sell our products into these industry segments primarily through an indirect global network of dealers and distributors 
we engage in various direct advertising and marketing activities to stimulate demand for our products and partners with the dealers and distributors to fulfill the needs of end user customers 
we have been selected as the security provider of choice by many of the world s leading trade organizations  retailers  manufacturers and corporations  as well as by major event committees such as those responsible for the expo world s fair in hanover  germany 
the company is also the official electronic security sponsor and supplier of the olympic winter games in salt lake city  utah  and official electronic security supplier of the us olympic team throughout we are continuing to add to our broad range of electronic security products and systems to offer our outstanding customer base of of the top retailers in the world  as well as more than half of the global fortune companies an unmatched selection of integrated security solutions to traditional security problems in a wide range of industries 
at the same time  we are introducing advanced product applications and product suites for the extended security needs of modern businesses  with their complex  geographically distributed operations  facilities and supply chains  in order to meet our goal of securing today s business 
marketing strategies the company s principal marketing strategies are as follows recurring label sales the sale of eas systems and devices to hard goods retailers has been growing significantly in recent years and we believe that there is potential for continued growth 
hard goods merchandise is protected with labels  that can be deactivated at the point of sale and then leave the store with the merchandise  representing a source of recurring revenues 
labels may be self adhesive  stick on labels  which are attached to merchandise by the retailer or source tags applied at the point of manufacture or distribution 
source tagging we have formed relationships with manufacturers and packaging companies  as well as increasing numbers of our major retail customers around the world to apply eas labels during manufacturing or packaging processes 
virtually all retail segments  including discount  drug stores  hypermarkets  food  multi media  home improvement and automotive parts stores  are now covered by these programs 
source tagging helps retailers increase product sales and profitability through open merchandising and product exposure  reduced shrinkage  and reduced costs by eliminating the need for store personnel to apply security tags and labels to merchandise 
currently  thousands of vendors worldwide have participated in source tagging with the company s eas technologies 
the company estimates that in fiscal  these suppliers provided us and international retailers with more than billion source tagged items  which represent of total company eas label sales 
source tagging programs are expected to grow at a rapid pace in fiscal the increased utilization of source tagging is expected to result in increased label sales and or royalty income as well as increased sales of systems and deactivators 
licensing label production the company has entered into a license agreement with a leading label producing company to manufacture the company s ultra strip labels 
this licensing is intended to provide customers with multiple sources of eas labels and to increase the level of research and development resources directed to these technologies 
these programs are intended to result in a broader distribution of ultra strip labels and  therefore  facilitate the growth of ultra max technology 
royalty fees to be paid to the company based on sales generated by the licensees will provide recurring revenue to the company 
product choice while our proprietary ultra max technology is our most advanced eas technology  offering an unmatched combination of wide exit coverage  high pick rate versatility and virtually no false alarms  we recognize other technologies may be preferred by some customers 
accordingly  we offer a broad range of eas technologies in order to comply with the customer s specific needs 
providing extended security technologies under the sensormatic brand our ultimate objective is to build on our strong base of traditional electronic security products to offer a fully integrated suite of products and knowledge based technologies extended security technologies 
these products and technologies  which will be consolidated and marketed under the sensormatic brand name  will be designed to meet the expanded security and operational needs of today s businesses 
sales and service organization at june   the company employed approximately  sales and customer engineering personnel worldwide to market and service its products directly to retail and non retail customers 
in addition  the company s products are marketed and serviced by a large network of sales and customer engineering personnel employed by dealers and distributors throughout the world 
sales and service personnel are directed from offices located throughout the us and in numerous countries worldwide 
the company believes that a major factor in its success has been the high quality of its extensive and experienced sales and service organization 
the company presently markets its products directly in more than countries throughout north america  europe and certain asia pacific and latin american countries  and sells its products to dealers and distributors in more than other countries 
the company will continue to explore expanding into additional countries in the middle east  latin america  asia  africa and eastern europe using similar distribution arrangements 
the company has organized its sales force into specialized sales groups to market its systems to specific customer groups 
for example  in addition to its sales and marketing personnel dedicated to the source tagging division  retail specialized sales groups have been created to target the supermarket industry and key soft goods retailers in the us similar specialized sales groups  concentrating on self service stores and hypermarkets  have been formed in europe 
the company will continue to specialize its sales force and believes such specialization will accelerate its success in marketing to targeted user groups and provide improved customer service 
the company has an indirect sales force dedicated to supporting its dealers and distributors in promoting the company s products and engages in international marketing 
the company has organized its customer service engineering force into a separate global services division  to provide the delivery and installation of quality products and services worldwide 
backlog as of june  and june   the company had a backlog of orders of million and million  respectively 
backlog includes only expected revenues from firm orders  which are expected to be installed or delivered within one year 
backlog at any time is not necessarily indicative of the level of business to be expected in the ensuing period 
seasonal aspect of the business although our business is not necessarily seasonal  it has been our experience  with respect to worldwide retail customers  that new orders and installations generally decrease during the december through february period 
we believe this is attributable to the focus by retail store management on the holiday selling season and year end inventory analysis during this period 
additionally  the traditional european vacation period during the months of july and august results in a general decline of new orders and installations during this period 
patents and related rights as of june   the company owned or was the exclusive licensee of active patents issued by the us patent and trademark office as well as corresponding foreign patents 
these patents cover a variety of inventions and features  including the company s acousto magnetic ultra max  electromagnetic  microwave  swept rf systems and video systems and components 
the company had patent applications pending in the us  and corresponding patent applications pending in various foreign countries  for various other inventions relating to its products 
there can be no assurance that any patents will be issued to the company on any of its pending applications 
the company is also a non exclusive licensee under certain patents issued in the us and various foreign countries relating to the manufacture  use and sale of certain labels for use with its electromagnetic systems 
the company does not make any representation as to the scope  validity or value of any patents which have been or may be issued or licensed to it or as to the possible infringement by its products on patents owned by others 
although the company s patent program is important  the company believes that because of its technical knowledge and experience  the abilities of its established and experienced sales and service organization and its leadership position in the industry  it is not dependent upon patent protection to maintain its leadership in the electronic security industry 
supply chain operations the company s major production facilities are located in puerto rico  florida and ireland 
the company also has a manufacturing facility in brazil and does limited final assembly and testing at its san diego facility 
the puerto rico facility is the company s largest and accounts for two thirds of the company s manufacturing personnel 
the boca raton  florida facility specializes in eas label production 
the operation in cork  ireland allows the company to manufacture a wide range of products closer to its large european customer base 
fabrication of many access control products is sub contracted to local manufacturing facilities near the access control division located in massachusetts  while most hard tag production is sub contracted to low cost  high quality suppliers in mexico and china 
the company s strategy is to maintain critical manufacturing processes in house and to form alliances with independent manufacturing partners to produce its products at the lowest possible cost 
this in house capability  combined with such alliances  provides control over costs and quality  while increasing responsiveness to the demands of the market which results in a distinct competitive advantage 
independent suppliers provide various component products and materials used to manufacture the company s products  and also manufacture certain component parts and label products to the company s specifications 
a core supplier base of approximately major suppliers  representing of purchasing dollars  has been established worldwide to maintain a generally reliable flow of quality materials at the lowest possible cost 
certain magnetic materials used in the manufacture of ultra max labels and tags are currently purchased from one supplier 
while there are potential alternatives to the supply of such material by that supplier  the loss or disruption of this source of supply could result in increased costs or product shortages or otherwise materially adversely affect the company s business 
the company has been pursuing development of alternative materials for use in the company s ultra max labels and additional sources of supply 
the company has improved  and expects to continue to improve  its production efficiencies and cost structures through new processes  increased automation and improved product designs 
such improvements  particularly to increase capacity and lower product costs of eas products  have required additional capital investment for new production equipment 
the company s consolidation program for its warehousing and distribution locations  which commenced during fiscal year  was substantially completed during fiscal this program leverages the use of third party logistics service providers  enabling the company to capitalize on best in class logistics services and resources 
the number of warehouse locations was significantly reduced 
competition the electronic security industry continues to be highly competitive 
there are many alternatives available to protect people and assets  in addition to the use of eas  video  and access control systems 
these alternatives include guards and private detective services  mirrors  burglar alarms and other magnetic and electronic devices  and services combining some or all of the above elements 
a number of other companies market eas equipment to retail stores directly or through distributors  including sentry technology corporation in the us  checkpoint systems  inc including its recent acquisition of meto ae in the us  europe  latin america and asia and nedap us in europe  all of which are principal competitors of the company 
with respect to video system components  there are numerous companies  including philips  panasonic  pelco and vicon  that market directly or through distributors such equipment to both retail and non retail customers 
there are many competing companies in the sale of access control systems  as well  including cardkey inc  westinghouse electronic corporation  northern computers inc and casi rusco inc 
sensormatic competes in marketing its systems and products principally on the basis of product performance multiple technologies integrated security solutions service price price competition has been intense in recent years and could adversely affect our business 
in addition  either of the following could adversely affect our business 
other firms with greater financial and other resources could enter into direct competition  or expand the scope of their existing competition  with us 
new technologies could be developed and introduced into the marketplace 
sales revenue direct sales and sales type leases the company s sales revenues are predominantly generated by direct sales and sales type leases of new products and systems 
additionally  the company generates sales revenues by export sales of new products and systems to distributors in foreign countries and through the sale of selected new equipment to dealers and system integrators 
the company sells its systems on a current  deferred or installment payment basis 
substantially all deferred payment obligations are payable within one year 
installment contract obligations are payable monthly over terms generally up to five years 
installment contract obligations are subject to stated or imputed interest at prevailing market rates and are generally secured by the purchased equipment 
the company s sales type leases consist of non cancelable leases of new equipment  generally with terms of months or greater 
it is the company s policy to securitize sales type leases 
the company believes that offering its customers flexible terms  including long term financing  is an advantageous competitive marketing program 
for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended june   no single customer accounted for or more of the company s consolidated revenues 
rental and installation  maintenance and other revenues the company also leases systems under non cancelable operating leases 
such leases are generally for terms of to months 
additionally  the company generates revenues from the installation  service and maintenance of its systems 
working capital items we have historically maintained a high level of accounts receivable and sales type leases outstanding  measured as a percentage of revenues 
one reason for this is that a key element of our marketing strategy is to increase market penetration by providing alternative financing options to our retail customers 
these alternatives include deferred billing and long term installment sales and lease terms  and they result in extended accounts receivable recovery periods 
additionally  the company has experienced a historical pattern of delayed payments by certain retail customers 
as a result  our levels of receivables past due represent a relatively high percentage of total receivables 
this strategy has given us a competitive marketing program and has helped us penetrate markets and increase customer loyalty and commitment to sensormatic 
our ability to pursue such a strategy results from our relatively high gross profit margins and the financing programs we have put in place which allow us to sell our customer receivables and leases and thereby monetize the accounts receivable 
product research  development and engineering over the past decade  research  development and engineering expenses have trended upward 
the increase in these activities has resulted in the continued broadening of the systems and technology offered by the company  resulting in the expansion of the applications and customer base for the company s systems 
new product development and replacement of less effective products in all product categories continues to be a high priority for the company 
during fiscal  the company introduced more than new or enhanced eas products  while eliminating of its older product portfolio 
additionally  during fiscal  the company introduced more than new or enhanced video and access control products 
the company has strengthened its research  development and engineering activities by increasing its investment in sophisticated engineering equipment  expanding key consulting relationships throughout the world and substantially increasing its professional engineering staff  with particular emphasis on magnetic materials research  digital signal processing  digital storage video compression technology  rf data transmission and software development skills 
several of the company s eas systems depend on the use of magnetic materials and the company has liaisons with many key research centers throughout the world 
software is another major element in the company s new product designs and manufacturing processes 
in fiscal  and  the company incurred approximately million  million and million  respectively  for research  development and engineering costs 
the reduced level in fiscal when compared to was due to the company s efforts to outsource certain products resulting in a reduction in the associated research  development and engineering expenses 
during fiscal  the company expects spending for research  development and engineering to increase approximately 
governmental regulation the sale and use of our products are subject to regulation by a number of governmental authorities 
these include authorities with jurisdiction over the sale and use of electronic and communications equipment  as well as authorities in charge of health and safety standards 
our products comply with the governmental requirements and standards  which are currently applicable in the us and other countries where sensormatic markets products directly or through its subsidiaries 
our products also comply with standards in a number of other countries where our products are marketed through distributors 
emf emission electromagnetic field emf emissions from our eas systems are within the levels permitted by the current us governmental safety standards for this type of equipment 
while we cannot assure that more restrictive emf standards will not be adopted in the us  we believe that the emf levels generated by the eas systems that we market will remain within any new emf safety standards which may be established 
in europe  where we have a high level of business activity  we are participating actively in the development of evolving technical standards by cenelec european committee for electrotechnical standardization and etsi european telecommunications standards institute 
in order for us to apply the ce mark  which is required by the european union eu  our products must meet the standards established by cenelec  etsi and other standard setting organizations 
new standards were introduced in to apply the ce mark  and our products were certified to those standards 
in  the eu council of health ministers recommended new basic guidelines for exposure to emf emissions 
the guidelines state that standards for implementation must be developed by eu member states and or bodies such as cenelec 
these standards would relate to measurement methods  duration of exposure and other criteria  and would be subject to adoption  and possible modification  by individual countries 
we are actively working with cenelec to help develop such standards relating to eas and related products 
we expect that the products we market will comply with the standards that are developed to implement the basic guidelines  as and when such standards are adopted by the individual eu countries 
fda activities the us food and drug administration fda has been examining the effects of various devices  including eas systems  on implantable medical devices such as pacemakers 
the fda has issued a physician advisory letter and an industry guidance document recommending that patients with implantable medical devices avoid lingering near  or leaning on  eas systems 
fda staff members indicated  in connection with the release of such letter and  subsequently  that the fda does not view interactions with eas systems as representing a significant public health hazard and made reference to the large number of people passing through such systems each day in relation to the small number of reported incidents 
manufacturers of implantable medical devices  as well as sensormatic and the international electronic article surveillance manufacturers association of which sensormatic is a member  have long offered the same don t linger don t lean advice as was given by the fda 
an american heart association science advisory also agreed with the fda recommendations  as have statements issued by the european society of cardiology and the uk medical devices agency 
we are also aware of other studies of whether any hazards are posed to wearers of implantable medical devices by eas systems 
we believe that there is substantial evidence that no health hazard is posed by the interactions between our eas systems and such medical devices  including opinions expressed by leading physicians 
we have presented such evidence to the fda  and offer such evidence to persons conducting such studies 
however  we cannot assure that such studies will not result in the publication of adverse reports  the recommendation of precautionary measures and or the adoption of regulations  which could adversely affect the company 
we are also aware of prior attempts by one of our competitors to generate adverse publicity regarding this issue 
we cannot assure that such attempts will not adversely affect the company 
continuing review governmental bodies  as well as standard setting organizations such as cenelec  etsi and others  are continually considering the establishment of new standards and reconsidering existing standards relating to products and health and safety issues 
we cannot assure that adverse changes in applicable standards will not occur or that new and adverse standards will not be adopted 
similarly  we cannot assure that our products will meet all applicable regulations and standards in all countries where we wish to market our products

as a result  the company gained a strong foothold in the global food and drug store markets  while increasing its established presence in the music and do it yourself diy industries 
while the overall video systems product line revenues were flat in fiscal versus fiscal  sales of digital video systems increased  offset by decreases in multiplexer revenue driven by price competition 
the challenge being addressed in the video division is to enhance the product line to ensure that the needs of all potential customer segments are addressed

cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and cash used of million in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher revenues resulting in increases in customer receivables 
in fiscal  the company initiated a program to more carefully manage the timing of vendor payments resulting in a million reduction in accounts payable 
the company maintained this program throughout fiscal the company historically maintains a high level of receivables and sales type leases outstanding  measured as a percentage of revenues 
this results  in part  from a key element of the company s marketing strategy  which has been to provide alternative financing options to its retail customers  including deferred billing and long term installment sales and lease terms  resulting in extended accounts receivable recovery periods 
additionally  the company has experienced a historical pattern of delayed payments by certain retail customers and  accordingly  the company s levels of receivables past due represent a relatively high percentage of total receivables 
the company s strategy has helped it penetrate markets and increase customer loyalty and commitment to sensormatic 
the ability to pursue such a strategy results from the company s relatively high gross profit margins and the various accounts receivable securitization programs the company has put in place which allow the company to sell its customer receivables 
the terms of certain of the company s principal receivable securitization programs provide for over collateralization and  accordingly  the company does not receive the full balance of such receivables until the customer s receivables have been paid in full to financing institutions 
the company accounts for this over collateralization as a receivable due from financing institutions which is included in other current assets and the non current portion in patents and other assets 
the company aggressively pursues the sale and or securitization of all its long term customer receivables and a significant portion of its trade customer receivables 
the company believes the gross profit margin it receives on the sale of its products  combined with the interest income it receives on such receivables  are sufficient to cover the carrying cost of the long term customer receivables which it is unable to securitize and the over collateralization holdbacks

under these covenants  the company was unable to pay cash dividends in recent years and has limited ability to pay cash dividends at present

the company is currently addressing euro related issues and its impact on information systems  currency exchange rate risk  taxation  contracts  competition and pricing 
action plans currently being implemented are expected to result in compliance with all laws and regulations

the following factors  among other possible factors  could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated changes in international operations  exchange rate risk  market conditions for the company s products  the company s ability to provide innovative and cost effective solutions  development risks  changes in regulations or standards applicable to the company s products  competition and changes in the economic climate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
the company seeks to minimize the risks from these interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through its regular operating and financing activities and  when considered appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company s policy is to not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and is not a party to any leveraged financial instruments 
a discussion of the company s accounting policies for interest rate swap and foreign currency forward agreements is included in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company manages market risk by restricting the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities and by limiting potential interest and currency rate exposures to amounts that are not material to the company s consolidated results of operations and cash flows 
the company also has procedures to monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value of its long term debt  short term debt instruments and other financial instruments  considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency rates 
exposure to short term interest rates the company utilizes primarily fixed rate debt as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to further limit the company s exposure to short term interest rate movements relating to off balance sheet receivable financings 
at june  and  the company s fixed rate long term debt had a face value and carrying value of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of long term debt at june  and was million and million  respectively 
based upon a hypothetical point increase in the period end market interest rate across all long term debt maturities  the fair value of this liability would decrease by approximately million and million  respectively 
in order to manage the risk associated with the variance amount on the sale of certain receivables  including the uk financing program as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this report  the company enters into interest rate swap agreements  which have the effect of converting the floating discount rate to a fixed discount rate  thereby limiting the variance amount paid or received by the company 
the company had none of these interest rate swap agreements outstanding at june  the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements at june  was million 
the carrying value and fair value of the liability for these agreements were million and million  respectively  at june  based upon a hypothetical point increase in the period end market interest rate as of june   the fair value of this liability would have decreased by approximately million resulting in a receivable of million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreements 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
exposure to exchange rates as a result of the sales of its products in foreign markets  the company s offshore operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies 
its offshore operations are principally in europe  asia and latin america 
the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
therefore  increases and decreases in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are offset by changes in the fair value of net underlying foreign currency transaction exposures 
the company s principal currency exposures relate to the euro and the british pound against the us dollar 
the company s exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from intercompany loans utilized to finance foreign subsidiaries  receivables  payables and firm commitments arising from international transactions 
the company attempts to have all such transaction exposures hedged with internal natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and  once these opportunities have been exhausted  through derivative financial instruments with third parties primarily using forward contracts 
at june  and  the company had in place foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
the carrying value of these contracts was an asset of million at june  and million at june  the fair value of these contracts at june  was million and at was immaterial 
based upon a strengthening of the us dollar compared to these foreign currencies  the estimated fair value of the asset would increase for fiscal and by million and million  respectively 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above  changes in exchange rates also change the dollar value of the resulting sales and affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in levels of local currency prices or sales reported in us dollars 
the above discussion of the company s procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from the company s sensitivity analyses are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used by the company to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events or gains losses
