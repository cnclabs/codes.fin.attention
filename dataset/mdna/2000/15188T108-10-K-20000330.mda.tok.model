item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources general charter municipal mortgage acceptance company the company is a delaware business trust which is engaged in the acquisition and ownership either directly or indirectly of tax exempt participating and non participating first mortgage bonds fmbs issued by various state or local governments or other agencies or authorities and secured by participating and non participating mortgage loans on the underlying properties underlying properties 
as of december   the company owned a portfolio of fmbs and had net assets of approximately  the company was formed by the consolidation the consolidation  on october   of summit tax exempt bond fund  lp tax exempt i  summit tax exempt lp ii tax exempt ii and summit tax exempt lp iii tax exempt iii  three publicly registered limited partnerships the partnerships 
one of the general partners of the partnerships was an affiliate of related capital company related 
in order to generate increased tax exempt income and  as a result  enhance the value of the company s shares  the company intends to invest in or acquire additional tax exempt bonds secured by multifamily properties 
the company believes that it can earn above market rates of interest on its bond acquisitions by focusing its efforts primarily on affordable housing 
the manager estimates that nearly of all new multifamily development contains an affordable component which produces tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
the company has designed a direct purchase program specifically designed to appeal to developers of such properties 
in general  these properties are smaller than traditional multifamily housing properties  averaging units 
the traditional method of financing tax exempt properties requires the involvement of credit enhancement  rating agencies and investment bankers 
therefore  the up front cost of such financing is generally much higher than traditional multifamily financing 
through its direct purchase program  the company will invest in or acquire tax exempt bonds without the cost associated with credit enhancement  rating agencies and investment bankers 
the company believes that the up front cost savings to the developer will translate into a higher than market interest rate on the bonds acquired by the company 
the company believes that it is well positioned to market its direct purchase program as a result of the manager s affiliation with related 
the manager is a single purpose affiliate of related which is controlled by the same individuals and entities which own related 
the manager benefits from its affiliation with related because the manager is able to utilize related s resources and relationships in the multifamily affordable housing finance industry to source potential borrowers of first mortgage bonds the company could invest in or acquire 
related and its predecessor companies have specialized in offering debt and equity products to mid market multifamily owners and developers for over years 
related has provided debt and equity financing to properties valued at over billion 
according to the national multihousing council survey  related is the third largest owner of apartments in the united states 
the company does not operate as a mortgage reit  which generally utilize high levels of leverage and acquire subordinated interests in commercial and or residential mortgage backed securities 
rather  the company utilizes low levels of leverage and generally invests in or acquires long term  fixed rate  tax exempt fmbs 
as a result  the company did not experience the ill effects associated with the volatile interest rate environment during and pursuant to its trust agreement  the company is only able to incur leverage or other financing up to of the company s total market value as defined in the trust agreement as of the date incurred 
mortgage reits typically incur leverage at ratios ranging from between to due to the company s low level of leverage  the company has not been affected by the lack of liquidity that recently impaired mortgage reits and its portfolio does not contain assets that are especially vulnerable to volatility during periods of interest rate fluctuations 
in general  the fmbs that the company either invests in or acquires call for ten year restrictions from prepayments  eliminating the company s susceptibility to significant levels of repayment risk as a result of interest rate reductions 
consistent with the foregoing  the company focuses on providing investors with a stable level of distributions  even through unstable markets 
the company requires long term financing in order to invest in and hold its portfolio of fmbs 
to date  this long term liquidity has come from the company s private label tender option program  a preferred equity offering by a subsidiary  and secured borrowings under securitization transactions 
these financing sources have expected lives equal to the expected lives of the fmbs used to collateralize them  and are explained in more detail below 
on a short term basis  the company requires funds to pay its operating expenses and to make distributions to its shareholders 
the primary sources of the company s short term liquidity needs are the interest income from the fmbs and promissory notes in excess of the related financing costs  and interest income from cash and temporary investments 
during the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries decreased approximately  the decrease was primarily due to the purchase of fmbs  the purchase of other bond related investments  an increase in deferred bond selection costs  the net purchase of temporary investments  an increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents  loans made to properties  distributions paid to the manager and shareholders of the company and to preferred shareholders of subsidiary   an increase in deferred costs relating to the private label tender option program  and deferred costs relating to the issuance of preferred stock of subsidiary  which exceeded cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from repayments of fmbs  an increase in minority interest  proceeds from secured borrowings  and the issuance of preferred shares of subsidiary 
included in the adjustments to reconcile the net income to cash provided by operating activities is a loss on repayments of fmbs  a loss on impairment of assets  and net amortization 
the company has entered into forbearance agreements on several fmbs and may be required to extend these agreements or enter into new agreements in the future 
such agreements may adversely impact liquidity  however  interest payments from fmbs and rites are anticipated to provide sufficient liquidity to fund the company s operating expenditures  debt service and distributions in future years 
the determination as to whether it is in the best interest of the company to enter into forbearance agreements on the fmbs or  alternatively  to pursue its remedies under the loan documents  including foreclosure  is based upon several factors including  but not limited to  underlying property performance  owner cooperation and projected legal costs 
the difference between the stated interest rates and the rates paid by fmbs is not accrued as interest income for financial reporting purposes 
the accrual of interest at the stated interest rate will resume once an underlying property s ability to pay the stated rate has been adequately demonstrated 
interest income of approximately   and  was not recognized for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in january and february  distributions of   per preferred share and  
per share  respectively  which were declared in december  were paid to the preferred shareholders of subsidiary and shareholders of the company  respectively  from cash flow from operations for the quarter ended december  management is not aware of any trends or events  commitments or uncertainties  which have not otherwise been disclosed that will or are likely to impact liquidity in a material way

in addition  the owner trust obtained a municipal bond insurance policy from mbia to credit enhance certificate distributions for the benefit of the holders of the floater certificates and has also arranged for a liquidity facility  issued by a consortium of highly rated european banks  with respect to the floater certificates 
the company owns no beneficial interest in  and does not control  the certificate trust 
the effect of the top structure is that a portion of the interest received by the owner trust on the fmbs it holds is distributed through the senior certificate to the holders of the floater certificates in an amount determined each week by the remarketing agent  goldman sachs co  at the distribution amount that is required to enable the remarketing agent to sell the floater certificates at par on any weekly determination date  with the residual interest remitted to the origination trust via the residual certificate

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities

such factors include  among other things  the following general economic and business conditions  which will  among other things  affect the availability and creditworthiness of prospective tenants  lease rents and the terms and availability of financing  adverse changes in the real estate markets including  among other things  competition with other companies  risks of real estate development and acquisition  governmental actions and initiatives  and environment safety requirements 
inflation inflation did not have a material effect on the company s results for the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the nature of the company s investments and the instruments used to raise capital for their acquisition expose the company to gains and losses due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental policies  domestic and international political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
the fmbs generally bear interest at fixed rates  or pay interest according to the cash flows of the underlying properties  which do not fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
in contrast  payments required under the top program and on the secured borrowings under the p float program vary based on market interest rates  primarily bond market association bma and are re set weekly 
thus  an increase in market interest rates would result in increased payments under these financing programs  without a corresponding increase in cash flows from the investments in fmbs 
for example  based on the  outstanding under these financing programs at december   the company estimates that an increase of in the bma rate would decrease the company s annual net income by approximately  a increase in bma would decrease annual net income by approximately  for the same reasons  a decrease in market interest rates would generally benefit the company  as a result of decreased allocations to the minority interest and interest expense without corresponding decreases in interest received on the fmbs  in the same amounts as described above 
during june of  a subsidiary of the company completed a million preferred offering 
these preferred shares carry a fixed dividend rate of through june   and so are not impacted by changes in market interest rates 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow company management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s cash flows and earnings 
although management has not engaged in any of these hedging strategies in the past  it may do so in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies 
changes in market interest rates would also impact the estimated fair value of the company s portfolio of fmbs 
the company estimates the fair value for each fmb as the present value of its expected cash flows  using a discount rate for comparable tax exempt investments 
therefore  as market interest rates for tax exempt investments increase  the estimated fair value of the company s fmbs will generally decline  and a decline in interest rates would be expected to result in an increase in the estimated fair values 
for example  the company projects that a increase in market rates for tax exempt investments would decrease the estimated fair value of its portfolio of fmbs from its december  value of  to approximately  a decline in interest rates would increase the value of the december  portfolio to approximately  changes in the estimated fair value of the fmbs do not impact the company s reported net income  earnings per share  distributions or cash flows  but are reported as components of other comprehensive income and affect reported shareholders equity
