these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties  and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below under risk factors as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this report 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of medical products designed to safely and effectively assist or replace the pumping function of the failing heart 
we have been developing the abiocor  a totally implantable  battery powered  replacement heart which we believe will be the first such device for end stage heart failure patients 
we currently manufacture and sell the bvs  a temporary heart assist device which is the only device approved by the fda as a bridge to recovery device for temporary treatment of all patients with failing but potentially recoverable hearts 
our operating results reflect the dual activities of commercial operations and investments in the research and development of new technologies 
the bvs is a temporary heart assist device designed to assume the full pumping function of a patient s failing heart while allowing the heart to rest  heal and recover its function 
the bvs consists of a pneumatic drive and control console  single use external blood pumps and cannulae 
all of our product revenues are currently derived from the bvs product line 
bvs revenues are split between sales to new customers and reorders from existing customers 
following commercial introduction of the bvs in the us  our focus was on obtaining market share beginning with the largest medical centers 
as of march   more than medical centers in the us had purchased the bvs  including of all major medical centers that perform more than heart surgeries annually 
while continuing to seek additional new customers for the bvs  we have shifted our focus to emphasize increasing usage and product reorders by existing customers 
product reorders currently represent approximately half of bvs product revenues 
during fiscal  no single customer represented more than of product revenues 
research and development is a significant portion of our operations 
our research and development efforts are focused on the development of new products  primarily related to heart assist and heart replacement  and the continued enhancement of the bvs and related technologies 
in fiscal  we incurred million in total research and development spending directed at the abiocor and million in total research and development spending directed at bvs improvements and development of other products 
these expenditures were partially offset by revenues from contracts and grants of million  the majority of which were from the nhlbi 
we retain rights to commercialize all technological discoveries and products resulting from these contracts and grants 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues year ended march  revenues products contracts total revenues costs and expenses cost of product revenues research and development selling  general and administrative total costs and expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss fiscal years ended march  and march  product revenues 
product revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in product revenues was primarily attributable to increased unit sales and increased average selling prices of bvs disposable blood pumps sold to existing customers  and was partially offset by a reduction in unit sales of bvs systems sold to new customers 
the portion of product revenues derived from sales of disposable blood pumps and related accessories and services increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the portion of product revenues derived from sales of bvs consoles decreased by million  or in fiscal from million in fiscal we believe that the increase in sales of blood pumps and the decline in sales of bvs systems to new customers was largely a result of a decision made at the beginning of fiscal to shift the focus of certain of our sales representatives from sales to new customers to increased support of existing customers in an effort to increase reorders of higher margin bvs blood pumps 
the increase in product revenues derived from disposable blood pumps is primarily the result of a increase in reorder unit sales of blood pumps during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
domestic product revenues included approximately million from sales type leases in fiscal and million in fiscal domestic sales accounted for and of total product revenue during the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
contract revenues 
contract revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately million of the contract revenues recognized in both periods were derived from our abiocor government contract 
the remaining contract revenues recorded were primarily derived from our abiobooster government contract and other government grants 
we account for contract revenues under our government contracts and grants as work is performed  provided that the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
through march   the government had appropriated all of the million abiocor contract amount  including the million appropriated and recognized as contract revenues during the quarter ended june  no amount remained to be recognized under the abiocor government contract as of march  as of march   our total backlog of research and development contracts and grants was million  including million for abiobooster research and development 
all of these contracts and grants contain provisions that make them terminable at the convenience of the government 
abiomed retains rights to commercialize all technological discoveries and products resulting from these efforts 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the majority of this decrease in cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was attributable to higher average selling prices for bvs blood pumps during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the same period of the prior year and to an increase in the proportion of higher margin bvs blood pumps sold relative to lower margin bvs console sales 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march   from million in the prior fiscal year 
research and development expenses were of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  and of total revenues in the prior year 
the increase in expenditures during the fiscal year ended march  was due primarily to increased spending for the abiocor  new products and enhancements for the bvs product line and technologies under government contracts and grants 
research and development expenses during the fiscal year ended march  included million of expenses incurred in connection with our development activities for the abiocor  compared to million in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
expenditures increased to of total revenues from of total revenues in the same period a year earlier 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased legal expenses and increased selling and marketing expenditures as a result of our implementing new programs designed to improve sales of our disposable blood pumps 
in fiscal  legal expenses included approximately million in third party fees and other direct costs associated with our successful defense in court of our rights to technology used in the transcutaneous energy transmission technology used as a component of our abiocor implantable replacement heart system 
approximately million in legal defense expenditures were incurred in fiscal interest and other income 
interest and other income consists primarily of interest earned on our investment balances  net of interest and other expenses 
interest and other income decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower average funds available for investment 
net loss 
net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million  or per share 
this compares to a net loss of approximately million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the losses for both years are primarily attributable to development and pre clinical testing costs associated with the abiocor 
fiscal years ended march  and march  product revenues 
product revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase in product revenues in fiscal was primarily attributable to a million  or  increase in domestic product revenues 
this was derived primarily from increased average selling prices of bvs disposable blood pumps offset by a decrease in international product revenues of million 
sales of blood pumps in fiscal included approximately million of reorder pump revenues shipped from backlog 
we generally operate with only a limited backlog 
without the effect of the shipment from backlog in  our domestic product revenues increased by million  or  in fiscal domestic unit sales of bvs blood pumps decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal without adjustment for the effect of this backlog but increased if the effect of the backlog is considered 
domestic product revenues included approximately million from sales type leases in fiscal and million in fiscal international revenues represented of product revenues in fiscal and in fiscal contract revenues 
contract revenues decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease in contract revenues in fiscal was primarily attributable to the level of government appropriation and work performed by us on phase ii of the abiocor government contract 
we account for contract revenues under our government contracts and grants as work is performed  provided that the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
through march   the government had appropriated million of the million phase ii abiocor development contract amount 
during fiscal  our expenditures under the abiocor development contract exceeded the appropriated amount 
as a result  in fiscal  we recognized as contract revenues all of the remaining million of the million appropriated under the abiocor development contract and used million of our own resources to fund abiocor development 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the changes in cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues were primarily attributable to increased average selling prices and the mix of products sold 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily the result of increased expenditures for labor  materials  and professional services related to development and testing of the abiocor and enhancements to the bvs 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will continue to be significant and may increase as a result of our plans to further develop and test the abiocor  enhancements to the bvs and other potential new products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase primarily reflected increased sales expenses  particularly increased personnel and sales commissions  related to the increase in product revenues  as well as additional administrative personnel and legal expenses 
interest and other income 
interest and other income remained consistent at million in both fiscal and fiscal discontinued operations 
discontinued operations consist of the net revenues  costs and expenses of our dental subsidiary  abiodent 
in fiscal  we made the decision to shift all of our focus to our core cardiovascular business and to discontinue our dental business 
the million loss from discontinued operations for the year ended march  represents a loss from dental operations of million  or per diluted share  and an estimated loss on the disposal of the business  its assets and extinguishment of liabilities of million  or per diluted share 
in fiscal  we incurred costs associated with the discontinuance of operations of million  and wrote off remaining net assets totaling million 
net loss 
net loss for fiscal was approximately million  or per diluted share 
this compares to a net loss of approximately million  or per diluted share  for fiscal the losses for both years are primarily attributable to development and pre clinical testing costs associated with the abiocor 
liquidity and capital resources we have supported our operations primarily with net revenues from sales of our bvs product line  government contracts and proceeds from our equity financings 
as of march   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities total million 
we also have a million line of credit from a bank that expires on october   which bears interest at the bank s prime rate at march  
during fiscal  operating activities used million of cash 
net cash used by operating activities in fiscal reflected a net loss of million  including depreciation and amortization expense of million  and increases in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and million  respectively 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to extended collection periods for certain customer accounts 
the increase in inventory reflects increased production levels and our decision to increase inventory levels for certain products and component parts  including purchases of inventory related to the company s new bvs t  a backup unit to the current bvs  designed to allow transport of bvs supported patients between medical centers for specialized care 
the increase in accounts payable was primarily attributable to the timing of purchases of direct material and capital equipment for manufacturing  research and development 
the increase in accrued expenses reflects timing of payments and increased operating activity throughout abiomed  including increased size of payroll and payroll related costs  contractor support and legal charges 
during fiscal  investing activities provided million of cash 
approximately million in cash provided from the sale of short term marketable securities  net of purchases of similar securities  was partially offset by purchases of capital equipment and expenditures for leasehold improvements of million 
we also acquired an additional million in capital equipment by entering into a capital lease during fiscal in fiscal  we entered into an operating lease for  square feet of space in a building located within the same industrial park as our existing facilities 
during fiscal we also entered into month operating leases for an additional million in capital purchases of office furniture to be used in this new facility 
our purpose for this new facility is to consolidate our operations and to expand our manufacturing and research and development 
we began occupying this facility in fiscal  and we expect to complete our phased move into this facility in fiscal we anticipate that we will incur additional costs of approximately million for improvements to this facility  including costs to construct and qualify environmentally controlled manufacturing areas for our existing products and for our products under development 
financing activities generated million of cash during fiscal  primarily as a result of our completion of a public offering of  shares of common stock in march 
proceeds to the company from this offering  net of expenses  were approximately million 
income taxes incurred during fiscal were not material  and we continue to have significant net tax operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we believe that our revenue from government contracts and product sales and existing resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations  including the planned increases in our internally funded abiocor and new bvs development and product extension efforts  for the foreseeable future 
however  we may require significant additional funds in order to complete the development  conduct clinical trials  and achieve regulatory approvals of the abiocor and other products under development over the next several years 
we may also need additional funds for possible future strategic acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies complementary to our business 
if additional funds are required  we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of equity or from borrowings 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
current and prospective investors should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties described in this section and all of the other information in this report 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be severely harmed by any of the following risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline if any of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events 
our future success is heavily dependent on development of the abiocor 
our development efforts may not be successful 
we are currently devoting our principal research and development and regulatory efforts  and significant financial resources  to the development of the abiocor  an implantable replacement heart system 
an implantable replacement heart is a complex medical device and has never been successfully developed or marketed by any company 
the development of the abiocor and other new products  including our abiobooster and abiovest heart assist products  presents enormous challenges in a variety of areas  many or all of which we may have difficulty in overcoming  including blood compatible surfaces  blood compatible flow  manufacturing techniques  pumping mechanisms  physiological control  energy transfer  anatomical fit and surgical techniques 
for many years  we and other parties have been attempting to develop a heart replacement device  but  to date  none of these efforts has been successful 
we cannot be sure that we will be successful in our development efforts  and in the event that we are unable to commercialize the abiocor  our business and financial condition would be adversely affected 
the markets for the abiocor and our other products under development are unproven 
even if the abiocor or any other of our products are successfully developed and approved by the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities  they may not enjoy commercial acceptance or success  which would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
several factors could limit our success  including our need to create a market for an implantable replacement heart  and possible limited market acceptance among physicians  medical centers  patients and third party payors  the need for surgeons to develop or be trained in new surgical techniques to use our product effectively  limitations on the number of patients who may have access to physicians and medical centers with adequate training  equipment and personnel to make use of our products  limitations inherent in first generation devices  and the potential failure to develop successive improvements  including increases in service life  which would reduce the addressable market for the abiocor  the lifestyle limitations that patients will have to accept  including traveling with external batteries at all times and potentially avoiding activities such as air travel or diving that involve significant pressure changes  the timing and amount of reimbursement for these products  if any  by third party payors  the introduction by other companies of new treatments  products and technologies which compete with our products  and may reduce their market acceptance  or make them obsolete  the reluctance  due to ethical considerations  of physicians  patients and society as a whole to accept medical devices that replace the heart  and the reluctance of physicians  patients and society as a whole to accept the finite life and risk of mechanical failure of devices that replace the heart 
the commercial success of the abiocor and other heart assist products will require acceptance by cardiovascular surgeons and interventional and heart failure cardiologists  a limited number of whom significantly influence medical device selection and purchasing decisions 
we may achieve our business objectives only if the abiocor and our other products are accepted and recommended by leading physicians  which is likely to be based on a determination by these physicians that our products are safe  cost effective and represent acceptable methods of treatment 
although we have developed relationships with leading cardiac surgeons and cardiologists  we cannot assure that these existing relationships and arrangements can be maintained or that new relationships will be established in support of the abiocor and our other products 
if cardiovascular surgeons and cardiologists do not consider our products to be adequate for the treatment of our target cardiac patient population or if a sufficient number of physicians recommend and use competing products  it would seriously harm our business 
pre clinical and clinical testing of our new products will involve uncertainties and risks which could delay or prevent new product introductions  require us to incur substantial additional costs or result in our failure to bring our products to market 
prior to commencing clinical trials of the abiocor and our other products under development  we must perform pre clinical tests which consist of demonstrating performance  durability and reliability through laboratory and animal studies 
we could encounter significant delays or other setbacks in pre clinical testing 
prior to obtaining regulatory approvals in the us and other countries for the clinical testing in humans of the abiocor and other products  we must demonstrate in pre clinical testing that each product is safe and has the potential to be effective in humans for the intended duration of use 
we are now conducting pre clinical testing of the abiocor 
this testing may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in clinical trials 
a number of companies in the medical industry have suffered delays  cost overruns and project terminations despite achieving promising results in pre clinical testing 
in the event that we suffer setbacks in the pre clinical or clinical testing of the abiocor or other heart assist products  these products may be delayed  require further funding  and possibly may not be brought to market 
if we cannot demonstrate through clinical testing on humans that the abiocor or other new products are safe and effective  we will not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in the us or other countries for the commercial sale of these products 
delays  budget overruns  and project terminations are not uncommon even after promising pre clinical and clinical trials of medical products 
we intend to conduct clinical testing for the abiocor and other heart assist products with critically ill patients  and these patients may die or suffer other adverse medical results for reasons which may or may not be related to the product being tested 
those outcomes could seriously delay the completion of clinical testing  as could the unavailability of suitable patients for clinical trials  both of which are outside our control 
we cannot assure that the rate of patient enrollment in our clinical trials will be consistent with our expectations or be sufficient to allow us to complete our clinical trials for the abiocor or our other products under development in a timely manner  if at all 
delays could defer the marketing and commercial sale of our products  require further funding  and possibly result in failure to bring the products to market 
development and testing of design changes to the abiocor and other products under development is often extensive  expensive and time consuming 
some of the tests for our products may require months or years to perform  and we could be required to begin these tests again if we modify one of our products to correct a problem identified in testing 
even modest changes to certain components of our products can take months or years to complete and test 
if results of pre clinical or clinical testing of the abiocor or other products under development indicate that design changes are required  such changes could cause serious delays that would adversely affect our results of operations 
if we fail to obtain approval from the fda and from foreign regulatory authorities  we cannot market and sell the abiocor or other new heart assist products in the us and in other countries 
obtaining required regulatory approvals may take several years to complete and consume substantial capital resources 
we cannot assure that the fda or any other regulatory authority will act quickly or favorably on our requests for product approval  or that the fda or any other regulatory authority will not require us to provide additional data that we do not currently anticipate in order to obtain product approvals 
we cannot apply for fda approval to market the abiocor and our other products under development until the product successfully completes its pre clinical and clinical trials 
several factors could prevent successful completion or cause significant delays of these trials  including an inability to enroll the required number of patients or failure to demonstrate adequately that the product is safe and effective for use in humans 
if safety problems develop  the fda could stop our trials before completion 
in addition  we are planning to conduct phased clinical trials for the abiocor tailored to specific patient populations with different life expectancies 
if we are successful in obtaining fda approvals for the abiocor based on this phased approach  the initial approvals are likely to include conditions or limitations to particular indications that would limit the available market for these products 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for use of the abiocor or our other products under development  or if the patient populations for which they are approved are not sufficiently broad  the commercial success of these products could be limited 
we intend to market the abiocor and our other new products in international markets  including the european union and japan 
we must obtain separate regulatory approvals in order to market our products in other jurisdictions 
the approval process may differ among those jurisdictions and approval in the us or in any other jurisdiction does not ensure approval in other jurisdictions 
obtaining foreign approvals could result in significant delays  difficulties and costs for us  and require additional trials and additional expense 
if we obtain regulatory approval of our new products  the products will be subject to continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements  which could affect the manufacturing and marketing of our products 
the fda continues to review products even after they have received initial approval 
if and when the fda approves the abiocor or our other products under development  the manufacture and marketing of these products will be subject to continuing regulation  including compliance with current quality systems regulations and good manufacturing practices  known as qsr gmp  adverse event reporting requirements and prohibitions on promoting a product for unapproved uses 
we will also be required to obtain additional approvals in the event we significantly modify the design of an approved product or the product s labeling or manufacturing process 
modifications of this type are common with new products  and we anticipate that the current first generation of the abiocor will undergo a number of changes  refinements and improvements over time 
for example  the current configuration of the abiocor s thoracic unit  or replacement heart  is sized for patients with relatively large chest cavities  and we anticipate that we will need to obtain regulatory approval of thoracic units of other sizes 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approval of modifications to our current and future products  the commercial success of these products would be limited 
we and our third party suppliers of product components are also subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda for qsr gmp and other requirements 
enforcement actions resulting from failure to comply with government requirements could result in fines  suspensions of approvals  recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  and affect the manufacture and marketing of our products 
the fda could withdraw a previously approved product from the market upon receipt of newly discovered information  including a failure to comply with regulatory requirements  the occurrence of unanticipated problems with products following approval  or other reasons  which could adversely affect our operating results 
the cost of developing and manufacturing the abiocor and our other planned new products is substantial for a company of our size and will exert a strain on our available resources 
in recent years we have significantly increased our research and development expenditures for the abiocor  and we expect that this trend will continue in the future 
we will also need to make significant expenditures to begin to manufacture and market the abiocor and our other planned new products in commercial quantities for sale in the us and other countries  if and when we obtain regulatory approval to do so 
we cannot be sure that our estimates of capital expenditures for the abiocor and the development of our other new products will be accurate 
we could have significant cost overruns  which could reduce our ability to commercialize our products 
any delay or inability to commercialize our products under development could adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations 
we do not operate at a profit and do not expect to be profitable for some time 
we had a net loss of million in fiscal and a net loss of million in fiscal we are committed to making large expenditures for the abiocor and  to a lesser extent  other new products  in fiscal and subsequent fiscal years  which may result in losses in future periods 
these expenditures include costs associated with performing pre clinical and clinical trials for the abiocor  continuing our research and development relating to the abiocor and other new products  seeking regulatory approvals for the abiocor and  if we receive these approvals  commencing commercial manufacturing and marketing of the abiocor 
the amount of these expenditures is difficult to forecast accurately  and cost overruns may occur 
we plan to fund a portion of these expenditures from our limited existing financial resources and revenues from bvs sales  which are variable and uncertain 
we cannot be sure that we will have the necessary funds to develop and commercialize our new products  or that additional funds will be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event that we are unable to obtain the necessary funding to develop and commercialize our products  our business may be adversely affected 
our operating results may fluctuate unpredictably 
our annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated historically and we expect these fluctuations to continue 
among the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate are costs we incur in developing and testing the abiocor and other new products or product enhancements  the timing of regulatory actions  such as product approvals or recalls  costs we incur in anticipation of future sales  such as inventory purchases  expansion of manufacturing facilities  or establishment of international sales offices  the timing of customer orders and deliveries  particularly of bvs consoles  which are priced significantly higher than the single use bvs blood pumps  competitive changes  such as price changes or new product introductions that we or our competitors may make  the timing of government appropriations related to our research contracts and grants  and economic conditions in the health care industry and the state of cost containment efforts  including reimbursement policies 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical and future results will not necessarily be meaningful  and that investors should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
to the extent we experience the factors described above  our future operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors from time to time  which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the bvs product line  our principal product and current primary source of revenues  is vulnerable to competitive pressures  disruptions in sales  continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements 
all of our product revenues to date have come from sales of the bvs line of products 
we believe that we will continue to be dependent on our bvs product line for at least the next several years  unless and until we are able to successfully develop or acquire  obtain regulatory approval for  and sell new products 
in the event that a competitor were to introduce new treatments  products and technologies which compete with our products  add new features to their existing products or reduce their prices to make their products more financially attractive to customers  our revenue from our bvs products could decline 
for example  in the event of the expansion of technologies which allow heart surgical procedures to be performed without stopping the heart  a reduction in the market for the bvs could potentially result 
further  the bvs is subject to stringent and continuing fda and other regulatory requirements  including compliance with qsr gmp  adverse event reporting  prohibitions on promoting the bvs for unapproved uses  and continued inspection and market surveillance by the fda 
if bvs products are recalled or otherwise withdrawn from the market  our revenues would likely decline  which would hurt our business 
in addition  variations in the quantity and timing of sales of bvs consoles have a disproportionate effect on our revenues  because the price of the console is substantially greater than the price of our disposable blood pumps 
if we cannot maintain and increase our revenues from our bvs product line  our overall business and financial condition could be adversely affected 
revenues from our bvs product line in fiscal increased by from revenues in fiscal  and in fiscal our bvs revenues increased by from revenues in fiscal to maintain or increase revenues from sales of our bvs products  we may be required to adopt new sales and marketing strategies  some of which may require expending additional capital resources 
the new strategies we may adopt include promoting increased use of the bvs by existing customers in order to increase disposable blood pump sales to those customers  selling the bvs to smaller hospitals and medical centers in the us  regularly introducing enhancements to the bvs  expanding sales of our bvs product line in international markets  some of which require separate regulatory approvals  and seeking new categories of patients to support with the device 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in carrying out these new strategies  our revenues may decline 
we may not be successful in expanding our sales activities into international markets 
we are seeking to expand our international sales of the bvs and prepare for commercialization of the abiocor by recruiting direct sales and support teams for selected countries in europe and pursuing regulatory approval of the bvs in japan 
to date we have limited experience in selling the bvs internationally 
in fiscal  approximately  and in fiscal  approximately  of our revenues from the bvs product line were derived from international sales 
our international operations will be subject to a number of risks  which may vary from the risks we experience in the us  including the need to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign countries before our products may be sold or used  longer sales cycles  dependence on local distributors  limited protection of intellectual property rights  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies  and political and economic instability 
if we are unable to effectively expand our sales activities in international markets  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we depend on third party reimbursement to our customers for market acceptance of our products 
if third party payors fail to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for purchase and use of our products  our profitability would be adversely affected 
sales of medical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers 
the cost of our bvs system is substantial  and we anticipate that the cost of implanting the abiocor in a patient will also be substantial 
without the financial support of the government or third party insurers  the market for our products will be limited 
medical products and devices incorporating new technologies are closely examined by governments and private insurers to determine whether the products and devices will be covered by reimbursement  and if so  the level of reimbursement which may apply 
we cannot be sure that third party payors will reimburse sales of our products now under development  or enable us to sell them at profitable prices 
we also cannot be sure that third party payors will continue the current level of reimbursement to physicians and medical centers for use of the bvs 
any reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our business 
the federal government and private insurers have considered ways to change  and have changed  the manner in which health care services are provided and paid for in the us in the future  it is possible that the government may institute price controls and further limits on medicare and medicaid spending 
these controls and limits could affect the payments we collect from sales of our products 
internationally  medical reimbursement systems vary significantly  with some medical centers having fixed budgets  regardless of levels of patient treatment  and other countries requiring application for  and approval of  government or third party reimbursement 
even if we succeed in bringing our new products to market  uncertainties regarding future health care policy  legislation and regulation  as well as private market practices  could affect our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities at profitable prices 
prior to approving coverage for new medical devices  most third party payors require evidence that the product has received fda approval  is not experimental  and is medically necessary for the specific patient 
increasingly  third party payors require evidence that the devices being used are cost effective 
the abiocor and our other products under development may not meet these or future criteria  which could hurt our ability to market and sell these products 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our products require or if we are unable to develop additional manufacturing capacity  we will not be successful 
our products require precise  high quality manufacturing 
our failure to achieve and maintain these high manufacturing standards  including the incidence of manufacturing errors  design defects or component failures  could result in patient injury or death  product recalls or withdrawals  delays or failures in product testing or delivery  cost overruns or other problems that could seriously hurt our business 
we have from time to time voluntarily recalled certain products 
despite our very high manufacturing standards  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of errors  defects or failures 
in addition  we are planning to move into a new manufacturing facility in  and this move could disrupt manufacturing of our products 
we cannot be certain that the products manufactured in the new facility will be manufactured at the same cost and quality as the bvs and abiocor are currently being manufactured 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain iso certification of our new facility or approval by regulatory authorities 
if we are not able to manufacture the bvs in accordance with necessary quality standards  our business and results of operations may be negatively affected 
the abiocor involves even greater manufacturing complexities than our current product line 
the abiocor must be significantly more durable and meet different standards  which may be more difficult to achieve  than those which apply to our current product  the bvs 
if we are unable to manufacture the abiocor or other future products on a timely basis at acceptable quality and cost and in commercial quantities  or if we experience unanticipated technological problems or delays in production  our business will suffer 
the manufacture of our products is and will continue to be complex and costly  requiring a number of separate processes and components 
achieving precision and quality control requires skill and diligence by our personnel 
further  to be successful  we believe we will need to increase our manufacturing capacity 
we may experience difficulties in scaling up manufacturing of our new products  including problems related to product yields  quality control and assurance  component and service availability  adequacy of control policies and procedures  and lack of skilled personnel 
if we cannot hire  train and retain enough experienced and capable scientific and technical workers  we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our current or future products at an acceptable cost and on time  which could limit market acceptance of our products or otherwise damage our business 
if our suppliers cannot provide the components we require  our ability to manufacture our products could be harmed 
we rely on third party suppliers to provide us with certain components used in the bvs  the abiocor  and our other products under development 
relying on third party suppliers makes us vulnerable to component part failures and to interruptions in supply  either of which could impair our ability to conduct clinical tests or to ship our products to our customers on a timely basis 
using third party vendors makes it difficult and sometimes impossible for us to test fully certain components  such as components on circuit boards  maintain quality control  manage inventory and production schedules and control production costs 
vendor lead times to supply us with ordered components vary significantly and can exceed six months or more 
both now and as we expand our manufacturing capacity  we cannot be sure that our suppliers will furnish us with required components when we need them 
these factors could make it more difficult for us to effectively and efficiently manufacture our products  and could adversely impact our results of operations 
some suppliers may be the only source for a particular component  which makes us vulnerable to cost increases and supply interruptions 
vendors may decide to limit or eliminate sales of certain products to the medical industry due to product liability or other concerns  and we might not be able to find a suitable replacement for those products 
manufacturers of our product components may be required to comply with fda or other regulatory manufacturing regulations and to satisfy regulatory inspections in connection with the manufacture of the components 
if we cannot obtain a necessary component  we may need to find  test and obtain regulatory approval for a replacement component  produce the component ourselves or redesign the related product  which would cause significant delay and could increase our manufacturing costs 
any of these events could adversely impact our results of operations 
intense competition could harm our financial performance 
intense competition  rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards in the heart assist markets could decrease demand for our products or make them obsolete 
some of the companies  universities and research organizations developing competing products have greater resources and experience than we have 
our competitors could commence and complete clinical testing of their products  obtain regulatory approvals and begin commercial scale manufacturing of their products faster than we are able to for our products 
they could develop superior products or products of similar quality at the same or lower prices 
in addition  our customers often have limited budgets 
consequently  our products compete against a broad range of medical devices and therapies for these limited funds 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete effectively and successfully in the markets in which we participate 
we own patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights and other intellectual property and know how that we believe gives us a competitive advantage 
if we cannot protect our intellectual property  competition could force us to lower our prices  which could hurt our profitability 
our intellectual property rights are and will continue to be a critical component of our success 
a substantial portion of our intellectual property rights relating to the abiocor and bvs is in the form of trade secrets  rather than patents 
in order to preserve certain proprietary information as trade secrets  we are required to restrict disclosure of information intended to constitute trade secrets to third parties 
we protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
certain of our consultants and third parties with whom we have business relationships may also provide services to other parties in the medical device industry  including companies  universities and research organizations that are developing competing products 
in addition  some of our former employees may seek employment with  and become employed by  our competitors 
we cannot assure that confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach  or that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors 
the loss of trade secret protection for technologies or know how relating to the abiocor or the bvs could adversely affect our business prospects 
our business position will also depend in part on our ability to defend our existing and future patents and rights and conduct our business activities free of infringement claims by third parties 
we intend to seek additional patents  but our pending and future patent applications may not be approved  may not give us a competitive advantage  and could be challenged by others 
patent proceedings in the us and in other countries may be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  patents issued by foreign countries may afford less protection than is available under us patent law  and may not adequately protect our proprietary information 
our competitors may independently develop proprietary technologies and processes which are the same as or substantially equivalent to ours  or design around our patents 
companies in the medical device industry typically obtain patents and frequently engage in substantial intellectual property litigation 
our products and technologies could infringe on the rights of others 
if a third party successfully asserts a claim for infringement against us  we may be liable for substantial damages  unable to sell products using that technology  or would have to seek a license or redesign the related product 
these alternatives may be uneconomical or impossible 
patent litigation could be costly  result in product development delays  and divert the efforts and attention of management from our business 
we have been defending a lawsuit that relates to a portion of the energy transmission technology used in the abiocor 
world heart corporation and ottawa heart institute research corporation filed suit against us in delaware in january  seeking damages and injunctive relief because they contend that a component of the abiocor infringes their intellectual property rights 
on february   the trial of this suit concluded with the jury unanimously finding in our favor on all claims presented to it 
the plaintiffs have filed a motion for a new trial  which motion is pending 
if a new trial is granted and if we are not successful in the new trial  we may be required to use or develop alternate energy transmission technology  seek a license from a third party  or modify the design of the abiocor 
we may not be able to develop a reasonable alternative design on a timely  cost effective basis and we may not be able to obtain a license at reasonable cost or on a timely basis 
in either case  our failure to win the lawsuit could hurt our ability to develop or market the abiocor  which would adversely affect our business prospects 
if we cannot attract and retain the management  sales and other personnel we need  we will not be successful 
we depend heavily on the contributions of the principal members of our technical  sales and support  regulatory and clinical  operating and administrative management and staff  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
competition for skilled and experienced management  scientific personnel and sales personnel in the medical devices industry is intense 
if we lose the services of any of the principal members of our management and staff  or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future  especially scientific and sales personnel  our business could be adversely affected 
we expect to grow rapidly if the abiocor and our other products under development advance through the approval process 
the expansion of personnel and facilities will strain our management and our financial and other resources 
if we cannot manage this growth successfully  our business will likely suffer 
product liability claims could damage our reputation and hurt our financial results 
the clinical use of medical products  even after regulatory approval  poses an inherent risk of product liability claims 
we maintain limited product liability insurance coverage  subject to deductibles and exclusions 
we cannot be sure that product liability insurance will be available in the future or will be available on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs  or that such insurance will provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
claims against us  regardless of their merit or potential outcome  may also hurt our ability to obtain physician endorsement of our products or expand our business 
many patients using the bvs do not survive 
there are many factors beyond our control that could result in patient death  including the condition of the patient prior to use of the product  the skill and reliability of physicians and hospital personnel using and monitoring the product  and product maintenance by customers 
however  the failure of the bvs or other life support products we distribute for clinical test or sale could give rise to product liability claims and negative publicity 
the risk of product liability claims could increase as we introduce new products like the abiocor that are intended to support a patient until the end of life 
the abiocor will have a finite life and could cause unintended complications to other organs and may not be able to successfully support all patients 
its malfunction could give rise to product liability claims whether or not it has extended or improved the quality of the patient s life 
we cannot be sure that we can obtain liability insurance to cover the bvs  the abiocor or other new products at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if we have to pay product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage  our financial condition will be adversely affected 
we have depended on government contracts to support a significant portion of our basic research and development 
this funding may not continue 
we generally rely on external funding for a significant portion of our basic product research and development 
the primary source of this external funding is government research contracts and grants 
we have obtained this type of funding for the initial development of most of our current products and products under development 
in particular  the national heart  lung and blood institute  or nhlbi  awarded us a four year  million extension to our abiocor development contract in september  and a five year  million contract for the development of the abiobooster in september as of march   we had recognized all of the revenue under the abiocor development contract and all but million of the revenue under the abiobooster contract 
we have not determined the extent to which  if at all  we will seek additional government funding for the abiocor or the abiobooster  or new government funding for our other products under development 
we cannot assure that any such funding will be available  if we decide to seek it 
funding for all our government research and development contracts is subject to government appropriation  and all of these contracts contain provisions which make them terminable at the convenience of the government 
the government could terminate or reduce or delay the funding for any of our contracts at any time 
in the event that we are not successful in obtaining any new government contracts or further extensions to existing research and development contracts  our financial results could be adversely affected 
our rights distribution  certificate of incorporation and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and may prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium on our stock 
our rights distribution and provisions of our certificate of incorporation and of the delaware general corporation law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would allow our stockholders to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our stock 
our rights distribution and those provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law are intended to encourage potential acquirors to negotiate with us and allow our board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value 
however  such provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control  which could negatively affect our stock price 
the market value of our common stock could vary significantly  based on market perceptions of the status of our development efforts 
the perception of securities analysts regarding our product development efforts could significantly affect our stock price 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could change substantially when we or our competitors make product announcements  particularly announcements relating to the abiocor or competing products 
many factors affecting our stock price are industry related and beyond our control 
if we make acquisitions  we could encounter difficulties that harm our business 
we may acquire companies  products or technologies that we believe to be complementary to our business 
if we do so  we may have difficulty integrating the acquired personnel  operations  products or technologies 
these difficulties may disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses  which could hurt our business 
future sales of our common stock could adversely affect our stock price 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as of june   we had outstanding  shares of common stock  plus  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options 
all of the outstanding shares of our common stock are freely saleable except shares held by our affiliates  which are subject to certain limitations on sales 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
however  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of federal agency obligations  state and municipal bonds  and us treasury notes with maturities of one year or less 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at march   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio
