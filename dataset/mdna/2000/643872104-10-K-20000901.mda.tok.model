any sentence followed by an asterisk in this section constitutes a forward looking statement which reflects the company s current expectations 
there can be no assurance the company s actual performance will not differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements due to the important factors described in the section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations titled certain factors that may affect future results 
results of operations versus over the past several years the company has made a series of acquisitions intended to augment the three segments of the company s business 
the first two segments  printed products direct marketing and printed products direct sales  sell primarily printed business products 
the third segment  packaging and display products  serves as a reseller of packing and shipping supplies and retail signage 
net sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal year from million in fiscal year the net sales increase was due to growth in sales of seasonal holiday cards and personalized work clothing sold principally through the direct marketing segment 
net sales increased in the packaging and display segment primarily as a result of expanded distribution facilities 
in the direct selling segment  net sales growth was attributable to an increase in orders derived from bank referral contracts 
for fiscal year  cost of sales decreased to of sales from in fiscal year this decrease was partially due to increased handling charges billed to customers which helped to offset transportation costs 
in addition  there were increased efficiencies in the company s us operating units primarily selling business forms and related printed products tied in part to the completion of acquisition integration activities in fiscal cost of sales as a percentage of sales is anticipated to increase during fiscal year with the inclusion of premiumwear 
selling and advertising expense increased to of sales in fiscal year from of sales in fiscal year the increase was due primarily to the direct sales force employed by mcbee and their higher sales growth 
mcbee s sales force generates a higher selling and advertising expense as a percentage of sales than in the company s other businesses  as the revenue growth in the direct selling segment is increasing at a faster rate than in other segments they will disproportionately affect consolidated trends 
this increase was partially offset by reduced direct mail costs 
selling and advertising expense as a percentage of sales is expected to decrease slightly during fiscal year due to the inclusion of premiumwear 
general and administrative expense increased to of sales in fiscal year from in fiscal year during fiscal year  the company continued to increase spending levels associated with its program to re engineer financial and operational information systems 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales is expected to increase slightly during fiscal year due to an increase in spending on information systems 
interest expense remained consistent at of sales in fiscal year and the company anticipates that  while on an absolute basis  borrowing costs will increase due to the aforementioned premiumwear acquisition  the percentage relationship to sales should remain relatively consistent 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year primarily as a result of a one time tax benefit due to a favorable state revenue ruling effecting both current and prior years taxes 
the company anticipates that its effective tax rate for fiscal year  including the results of the ruling and the effect of the premiumwear acquisition  will increase to approximately 
the company will continue to seek opportunities to acquire companies  businesses and product lines to enhance the company s competitive position in the marketplace or to gain access to new markets  products  competencies or technologies such as the premiumwear acquisition completed in july in addition  the company will continue to seek opportunities to enhance the cost structure of the company  to improve operating efficiencies  and to fund investments in support of the company s strategies 
versus net sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal year from million in fiscal year the rapidforms and mcbee acquisitions during fiscal were primarily responsible for the combined sales increase of approximately million  or  in the printed products direct marketing and printed products direct sales segments 
the remaining increase in sales  million  or  was attributable to growth in the packaging and display products segment  which was primarily the result of the rapidforms acquisition as one of its former subsidiaries is classified in this segment 
for fiscal year  cost of sales decreased to of sales from in fiscal year this decrease was due to an increase in revenue generated by higher margin products associated with the acquisition of mcbee  increased handling charges billed to customers which help offset transportation charges and increased efficiencies in the company s us operating units selling primarily business forms and related printed products due  in part  to acquisition integration related efficiencies 
these factors counteracted the impact of million in costs incurred in fiscal year in conjunction with activities related to integration of manufacturing facilities among its printed products plants as well as decreasing margins due to product mix shift away from the company s core printed products at nebs and rapidforms 
selling and advertising expense increased to of sales in fiscal year from of sales in fiscal year the increase was due primarily to the direct sales force employed by mcbee which generates a higher selling and advertising expense as a percentage of sales than in the company s other businesses 
the company also incurred  in costs during the year in connection with efforts to harmonize product offerings among its rapidforms  mcbee and nebs direct marketing 
in addition  amortization expense related to the intangible assets of acquisitions climbed from of sales in fiscal year to of sales in fiscal year due to the effect of intangible assets created in the mcbee acquisition and the full year impact of the rapidforms acquisition 
general and administrative expense remained flat at of sales in fiscal year and the year to year similarity was the result of a lower ratio of general and administrative expense to sales associated with the company s mcbee subsidiary  which offset  of general and administrative spending related primarily to systems integration efforts within the printed products operations 
during fiscal year  the company continued to increase spending levels associated with its program to re engineer financial and operational information systems 
it should be noted that the adoption of aicpa statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  reduced amounts charged to expense in fiscal by  during fiscal year  the company amended its defined benefit pension plan for canadian employees of nebs business forms  ltd 
to freeze participation and to allow participants to rollover accrued benefits under the plan to a defined contribution retirement plan 
the company recorded a curtailment gain of  during fiscal year associated with the freeze and resultant benefit rollover 
during fiscal year  the company settled this plan and recorded a settlement gain of  interest expense increased over the prior year to of sales in fiscal year compared to of sales in fiscal year this increase in expense was attributable to debt incurred to finance the acquisitions of rapidforms in december  and mcbee in june  the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year due to a reduction in the company s effective state tax rate 
new accounting pronouncements in june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard will be adopted by the company in fiscal year management believes that the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements will not be material 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
this sab was intended to clarify certain elements of revenue recognition 
it is currently being supplemented by a frequently asked questions document and is required to be implemented by the company no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal management believes that this sab will not materially impact its revenue recognition practices 
the emerging issues task force is currently debating issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling revenues and costs 
specifically  it is formulating conclusions as to how a seller of goods should classify revenues and costs attributable to shipping and handling in the income statement 
no final conclusion has been reached 
the company currently nets such revenues and expenses in the cost of sales line 
should the emerging issues task force reach a consensus that such financial statement presentation should be changed  management will effect such a reclassification  and will restate previous periods  as appropriate 
there would be no effect on reported net income 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities amounted to million in fiscal year  approximately million  or  higher than the million provided in fiscal year this increase in cash provided by operating activities was composed principally of a million increase in net income  million in non cash depreciation and million in the amount of cash provided by working capital and other non cash adjustments to reported net income 
in fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities increased million  or  from the million dollars provided in fiscal year due principally to a million increase in net income and a million increase in non cash depreciation and amortization expense  offset in part by an increase of million in the amount of cash used by working capital and other non cash adjustments to reported net income 
working capital as of june  amounted to million  including million of cash and short term investments 
this represents an increase of million from the working capital balance of million  including cash and short term investments of million  at the end of fiscal year this increase in working capital is not a significant change from the prior year 
excluding the addition of working capital associated with the acquisition of premiumwear  the company does not expect to experience any significant change to the amount of working capital investment required to support its business during fiscal year working capital increased in fiscal year by million principally due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities and the addition of the working capital balances of companies acquired during fiscal year capital expenditures of million in fiscal year represented a million increase from the million expended in fiscal year and a million increase from the million expended in fiscal year capital expenditures over the three year period have included significant investment in the purchase  development and implementation of information systems infrastructure and operating systems including the company s websites 
in addition  capital expenditures in fiscal year included investment of million in a leased distribution center in georgia  in fiscal year a million expansion of the company s midland  ontario manufacturing facility  and in fiscal year the construction of a million telemarketing facility in flagstaff  arizona 
the company expects capital expenditures to approximate million in fiscal year  which will include additional planned improvements in information systems infrastructure and the company s websites  and investments to expand embroidery and distribution capacity at premiumwear 
the company repurchased  shares of the company s common stock for million in cash during fiscal year and  shares of the company s common stock for million in cash during fiscal year the company did not repurchase any shares of common stock in fiscal in addition  the company declared and paid a cash dividend of 
per share during each of the last three fiscal years  amounting to a total of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition to its present cash and short term investment balances  the company has consistently generated sufficient cash internally to fund its needs for working capital  dividends and capital expenditures 
the company currently has a committed  unsecured  revolving credit agreement for million which matures on december  at june   the company had million of outstanding debt under this credit facility 
the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants which  among other things  require the company to maintain certain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and specific consolidated debt and fixed charge ratios 
as of june   the company was in compliance with these provisions 
in order to effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of the debt outstanding under the revolving line of credit  the company has entered into three interest rate swap agreements with two of the banks party to the credit agreement 
these swap agreements contain notional principal amounts and other terms determined with respect to the company s forecasts of future cash flows and borrowing requirements 
at june   the notional principal amount outstanding under the interest rate swap agreements totaled million 
the company anticipates that its current cash on hand  cash flow from operations and additional availability under the line of credit will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity requirements for its operations and capital expenditures during fiscal year however  the company may pursue additional acquisitions from time to time  such as the acquisition mentioned in overview  which would likely be funded through the use of available cash  the issuance of stock  the obtaining of additional credit  or any combination thereof 
certain factors that may affect future results references in this section to we  us and our refer to new england business service  inc we may make forward looking statements in this report and in other documents filed with the sec  in press releases  and in discussions with analysts  investors and others 
these statements include 
descriptions of our operational and strategic plans  
expectations about our future sales and profits  
views of conditions and trends in our markets  and 
other statements that include words like expects  estimates  anticipates  believes and intends  and which describe opinions about future events 
you should not rely on these forward looking statements as though they were guarantees 
these statements are based on our expectations at the time the statements are made  and we are not required to revise or update these statements based on future developments 
known and unknown risks may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these statements 
a majority of our sales and profits come from selling standardized business forms  checks and related products by mail order  telesales and direct sales to a target market consisting mainly of small businesses 
we believe that the critical success factors to compete in this market include competitive pricing  breadth of product offering  product quality and the ability to attract and retain a large number of individual customers 
known material risks that may affect those critical success factors are described below 
our core business faces increased competition from new sources  such as office supply superstores and internet based vendors 
increased competition may require us to reduce prices or offer other incentives in order to attract new customers and retain existing customers  which could reduce our profits 
low price  high volume office supply chain stores have entered our core business of selling standardized business forms  checks and related products to small businesses 
because of their size  these superstores have the buying power to offer these products at competitive prices 
these superstores also offer the convenience of one stop shopping for a broad array of office supplies that we do not offer 
in addition  national superstore competitors have greater financial strength to reduce prices or increase promotional discounts in order to seek or retain market share 
recently  internet based vendors have begun to compete in our core business 
these vendors include both start up ventures as well as the online sites of the office supply national chains 
one business model for many internet based vendors is to seek market share as rapidly as possible through significantly reduced prices and deep discounting 
if any of these new competitors seek to gain or retain market share through price reductions or increased discounting  we may be forced to reduce our prices or match the discounts in order to stay competitive  which could reduce our profits 
technological improvements may reduce our competitive advantage over our smaller competitors  which could reduce our profits 
historically  our relatively greater financial strength and size has enabled us to offer a broader array of products  particularly those having a complex construction  at lower prices than the small local and regional dealers  distributors and printers who constitute our primary competition 
improvements in the cost and quality of printing technology are enabling these smaller competitors to gain access to products of complex design and functionality at competitive costs 
increased competition from local and regional competitors could force us to reduce our prices in order to attract and retain customers  which could reduce our profits 
because our long term sales growth is dependent on our ability to continually attract new customers in our target small business market  economic events that adversely affect the small business economy may reduce our sales and profits 
average annual sales per customer of our core products have remained relatively stable over time 
as a result  we rely  in part  on continually attracting new customers for these mature products 
our sales and profits have been adversely affected in the past by recession related contractions in the small business economy 
we expect that our sales and profits will continue to be affected by changes in the levels of small business formations and failures and from other economic events that affect the small business economy generally 
because our long term sales growth is dependent on our ability to continually attract new customers in our target small business market  changes in the direct marketing industry that reduce our competitive advantage in contacting prospective customers may reduce our sales and profits 
growth in the total number of our direct mail customers depends on continued access to high quality lists of newly formed small businesses 
in the past  our ability to compile proprietary prospect lists was a distinct competitive advantage 
however  the external list compilation industry has grown more sophisticated and comprehensive lists of new small business formations are now commercially available to our competitors 
in addition  the internet has the potential to eliminate our advantage of scale in direct marketing by providing all competitors  regardless of current size  with access to prospective customers 
we currently rely on the speed of our delivery of promotional materials to prospective customers to gain advantage over competitors 
we are also expanding our internet product offerings and capabilities and seeking to increase our visibility on the internet 
notwithstanding these efforts  a deterioration in our competitive advantage in contacting prospective customers could reduce our sales and profits 
in addition  the enactment of privacy laws could constrain our ability to obtain prospect lists or telemarket to prospective customers 
increase in the cost of paper and in postal rates increase our costs  which we may be unable to offset by reducing costs in other areas or by raising prices 
the cost of paper to produce our products  catalogs and advertising materials makes up a significant portion of our total costs 
we also rely on the us postal service to deliver most of our promotional materials 
prices for the various types of paper that we use have been volatile  and we expect them to continue to be so 
third class postal rates have generally increased over the past ten years  at times significantly 
we are not sure that we will always be able to reduce costs in other areas or increase prices for our products sufficiently to offset increases in paper costs and postal rates 
if we are unable to offset these cost increases  our profits will be adversely affected 
disruption in the services provided by certain of our critical vendors may adversely affect our operating performance and profits 
in order to obtain favorable pricing  we have selected a limited number of vendors to provide key services to our business 
examples of this are as follows 
mci worldcom provides most of the toll free telephone lines that we use in connection with our direct marketing business  
we use united parcel service to deliver most of the products that we ship to customers  
we use rr donnelley and sons for the printing and processing of most of the catalogs that we mail each year  
we rely on the postal services of the countries in which we do business to deliver our catalogs and other advertising to customers 
in the past  we have been adversely affected by disruption of some of these services due to labor actions  system failures  adverse weather conditions and other natural disasters 
if there are future interruptions in service from one or more of these vendors  we believe that there could be a significant disruption to our business due to our inability to readily find alternative service providers at comparable rates 
sales of our standardized forms products face technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences  which could reduce our sales and profits 
our standardized business forms  checks and related products provide our customers with financial and business records to manage their businesses 
continual technological improvements have provided our target customers in several market segments with alternative means to enact and record business transactions 
for example  the price and performance capabilities of personal computers and related printers now provide a cost competitive means to print low quality versions of our business forms on plain paper 
in addition  electronic transaction systems and off the shelf business software applications have been designed to automate several of the functions performed by our business form products 
in response to the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms business  we continue to develop our capability to provide custom and full color products 
however  we have less of a cost advantage with these products than with standardized forms  due to improvements in the cost and quality of printing technology available to our smaller local and regional competitors 
we are also seeking to introduce new products that are less susceptible to technological obsolescence 
we may develop new products internally  procure them from third party vendors  or obtain them through the acquisition of a new business 
we generally realize lower gross margins on out sourced products than on products that we manufacture ourselves 
the risks associated with the acquisition of new businesses are described below 
if new printing capabilities and new product introductions do not continue to offset the obsolescence of our standardized business forms products  there is a risk that the number of new customers we attract and existing customers we retain may diminish  which could reduce our sales and profits 
decreases in sales of our historically high margin standardized business forms products due to obsolescence could also reduce our gross margins 
this reduction could in turn adversely impact our profits unless we are able to offset the reduction through the introduction of new high margin products and services or realize cost savings in other areas 
our growth strategy depends  in part  on the acquisition of complementary businesses that address our target small business market 
the acquisition of complementary businesses that address our target small business market has been important to our growth strategy 
we intend to continue this acquisition activity in the future 
the success of this activity depends on the following 
our ability to identify suitable businesses and to negotiate agreements on acceptable terms  
our ability to obtain financing through additional borrowing  by issuing additional shares of common stock  or through internally generated cash flow  and 
our ability to achieve anticipated savings and growth and avoid disruption to our existing businesses 
in evaluating a potential acquisition  we conduct a business  financial and legal review of the target 
this review is intended to confirm our assumptions with respect to the projected future performance of the target and to identify the benefits and risks associated with those assumptions 
we cannot be certain that our review will identify all potential risks associated with the purchase  integration or operation of acquired businesses 
unanticipated risks may adversely affect the benefits that we expect to obtain from any given acquisition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a number of market risks  primarily due to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
investments in and loans and advances to foreign subsidiaries and branches  and their resultant operations  denominated in foreign currencies  create exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the company s utilization of its revolving line of credit which carries a variable interest rate creates an exposure to changes in interest rates 
the effect  however  of changes in exchange rates and interest rates on the company s earnings generally has been small relative to other factors that also affect earnings  such as business unit sales and operating margins 
this is because i foreign operations represent a relatively small portion of the company s total activity  the magnitude of foreign currency transactions has been minimal and forward foreign currency contracts have been historically entered into to hedge certain foreign exchange fluctuations  ii interest rates have not fluctuated significantly and a significant portion of the company s borrowings are fixed through interest rate swaps 
in order to effectively convert the interest rate of a portion of the company s debt from a eurodollar based floating rate to a fixed rate  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements with major commercial banks 
although the company is exposed to credit and market risk in the event of future nonperformance by any of the banks  management has no reason to believe that such an event will occur 
the company does  however  have a component of its borrowings that is not hedged 
a upward movement in interest rates would impact earnings and cash flows by approximately 
million because of this unhedged position 
for more information on these market risks and financial exposures  see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading  profit or speculative purposes 
as described above  while the company has historically hedged short term foreign exchange exposures  all such positions were closed in fiscal this is because the company either had its foreign subsidiaries repay any dollar advances or converted such advances to equity positions in the subsidiaries 
accordingly  as of the end of the year  the company had minimal exposure to exchange rate fluctuation 
upon reviewing its derivatives and other foreign currency and interest rate instruments  based on historical foreign currency rate movements and the fair value of market rate sensitive instruments at year end  the company does not believe that changes in foreign currency or interest rates will have a material impact on its near term earnings  fair values or cash flows
