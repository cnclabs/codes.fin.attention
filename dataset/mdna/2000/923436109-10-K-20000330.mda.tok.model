because we accounted for the nsmg  telebackup and nuview acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  we recorded developed technology  goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately  million in total 
these assets are being amortized over their estimated useful life of four years  and result in charges to operations of approximately million per quarter 
we also recorded one time non cash charges of million in our statements of operations in  related to the write off of in process research and development 
we also recorded a one time restructuring charge in of million related primarily to costs for our duplicative facilities that we plan to vacate 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this form k contains forward looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties which are described throughout this form k 
such forward looking statements consist of statements that are not purely historical  including  without limitation  statements regarding our expectations  beliefs  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
the actual results that veritas achieves may differ materially from those anticipated by any forward looking statements due to risks and uncertainties such as those described below under factors that may affect future results 
overview veritas is a leading independent supplier of storage management software 
storage management software has grown significantly in importance and market impact during the last few years 
computing operations have moved from being part of the infrastructural background of a business enterprise to being a critical component in the success of a business  particularly given businesses requirements that data remain protected and accessible at all times 
our products help our customers manage complex and diverse computing environments efficiently and cost effectively  by making sure that their data is protected  can be accessed at all times  and can be managed and used in compliance with business policies 
our products help to improve the levels of centralization  control  automation and manageability in computing environments  they allow information technology  or it  managers to be significantly more effective with constrained resources and limited budgets 
our products offer protection against data loss and file corruption  allow rapid recovery after disk or computer system failure  enable it managers and end users to work efficiently with large numbers of files  and make it possible to manage data distributed on large networks of computer systems without harming productivity or interrupting users 
they provide continuous availability of data in clustered computer systems that share disk resources to maintain smooth business operations and are highly scalable in order to keep up with the rapid growth of data and technologies deployed in businesses 
we develop and sell products for most popular operating systems  including versions of unix and windows nt 
our software solutions are used by customers across a broad spectrum of industries  including many leading global corporations and e commerce businesses 
we also provide a full range of services to assist our customers in planning and implementing their storage management solutions 
we market our products and services to original equipment manufacturers and end user customers through a combination of direct sales and indirect sales channels such as resellers  value added resellers  hardware distributors  application software vendors and systems integrators 
we derive user license fee revenue from shipments of our software products to end user customers through direct sales channels  indirect sales channels and original equipment manufacturer customers 
our original equipment manufacturer customers either bundle our products with the original equipment manufacturer products licensed by such original equipment manufacturers or offer them as options 
some original equipment manufacturers also resell our products 
we receive a royalty each time the original equipment manufacturer licenses to a customer a copy of the original equipment manufacturer s products that incorporates one or more of our products 
our license agreements with our original equipment manufacturer customers generally contain no minimum sales requirements and we cannot assure you that any original equipment manufacturer will either commence or continue shipping operating systems incorporating our products in the future 
when we enter into new agreements with original equipment manufacturer customers and resellers  a significant period of time may elapse before we realize any associated revenue  due to development work that we must generally undertake under these agreements and the time needed for the sales and marketing organizations within these customers and distributors to become familiar with and gain confidence in our products 
approximately  and of our net revenue was generated from original equipment manufacturer business during  and our services revenue consists of fees derived from annual maintenance agreements  from consulting and training services and from porting fees 
original equipment manufacturer maintenance agreements covering our products provide for technical and emergency support and minor unspecified product upgrades for a fixed annual fee 
maintenance agreements covering products that are licensed through channels other than original equipment manufacturers provide for technical support and unspecified product upgrades for an annual service fee based on the number of user licenses purchased and the level of service subscribed 
porting fees consist of fees derived from porting and other non recurring engineering efforts when we port  or adapt  our storage management products to an original equipment manufacturer s operating system and when we develop new product features or extensions of existing product features at the request of a customer 
in most cases  we retain the rights to technology derived from porting and non recurring engineering work and therefore generally perform this work on a relatively low  and sometimes negative  margin 
we have made  and intend to continue to make  substantial investments in porting our products to new operating systems  including windows nt 
the success of windows nt product development efforts depends in part on receipt of development funding from third parties  including microsoft  and failure to receive such funding could hamper our efforts to extend our products into the windows nt market 
the porting and development process requires substantial capital investment and our allocation of substantial employee resources to this effort  and our added focus on windows nt development in recent years has required  and will continue to require  us to hire additional personnel 
under an agreement with microsoft  we have agreed to develop a functional subset of our volume manager product that will be ported to and embedded in windows nt 
the agreement also requires us to develop a disk management graphical user interface designed specifically for windows nt 
microsoft has provided us with significant funding toward this development effort 
we recognize revenue under our development contract with microsoft on a percentage of completion basis consistent with our policy for revenue recognition for other similar agreements 
the payment terms in the microsoft agreement do not directly correlate to the timing of development efforts and therefore revenue recognition does not directly correlate to contract billings 
the microsoft agreement requires us to expand our marketing and sales operations to deal with higher volume markets in which we have limited experience 
our international sales are generated primarily through our international sales subsidiaries 
international revenue  most of which is collectible in foreign currencies  accounted for approximately of our total revenue in  of our total revenue in and of our total revenue in our international revenue increased to million in from million in  and from million in since much of our international operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies  which is the foreign subsidiaries functional currency  the relative impact of exchange rates on net income or loss is less than the impact on revenues 
although our operating and pricing strategies take into account changes in exchange rates over time  our operating results may be affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international subsidiaries purchase licenses for resale from the parent company resulting in intercompany receivables and payables 
these receivables and payables are carried on our books in the foreign currency that existed at the time of the transaction 
these receivables and payables are eliminated for financial statement reporting purposes 
prior to elimination  the amounts carried in foreign currencies are converted to the functional currency at the then current rate  or marked to market  which may give rise to currency remeasurement gains and losses 
such gains or losses are recognized on our statement of operations as a component of other income  net 
to date  such gains or losses have not been material 
we believe that our success depends upon continued expansion of our international operations 
we currently have sales and service offices and resellers located in north america  europe  asia pacific  south america and the middle east and a development center in india 
international expansion will require us to establish additional foreign offices  hire more personnel and recruit new international resellers  resulting in the diversion of significant management attention and the expenditure of financial resources 
to the extent that we are unable to meet these additional requirements  growth in international sales will be limited  which would have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
international operations also subject us to a number of risks inherent in developing and selling products outside the united states  including potential loss of developed technology  limited protection of intellectual property rights  imposition of government regulation  imposition of export duties and restrictions  cultural differences in the conduct of business  and political and economic instability 
furthermore  some global markets  including asia  russia and latin america  are currently undergoing significant economic turmoil that could result in deferral of purchase of information technology products and services by potential customers located in such markets  thereby further limiting our ability to expand international operations 
on may   we acquired the network storage management group business of seagate software  inc  which we refer to as nsmg 
on june  we acquired telebackup systems  inc  which we refer to as telebackup 
on august   we acquired certain assets of nuview  inc  which we refer to as nuview 
in the following paragraphs  all share and per share data have been restated to give retroactive effect to our stock splits effected as stock dividends through march  the nsmg business develops and markets software products and provides related services enabling information technology professionals to manage distributed network resources and to secure and protect enterprise data 
its products offer features such as system backup  disaster recovery  migration  replication  automated client protection  storage resource management  scheduling  event correlation and desktop management 
in connection with the nsmg acquisition  in consideration for the contribution of assets and liabilities related to the nsmg business by seagate technology  inc  seagate software  inc  and their respective subsidiaries  and based on the average closing price of our common stock of per share for days before and after june   the measurement date for the transaction  we issued  shares of our common stock to seagate software  inc and issued options to purchase  shares of our common stock to our employees who were former nsmg employees 
we accounted for the nsmg acquisition using the purchase method of accounting  and we are incurring charges of million per quarter primarily related to the amortization of developed technology  goodwill and other intangibles over their estimated useful life of four years 
the total nsmg purchase price was  million and included  million for the issuance of our common stock  million for the exchange of options to purchase our common stock and million of acquisition related costs 
the purchase price was allocated  based on an independent valuation  to goodwill of  million  distribution channels of million  original equipment manufacturer agreements of million  developed technology of million  assembled workforce of million  trademarks of million  in process research and development of million  net deferred tax liabilities of million  other intangibles of million and tangible net liabilities assumed of million 
for  we recorded million for the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  and million for the amortization of developed technology related to this acquisition 
acquisition related costs consist of direct transaction costs of million  operating lease commitments on duplicative facilities of million and involuntary termination benefits of million 
non cash charges included in the acquisition related costs approximate million 
at december   million in direct transaction costs  million in operating lease commitments on duplicative facilities and million in involuntary termination benefits were paid against the acquisition related costs accrual and million of non cash involuntary termination benefits were charged against the acquisition related costs accrual 
the remaining acquisition related costs accrual of million is anticipated to be utilized primarily for servicing operating lease payments or negotiated buyout of operating lease commitments  the lease terms of which will expire at various times through the year in addition  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in as a result of the nsmg acquisition 
this restructuring charge related to exit costs with respect to duplicative facilities that we plan to vacate  which include million of write off of redundant equipment and leasehold improvements  and involuntary termination benefits 
involuntary termination benefits relate to the salary and fringe benefit expense for terminated employees in research and development 
the involuntarily terminated employees represented of the global workforce 
at december   million in severance costs were paid against the restructuring charge accrual and million of write off of redundant equipment and leasehold improvements had been written off 
the remaining restructuring charge accrual of million is anticipated to be utilized primarily for servicing operating lease payments or negotiated buyout of operating lease commitments  the lease terms of which will expire at various times through the year telebackup designs  develops and markets software solutions for local and remote backup and recovery of electronic information stored on networked  remote and mobile personal computers 
telebackup became our wholly owned subsidiary in exchange for the issuance of  shares of either our common stock or exchangeable shares to the holders of telebackup common shares and the exchange of options to purchase  shares of our common stock to our employees who were former employees of telebackup 
we accounted for the telebackup acquisition using the purchase method of accounting  and we are incurring charges of million per quarter primarily related to the amortization of developed technology  goodwill and other intangibles over their estimated useful life of four years 
based on the average closing price of our common stock of per share for days before and after june   the measurement date for the transaction  the total purchase price for telebackup was million 
the telebackup purchase price included million related to the issuance of our common stock  million for the issuance of options to purchase our common stock and million in acquisition related costs 
the acquisition costs of million consist primarily of direct transaction costs and involuntary termination benefits 
at december   of the total million acquisition costs  we paid million in direct transaction costs with the majority of the remaining million anticipated to be utilized by august the purchase price was allocated  based on an independent valuation  to goodwill of million  distribution channels of million  original equipment manufacturer agreements of million  developed technology of million  assembled workforce of million  trademarks of million  in process research and development of million  net deferred tax liabilities of million and tangible net liabilities assumed of million 
for  we recorded million for amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  and million for the amortization of developed technology related to this acquisition 
under an asset purchase agreement  we acquired certain assets of nuview  including its windows nt cluster management solution  cluster x  for a total cost of approximately million 
we accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting  and we are incurring charges of million per quarter primarily related to the amortization of developed technology  goodwill and other intangibles over their estimated useful life of four years 
the purchase price included million related to the issuance of our common stock  million for the issuance of options to purchase our common stock to former nuview employees  million in acquisition related costs and million payable in cash  of which million has been paid

for  we recorded million for amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  and million for the amortization of developed technology related to this acquisition 
on april   we merged with openvision technologies  inc which we refer to as openvision 
the openvision merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests for financial reporting purposes 
as a result of the openvision merger  we incurred charges to operations of million in  consisting of approximately million for transaction fees and professional services  million for contract terminations and asset write offs and million for other costs incident to the openvision merger 
of the total charge  million resulted from the write down of redundant assets and facilities  primarily consisting of intangible assets related to a prior acquisition that became redundant as a result of openvision having a similar product line 
the remaining million  involving banking  legal and accounting fees and other direct costs and payments in connection with the elimination of duplicative facilities  was fully paid as of december  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenue 
years ended december  net revenue user license fees services total net revenue cost of revenue user license fees services amortization of developed technology total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other intangibles acquisition and restructuring costs in process research and development total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net interest expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenue net revenue increased to million in from million in  when it increased from million in while we believe that the percentage increases in net revenue achieved in these periods are not necessarily indicative of future results  we expect net revenue to continue to grow in our revenue comprises user license fees and service revenue 
user license fees 
user license fees increased to million in from million in  when it increased from million in the increase in was primarily the result of the acquisition of nsmg in the second quarter of  continued growth in market acceptance of our software products  a greater volume of large end user transactions  increased revenue from original equipment manufacturers  or oems  resales of bundled and unbundled products and the introduction of new products 
the increase in was primarily the result of the continued growth in market acceptance of our software products  a greater volume of large end user transactions  increased revenue from oem resales of bundled and unbundled products and the introduction of new products 
in particular  our user license fees from storage products increased by approximately in from  and accounted for of user license fees in  of user license fees in and of user license fees in service revenue 
we derive our service revenue is derived primarily from contracts for software maintenance and technical support and  to a lesser extent  consulting services  training services and porting fees 
porting fees are derived from funded development efforts that are typically associated with our agreements with original equipment manufacturers 
service revenue increased to million in  from million in  when it increased from million in the increases in both and were primarily due to increased sales of service and support contracts on new licenses  renewal of service and support contracts on existing licenses  an increase in demand for consulting and training services and  to a lesser extent in  the acquisition of nsmg in the second quarter of we expect that service revenue will continue to grow as a percentage of our net revenue 
cost of revenue cost of revenue increased to million in from million in  when it increased from million in gross margin on user license fees is substantially higher than gross margin on service revenue  reflecting the low materials  packaging and other costs of software products compared with the relatively high personnel costs associated with providing maintenance  technical support  consulting  training services and development efforts 
cost of service revenue also varies based upon the mix of maintenance  technical support  consulting and training services 
cost of user license fees including amortization of developed technology 
cost of user license fees consists primarily of royalties  media  manuals and distribution costs 
also included in the cost of revenue is the amortization of developed technology acquired in the nsmg  telebackup and nuview acquisitions 
the estimated useful life of the developed technology acquired is four years and we expect the amortization to be approximately million per quarter 
cost of user license fees including amortization of developed technology increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the increase in was primarily the result of the amortization of developed technology  and to a lesser extent  a larger percentage of license fees being generated from the sale of products with higher royalty rates 
we pay royalties for certain technology licensed from others and incorporated in our products 
the increase in was primarily the result of a larger percentage of license fees being generated from the sale of products with higher royalty rates 
gross margin on user license fees decreased to in and remained constant at in and the decrease in gross margin on user license fees in was due to the amortization of developed technology 
if we excluded the amortization of developed technology from the cost of user license fees  the gross margin would have been in the gross margin on user license fees may vary from period to period based on the license revenue mix and certain products having higher royalty rates than other products 
we do not expect gross margin on user license fees to increase 
cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue consists primarily of personnel related costs in providing maintenance  technical support  consulting and training to customers  and development efforts in porting 
cost of service revenue increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in gross margin on service revenue was in  in and in the increase in absolute dollars was due primarily to personnel additions in our customer support  training and consulting organizations  in anticipation of increased demand for such services 
the gross margin improvement in was the result of increased productivity and higher service revenue growth due to support fees from a larger installed customer base 
operating expenses the nsmg and the telebackup acquisitions have contributed to increases in all operating expense categories 
however  due to the integration that has taken place to date  it is not possible to quantify the portion of the increase that is related directly to these acquisitions 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  commissions  consultant fees and other costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively consistent at in  in and in the increase in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to increased sales and marketing staffing and  to a lesser extent  increased costs associated with new marketing programs 
we intend to continue to expand our global sales and marketing infrastructure  and accordingly  we expect our selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars but not necessarily change significantly as a percentage of net revenue in the future 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  third party consultant fees and other engineering related costs 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the increases were due primarily to increased staffing levels associated with new hires and our acquisitions and expansion of development efforts for new technology 
as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses decreased to in from in and in we believe that a significant level of research and development investment is required to remain competitive  and expect these expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods and may increase slightly as a percentage of net revenue 
research and development expenses can be expected to fluctuate from time to time to the extent that we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and our level of revenue fluctuates 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits and fees for professional services  such as legal and accounting services 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were in  in and in the increases in absolute dollars in and were due to additional personnel costs  including additional personnel related to the acquisitions in the second quarter of  and  to a lesser extent  to an increase in the provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts and other expenses associated with enhancing our infrastructure to support expansion of our operations 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars  but not to change significantly as a percentage of net revenue  as we expand our operations 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was million in this amount for the most part represents seven months of amortization of goodwill  distribution channels  trademarks and other intangibles assets recorded upon the acquisitions of nsmg and telebackup and five months of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles assets recorded upon the acquisition of nuview 
the estimated useful life of the goodwill and the other intangibles is four years and we expect the amortization to be approximately million per quarter 
acquisition and restructuring costs 
in  upon the acquisition of nsmg  we recorded a one time charge to acquisition and restructuring costs of million  which included approximately million in exit costs with respect to duplicative facilities that we plan to vacate and approximately million in severance benefits 
acquisition and restructuring costs are summarized below in thousands cash payments or provision non cash charges from accrued as of recorded at acquisition date to december  acquisition date december  cancellation of facility leases and other contracts   involuntary termination benefits  write off of redundant equipment and leasehold improvements of the accrued balance as of december   million relates to servicing operating lease payments or negotiated buyout of operating lease commitments on duplicative facilities  the lease terms of which will expire at various times through the year the remaining million is expected to be utilized by may in  as a result of the openvision merger  we incurred charges of million  consisting of approximately million for transaction fees and professional services  million for contract terminations and asset write offs and million for other costs incident to the openvision merger 
of the total charge  million resulted from the write down of redundant assets and facilities  primarily consisting of intangible assets related to a prior acquisition which were redundant as a result of openvision having a similar product line 
the remaining million  involving banking  legal and accounting fees and other direct costs in connection with the elimination of duplicative facilities  was fully paid as of december  in process research and development 
in process research and development was million in this amount represents one time charges of million recorded upon the acquisition of nsmg in may  million recorded upon the acquisition of telebackup in june and million recorded upon the acquisition of certain assets of nuview in august we obtained outside valuations for these acquisitions  and values were assigned to developed technology  in process research and development and other intangibles 
the fair value of the in process research and development for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 
each project was analyzed to determine the characteristics and applications of the technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development efforts  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of completion 
the projected future cash flows from the projects under development were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects 
revenues on the projects related to in process research and development were estimated to begin in through  with the majority of the revenues occurring between and the risk adjusted discount rate applied to after tax cash flows was  compared to an estimated weighted average cost of capital of 
we believe the amounts determined for in process research and development are representative of fair value and do not exceed the amounts an independent third party would pay for the projects assumed 
the total charge for in process research and technology was estimated to be million  for the nsmg acquisition  completed in may seven in process research and development projects were identified and valued  with two projects under the data protection product group that accounted for approximately of the value assigned to in process research and development 
the data protection software products provide backup and restore functions  including scheduled automated unattended data backup operations 
the remaining products identified and valued were under the application solutions and replication product groups 
the application solutions software provides scaleable solution for managing the behavior of different types of networks worldwide from one central location and the replication software products deliver flexible and intelligent data replication for windows nt environments 
costs to complete all of the nsmg in process research and development projects were estimated to be million 
at the date of acquisition  the development of all products ranged from to complete and averaged approximately complete  with expected completion dates through december at december   the completion and release of some products have been delayed through may we do not expect the delays to have any significant impacts on our return on investments  results of operations or financial position 
at december   we estimate approximately million to complete the development of the in process research and development projects acquired from nsmg 
all in process research and development projects related to the telebackup and nuview acquisitions were individually insignificant and were completed or abandoned as of december  interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net increased to million in from million in  and million in the increases were due primarily to increased amounts of interest income attributable to the higher level of funds available for investment  primarily from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes in october and august and  to a lesser extent  from the net cash provided by operating activities 
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses that are included in other income  net  have not had a significant effect on our results of operations 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in  and million in interest expense in  and consists primarily of interest accrued under the convertible subordinated notes due issued in august and the convertible subordinated notes due issued in october income taxes 
we had effective tax rates of negative in  positive in and positive in our effective tax rate was negative and differed from the combined federal and state statutory rates primarily due to acquisition related charges that were non deductible for tax purposes 
our and effective tax rates were lower than the combined federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the utilization of federal net operating loss carryforwards  other credit carryforwards and reduction of the valuation allowance on deferred income taxes  offset by the impact of state and foreign taxes 
new accounting pronouncements 
in december  the aicpa issued sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
sop amends sop software revenue recognition to require recognition of revenue using the residual method when certain criteria are met 
we will be required to implement these provisions of sop for our fiscal year ending december  sop also amends sop  an earlier amendment to sop  which extended the deferral of the application of certain passages of sop we do not believe the impact of sop will be material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
we will be required to implement sfas no 
as of the beginning of our fiscal year our foreign currency exchange rate hedging activities have been insignificant to date and we do not believe that the impact of sfas no 
will be material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december  and represented of our net tangible assets 
cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid with original maturities of ninety days or less 
short term investments consist mainly of investment grade commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities and market auction preferreds 
at december   we had million of long term obligations and stockholders equity was approximately  million 
net cash provided from operating activities was million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from income after adjustments to exclude non cash charges  including amortization of intangibles related to acquisition activities  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  as a result of our overall revenue growth 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income and increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue balances  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses  reflecting our overall growth 
our investing activities used cash of million in primarily due to the net increase in short term and long term investments of million  purchases of property and equipment of million and purchase of certain assets of nuview 
our investing activities used cash of million in primarily due to capital expenditures of million 
our investing activities used cash of million in primarily due to the net increase of short term investments of million  and capital expenditures of million 
financing activities provided cash of million in from the net proceeds of million related to the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes in august and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 
financing activities provided cash of million in  arising from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 
financing activities provided cash of million in  primarily from the net proceeds of million related to the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes in october and issuance of common stock of million under our employee stock plans 
in october  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due the notes  for which we received net proceeds of million 
we and our wholly owned subsidiary  veritas operating corporation  are co obligors on the notes 
the notes provide for semi annual interest payments of million each may and november the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events  equivalent to a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount at maturity 
on or after november   the notes will be redeemable over a period of time until maturity at our option at declining premiums to par 
the debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the notes using the interest method 
in august  we and our wholly owned subsidiary  veritas operating corporation  issued million  aggregate principal amount at maturity  of convertible subordinated notes due the notes for which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
the interest rate of together with the accrual of original issue discount represent a yield to maturity of 
veritas and veritas operating corporation are co obligors on the notes 
the notes provide for semi annual interest payments of million each february and august  commencing february  the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events  equivalent to an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount at maturity 
on or after august   the notes will be redeemable over a period of time until maturity at our option at the issuance price plus accrued original issue discount and any accrued interest 
the debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the notes using the interest method 
we expect to use the net proceeds from these notes issuance for general corporate purposes  including working capital expenditures and possible acquisitions of companies or technology  although there are no current agreements or negotiations pending with respect to any material acquisitions 
pending these uses  we intend to invest the net proceeds in short term interest bearing  investment grade securities 
following the issuance of the notes  we have a ratio of long term debt to total capitalization at december  of approximately 
as a result of this additional indebtedness  our principal and interest payment obligations increased substantially 
the degree to which we will be leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  including the notes and the notes  future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements 
if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of cash flow from operations  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain alternative financing 
during the first quarter of  we amended and revised our existing lease agreement for new corporate campus facilities in mountain view  california 
these facilities will replace certain facilities we currently lease in mountain view 
the new corporate campus facilities will be developed in one phase for a total of  square feet and will provide space for sales  marketing  administration and research and development functions 
the lease term for these facilities is five years beginning in march  with an option to extend the lease term for two successive periods of one year each 
we have an option to purchase the property land and facilities for million or  at the end of the lease  to arrange for the sale of the property to a third party with us retaining an obligation to the owner for the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value up to million if the sales price is less than this amount  subject to certain provisions of the lease 
we anticipate occupying the new corporate campus facilities and beginning the lease payments in the second quarter of the lease agreement requires us to maintain specified financial covenants such as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  debt on ebitda and quick ratio  all of which we were in compliance with as of december  during the first quarter of  we signed a lease agreement for our existing facilities in roseville  minnesota 
we will improve and expand our existing facilities of approximately  square feet and will develop adjacent property adding approximately  square feet to the campus  with the first phase of approximately  square feet being completed in the second quarter of the facilities will provide space for research and development functions 
the lease term for these facilities is five years beginning in march  with an option to extend the lease term for two successive periods of one year each 
we have an option to purchase the property land and facilities for million or  at the end of the lease  to arrange for the sale of the property to a third party with us retaining an obligation to the owner for the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value up to million if the sales price is less than this amount  subject to certain provisions of the lease 
we anticipate occupying the new corporate campus facilities and beginning the lease payments in the second quarter of we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
after that time  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available at all or that if available  we will be able to obtain it on terms favorable to us 
recent developments on march   veritas  seagate technology  inc and an investor group including seagate technology s management group announced a transaction in which we will acquire all of the shares of our common stock held by seagate technology  certain other securities and cash 
we are not acquiring seagate technology s disc drive business or any other seagate technology operating business 
in the transaction  we will issue to the seagate technology stockholders approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million shares of veritas common stock held by seagate technology 
in addition  we will issue shares of our common stock for certain other securities held by seagate technology at the closing date and  at our election  we may also issue shares of our common stock for up to million in retained cash at the closing date 
we will be indemnified for liabilities  including tax liabilities and other matters that may arise in connection with the transaction 
the transaction is intended to qualify as a tax free reorganization 
for a detailed discussion of the transaction and the related risks  please refer to our form k that will be filed with the sec on or about april   as well as the joint proxy statement prospectus to be filed by both seagate technology and us in connection with the transaction 
year compliance some currently installed computer systems and software products are unable to distinguish between twentieth century dates and twenty first century dates because such systems may have been developed using two digits rather than four to determine the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year as a result  some companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced to comply with these year requirements 
we believe our software products and services are year ready that is  they are capable of adequately distinguishing twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates 
new products are being designed and tested to be year ready 
although our products have undergone  or will undergo  our normal quality testing procedures  there can  however  be no assurance that our products will contain all necessary date code changes 
furthermore  use of our products in connection with other products that are not year ready  including non compliant hardware  software and firmware  may result in the inaccurate exchange of dates and result in performance problems or system failure 
in addition  original equipment manufacturer derivative versions of our older products may not be year ready 
to date  we have received no complaints regarding material year compliance of our products 
although we have not been a party to any litigation or arbitration proceeding to date that involves year compliance issues with our products or services  there can be no assurance that we will not in the future be required to defend our products or services in such proceedings  or to negotiate resolutions of claims based on year issues 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  regardless of the merits of such disputes  and any liability we have for year related damages  including consequential damages  could harm on our business 
to date  we have not encountered any material problems in this regard with our computer systems or any other equipment that might be subject to such problems 
factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating veritas and our business 
we face many new difficulties managing a larger company the nsmg and telebackup acquisitions have created new challenges for us 
if we fail to meet those challenges  our business and quarterly and annual results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of your investment could decline 
we grew rapidly before the nsmg and telebackup acquisitions 
after these acquisitions  our workforce was approximately twice the size of our workforce prior to the acquisitions 
this growth is likely to strain our management control systems and resources  including decision support  accounting  management information systems and facilities 
we must continue to improve our financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures to manage our employees and to obtain additional facilities 
we might fail to integrate the businesses of veritas  nsmg and telebackup product line integration will be difficult 
we must integrate the independent businesses of nsmg and telebackup with our own 
if we fail to integrate them  our business and our quarterly and annual results of operations may be adversely affected 
one key issue will be the integration of our products with those of nsmg and telebackup 
this product line integration will involve consolidating products with duplicative functionality  coordinating research and development activities  and converging the technologies supporting the various products 
for example  the veritas netbackup product and veritas backup exec products share many features and functions 
technology convergence will be particularly difficult because our products lack a common technology architecture 
in particular  products formerly associated with nsmg were not designed for the degree of scalability that our legacy products were designed for  nor for use on a variety of operating systems 
other business integration issues  if not satisfactorily resolved  could have a material negative impact on our business 
other problems inherent in integrating our businesses include maintaining brand recognition for key products formerly associated with nsmg  such as veritas backup exec  and with telebackup  such as veritas telebackup  while migrating customer identification of these brands to veritas  resolving channel conflicts that may arise between our original equipment manufacturer and direct sales channels and the retail channels acquired in the nsmg acquisition  coordinating  integrating and streamlining geographically dispersed operations  such as engineering facilities in california  minnesota  florida  north carolina  maryland  colorado  massachusetts  washington  canada and india  and coping with customers uncertainty about continued support for duplicative products 
the integration will be expensive and is likely to interrupt our ordinary business activities 
any of these risks could harm our business and quarterly and annual results of operations 
management and employee integration issues  if not satisfactorily resolved  could harm our business 
potential management and employee integration problems include resolving differences between the corporate cultures of veritas  nsmg and telebackup  and integrating the management teams of all three companies successfully 
we will incur significant accounting charges in connection with the nsmg  telebackup and nuview acquisitions that will reduce our earnings immediately and in the future the significant costs of integration associated with the nsmg  telebackup and nuview acquisitions increase the risk that we will not realize the anticipated benefits 
because we accounted for these acquisitions using purchase method of accounting  we recorded non cash charges of million in our statements of operations in  related to the write off of in process research and development 
we also recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately  million 
this amount will be amortized over four years  and will result in charges to operations of approximately million per quarter 
we also recorded a restructuring charge in of million related primarily to costs for our duplicative facilities that we plan to vacate 
these costs are in addition to the liability for the estimated costs to vacate duplicative facilities of the nsmg business 
we have a significant amount of debt that we may be unable to service or repay in october  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in august  we issued million aggregate principal amount at maturity of convertible subordinated notes due the annual interest payments on our outstanding notes as of december  are million and million respectively  which we expect to fund from cash flow from operations 
we will need to generate substantial amounts of cash from our operations to fund interest payments and to repay the principal amount of debt when it matures  while at the same time funding capital expenditures and our other working capital needs 
if we do not have sufficient cash to repay our debts as they become due  we may be unable to refinance our debt on reasonable terms or at all 
for example  the notes could be declared immediately due and payable if we do not make timely payments 
while our cash flow has been sufficient to fund interest payments to date  if we cannot meet our debt obligations from the cash generated by our business  we may not be able to develop and sell new products  respond to changing business or economic conditions adequately  make acquisitions or otherwise fund our business 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of factors outside our control  which could cause the market price of our notes and of our securities to decline fluctuations in our results of operations are likely to affect the market price of our common stock and subordinated notes in a manner that may be unrelated to our long term operating performance 
the more likely it is that market prices of our securities will fluctuate  the riskier is your decision to buy  sell or hold our securities 
in addition  the number of factors that could affect our results of operation makes an investment in our securities riskier than many other investments 
our revenues in any quarter will depend substantially on orders we receive and ship in that quarter 
in addition  we typically receive a significant portion of orders in any quarter during the last two weeks of the quarter  and we cannot predict whether those orders will be placed  fulfilled and shipped in that period 
if we have lower revenue than we expect  we probably will not be able to reduce our operating expenses quickly in response 
therefore  any significant shortfall in revenues or delay of customer orders could have an immediate adverse effect on our operating results in that quarter 
the results of operations of veritas  and of the nsmg and telebackup businesses we recently acquired  have fluctuated in the past  and our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
factors that could affect our results of operations include the timing and magnitude of sales through original equipment manufacturers  the unpredictability of the timing and level of sales to large distributors in the retail channel and our direct sales force  which tend to generate sales later in our quarters than original equipment manufacturer sales  the timing and magnitude of large orders  the timing and amount of our marketing  sales and product development expenses  the introduction  timing and market acceptance of new products  the timing of revenue recognition for sales of software products and services  changes in data storage and networking technology or introduction of new operating system upgrades by original equipment manufacturers  which could require us to modify our products or develop new products  the relative growth rates of the windows nt and unix markets  the rate of adoption of microsoft s release of windows by users  pricing policies and distribution terms  and the timing and magnitude of acquisitions 
we depend on large orders with lengthy sales cycles for a significant portion of our revenues our revenues for a quarter could fluctuate significantly based on whether a large order near the end of a quarter is closed or delayed 
customer orders can range in value from a few thousand to a few million dollars 
the length of time between initial contact with a potential customer and sale of a product  or our sales cycle  outside the retail channel is typically complex and lengthy  so it can last from three to nine months 
these direct sales also represent our largest orders 
therefore  our revenues for a period are likely to be affected by the timing of larger orders  which makes that revenue difficult to predict 
the factors that could delay or defer an order  include time needed for technical evaluations of our software by customers  customer budget restrictions  customer internal review and testing procedures  and engineering work needed to integrate our software with the customers systems 
we may be unable to hire and retain needed sales and engineering personnel our personnel needs are more acute than those facing most companies 
we need to hire additional sales  engineering  service and administrative personnel 
if we are unable to hire and retain these employees  our business and quarterly and annual results of operations would be adversely affected 
competition for people with the skills we require is intense 
additions of new personnel and departures of existing personnel could disrupt our business and may result in the departure of other employees 
we also depend on the continued service of our key personnel 
even though we have entered into employment agreements with key management personnel  these agreements cannot prevent their departure 
we do not have key person life insurance covering any of our personnel  nor do we currently intend to obtain any of this insurance 
we distribute our products through multiple distribution channels  each of which is subject to risks historically  we sold products through original equipment manufacturers and through direct sales 
as a result of the nsmg and telebackup acquisitions  however  we also have a retail distribution channel as well 
if we fail to manage our distribution channels successfully  our business and quarterly and annual results of operations would be adversely affected 
retail distribution 
some of the software products of the former nsmg business are sold primarily in the retail channel 
as a result  we face different challenges than we face in selling most of our other products 
for example the veritas brand does not have the same level of recognition in the retail channel  retail distribution typically involves shorter product life cycles  and the retail channel has higher risks of product returns  higher marketing expenses and less predictable market demand 
moreover  our retail distributors have no obligation to continue selling the products previously sold by nsmg and telebackup and may terminate our relationship at any time 
direct sales 
we also depend on our direct sales force to sell our products 
this involves a number of risks  including longer sales cycles for direct sales  our need to hire  train  retain and motivate our sales force  and the length of time it takes our new sales representatives to become productive 
original equipment manufacturers 
a portion of our revenue is expected to come from original equipment manufacturers that incorporate our storage management software into systems they sell 
we have no control over the shipping dates or volumes of systems the original equipment manufacturers ship and they have no obligation to ship systems incorporating our software 
they also have no obligation to recommend or offer our software products exclusively or at all 
they have no minimum sales requirements and can terminate our relationship at any time 
these original equipment manufacturers also could choose to develop their own storage management products internally and incorporate those products into their systems in lieu of our products 
finally  the original equipment manufacturers that we do business with compete with one another 
to the extent that one of our of original equipment manufacturer customers views the products we have developed for another original equipment manufacturer as competing with its products  it may decide to stop doing business with us  which could harm our business 
development agreements for original equipment manufacturers 
we have important original equipment manufacturer agreements with hewlett packard  sun microsystems  microsoft  dell  seagate technology and compaq computer 
under these agreements we develop lite versions of our products to be included in these original equipment manufacturers systems software and products 
developing products for these original equipment manufacturers causes us to divert significant resources from other activities that are also important to our business 
if these lite versions do not result in substantial revenue  our business could be harmed 
our distribution channels could conflict with one another we have many different distribution channels 
if we cannot use these distribution channels efficiently  our business and quarterly and annual results of operations could be adversely affected 
our original equipment manufacturers  resellers and direct sales force might target similar sales opportunities  which could lead to inefficient allocation of sales resources 
we may also try to sell full versions of the products to customers of the original equipment manufacturers for whom we have developed lite versions of our products 
this would result in us marketing similar products to end users 
these overlapping sales efforts could also harm our relationships with our original equipment manufacturers and other sales channels and result in them being less willing to market our products aggressively 
if our indirect sales decline  we would need to accelerate our investments in alternative distribution channels 
we may not be able to do this in a timely manner  or at all 
our development agreements with microsoft could cause us to lose customers we have important agreements with microsoft under which we develop software for its windows operating system 
microsoft is not obligated under the agreements to include our software in any of its future releases of windows if for any reason our software is not included in the future  we will lose our expected opportunity to market additional products to the windows or windows nt installed customer base  as well as suffer negative publicity 
in addition  we would lose a part of the investment we have made in developing products for inclusion in windows microsoft could develop competing products microsoft can also develop enhancements to and derivative products from our software products that are embedded in windows or windows nt products 
if microsoft develops any enhancements or derivative products  or enhances its own base products with equivalent functionality  microsoft could choose to compete with us 
sales of a small number of product lines make up a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future  we expect to derive a substantial majority of our revenue from a limited number of software products 
if many customers do not purchase these products as a result of competition  technological change or other factors  our revenue would decrease and our business and quarterly and annual results of operations would be adversely affected 
for example  in and we derived approximately and of our of our license revenue from storage management products  including veritas volume manager  veritas file system  veritas netbackup and veritas backup exec from may  also  our veritas netbackup and veritas backup exec products perform some overlapping functions 
customers may select one product over the other  resulting in reduced revenue for the product not selected 
therefore  we may not receive the same aggregate level of revenue from these products as we have received in the past 
our products have relatively short life cycles our software products have a limited life cycle and it is difficult to estimate when they will become obsolete 
this makes it difficult for us to forecast revenue and makes your investment more risky 
if we do not develop and introduce new products before our existing products have completed their lifecycles  we would not be able to sustain our level of sales 
in addition  to succeed  many customers must adopt our new products early in each product s lifecycle 
therefore  if we do not attract sufficient customers early in a product s life  we may not realize the amount of revenue we anticipated for the product 
we cannot be sure that we will continue to be successful in marketing our key products 
we derive significant revenues from only a few customers for and no customer accounted for greater than of our net revenue 
in we derived of our revenue from sales to sun microsystems 
if sun microsystems  or any other significant customer  were to reduce its purchases from us  our revenue and therefore our business would be harmed unless we were to increase sales to other customers substantially 
we do not have a contract with sun microsystems or any other customer that requires the customer to purchase any specified number of software licenses from us 
therefore  we cannot be sure that these customers will continue to purchase our products at current levels 
we face uncertainties porting products to new operating systems and developing new products some of our products operate primarily on the unix computer operating system 
we are currently redesigning  or porting  these products to operate on the windows nt operating system 
we are also developing new products for unix and for windows nt 
telebackup s products operate on the sun solaris version of unix  the windows and windows nt operating systems 
we intend to port the telebackup products to other unix operating systems and subsequent releases of windows nt 
we may not be able to accomplish any of this work quickly or cost effectively 
these activities require substantial capital investment  substantial employee resources and the cooperation of the owners of the operating systems to or for which the products are being ported or developed 
our porting and development work for the windows nt market has required us to hire additional personnel with windows nt expertise and to devote engineering resources to these projects 
we must obtain from operating system owners a source code license to certain portions of the operating system software to port some of our products to or develop products for the operating system 
operating system owners have no obligation to assist in these porting or development efforts 
if they do not grant us a license or if they do not renew our license  we would not be able to expand our product line easily into other areas 
for example  we rely on a source code license from microsoft with respect to our windows nt development projects 
microsoft is under no obligation to renew the source code license  which is subject to annual renewal 
the market for veritas telebackup is unproven veritas telebackup  which is designed to back up data for remote personal computer users  represents new technology that has no proven market 
a market may not develop for this product or similarly unproven products in the future 
this could harm our business because our investment in telebackup  and any additional development and marketing costs  would be lost  and any expected revenue opportunities would not materialize 
we face intense competition on several fronts we face a variety of tough competitors  principal among which are internal development groups within original equipment manufacturers that provide storage management functions to support their systems  other software vendors and hardware companies that offer products with some of our products features  such as controller and disk subsystem manufacturers  hardware and software vendors that offer storage application products  hardware and software vendors that offer high availability and clustering products  and software vendors focused on remote backup technologies and electronic data vaulting services 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical sales  marketing and other resources than we do and could attempt to increase their presence in the storage management market by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with other competitors or business partners 
expanding our international sales depends on economic stability in regions that have been unstable an investment in our securities is riskier than an investment in many other companies because we plan to expand in overseas markets such as asia  russia and latin america that have experienced significant economic turmoil in recent years 
continued turmoil could adversely affect our plans to increase sales in these regions 
economic recession could also affect our ability to maintain or increase sales in these or other regions in the future 
our concern is that recession in these markets could lead to restrictions on government spending imposed by the international monetary fund  customers reduced access to working capital to fund software purchases  and reduced bank lending or other sources of financing for customers and potential customers 
any of these factors could cause foreign customers to reduce their purchase of our products substantially 
our foreign based operations and sales create special problems that could hurt our results an investment in our securities is riskier than an investment in most businesses because we have significant offshore operations  including development facilities  sales personnel and customer support operations 
for example  as of december   we had approximately engineers located in pune  india  performing product development work 
these offshore operations are subject to risks  including potential loss of developed technology through piracy  misappropriation  or more lax laws regarding intellectual property protection  imposition of governmental controls  including trade restrictions  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability  longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries  difficulties in staffing and managing the offshore operations  seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and other countries  and political unrest  particularly in areas in which we have facilities 
in addition  our international sales are denominated in local currency  creating risk of foreign currency translation gains and losses that could harm our quarterly and annual results of operations 
if we generate profits or losses in foreign countries  our effective income tax rate could also be adversely affected 
currency instability in asia and other financial markets may make our products more expensive than products sold by other vendors that are priced in one of the affected currencies 
therefore  customers in these markets may choose not to purchase our products 
our growth strategy is riskier than others because it is based upon acquisitions of other businesses an investment in our securities is riskier than investments in many other companies because we plan to continue to pursue our strategy of growth through acquisition 
we have grown aggressively through acquisitions in the past and expect to pursue acquisitions in the future 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks and challenges  including diversion of management attention  particularly in the case of multiple concurrent acquisitions  integration of the acquired company s operations and employees with an existing business  incorporation of technology into existing product lines  loss of key employees  and presentation of a unified corporate image 
in the past  we have lost certain employees of acquired companies whom we desired to retain 
in some cases  the integration of the operations of acquired companies took longer than we anticipated 
in addition  if the employees of target companies remain geographically apart from our existing staff  we may not realize some or all of the anticipated economies of scale 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange rate sensitivity we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we engage in exchange rate hedging from time to time but this activity has been insignificant to date and we do not hold or issue foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
our international sales are generated primarily through our international sales subsidiaries 
most international revenue outside the united states and canada is collectible in foreign currencies 
since much of our international operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies  which is the foreign subsidiaries functional currency  the impact of exchange rates on net income or loss is relatively less than the impact on revenue 
although our operating and pricing strategies take into account changes in exchange rates over time  our results of operations may be affected significantly in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international subsidiaries purchase licenses for resale from the parent company resulting in intercompany receivables and payables 
these receivables and payables are carried on these foreign subsidiaries books at the historical local currency that existed at the time of the transaction 
these receivables and payables are eliminated for financial statement reporting purposes 
prior to elimination  the amounts carried in foreign currencies are converted to the functional currency at the then current rate or marked to market 
the marked to market process may give rise to currency remeasurement gains and losses 
these gains or losses are recognized on our statement of operations as a component of other income  net 
to date  any such gains or losses have not been material 
we do not believe our total exposure is significant 
interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities and market auction preferreds 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objective 
as of december   approximately of our investment portfolio is composed of investments with original maturities of one year or less and approximately of our investment portfolio matures less than days from the date of purchase 
long term debt of million consists of convertible subordinated notes due of million the notes and convertible subordinated notes due of million the notes 
the interest rate of on the notes together with the accrual of original issue discount represent a yield to maturity of 
the nominal interest rate on these notes is fixed and the notes provide for semi annual interest payments of approximately million each may and november for the notes and approximately million each february and august for the notes 
the notes are convertible into our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  subject to adjustment in certain events 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents  investments and long term debt that may be subject to interest rate risk and the average interest rates as of december  by year of maturity dollars in thousands and fair value thereafter total total total cash equivalents and short term investments fixed rate     average fixed rate variable rate     average variable rate total cash equivalents and short term investments investments     average rate long term investments fixed rate     average fixed rate long term debt fixed rate     average fixed rate
