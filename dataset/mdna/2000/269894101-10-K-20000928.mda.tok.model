impact of inflation general inflation in the economy has driven the operating expenses of many businesses higher  and  accordingly  we have experienced increased salaries and higher prices for supplies  goods and services

impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative is dependent upon the intended use of the derivative 
sfas no 
will be effective in the company s first quarter of the fiscal year ending june  and retroactive application is not permitted 
management does not believe that this statement will have a significant impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the estimated fair value of financial instruments have been determined by the company using available market information and appropriate valuation and methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented here are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments cash and cash equivalents  accounts and notes receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses the carrying amounts of these items are a reasonable estimate of their fair value 
long term debt interest rates that are currently available to the company for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value for bank debt 
the carrying amount comprising this item are reasonable estimates of fair value  except for a note due in october and a note due in june such notes have carrying values of  and  respectively  and estimated fair market values of  and  respectively 
the fair value estimates are based on pertinent information available to management as of june  although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts  such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since that date and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented 
the company has not entered into  and does not expect to enter into  financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes 
the company is currently exposed to material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations since the majority of the company s long term debt obligations are at variable rates 
the company does not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swaps and or similar instruments 
based on the amount outstanding as of june   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate  charge to the company s annual interest expense 
for fixed rate interest rate obligations  changes in market interest rates affect the fair market value of such debt  but do not impact the company s earnings or cash flows
