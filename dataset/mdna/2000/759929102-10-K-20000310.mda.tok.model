item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our balance sheets and statements of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data  the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere therein 
years ended december  and comparison of balance sheets at december  and overview our total assets were billion at december   and billion at december   an increase of million or 
the mix of our asset base changed substantially during the year as we sold a major part of our december inventory of loans held for sale and reinvested those funds into us treasury and mortgage backed securities 
at december   we no longer maintained an inventory of loans held for sale 
in september  we completed a private placement to accredited investors of million of convertible subordinated debentures the debentures 
in addition  we refinanced our million of debt to our directors 
approximately million of the debentures were issued to our directors in exchange for an equal amount of the pre existing debt  with the balance of the debentures being sold to third party accredited investors 
the million balance of the million debt to directors not converted into the debentures was exchanged for an equal principal amount of non convertible term subordinated debt the term debt 
both the debentures and the term debt that we issued qualify as tier capital under applicable regulatory capital guidelines 
we paid down the principal amount of our million non revolving line of credit senior debt from suntrust bank  central florida  na suntrust by million to a balance of million 
the million of net proceeds from sale of the debentures  after deducting offering costs  and the cash received from dissolution of the savings bank  were used to repay principal on the suntrust loan 
in connection with the paydown  suntrust agreed to extend the remaining portion of its loan to the company through march  investment and mortgage backed securities investments consisting of us treasury and federal agency securities  commercial paper  and mortgage backed securities were million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million or  partially as a result of the sale or securitization of loans held for sale 
at december   million of securities were classified as available for sale  million of securities were classified as held to maturity and million were trading assets 
included in the trading asset category were a million subordinate tranche of securities purchased from our securitization of high ltv loans in june  million in overcollateralization and residual interests in cash flows from securitizations in december and june  and the excess spread on mortgage servicing rights  which amounted to million at year end trading assets are evaluated at least quarterly with any valuation adjustment reflected as a trading gain or loss in the statement of operations 
under applicable accounting rules  use of quoted market values is the preferred method for valuing trading assets 
however  where the market for those assets is illiquid and price quotations are available on a distress basis only  other methods are permitted  including techniques utilizing the present value of expected cash flows 
the company has employed those present value methods in lieu of established market price quotes for its trading assets 
in december we conducted an extensive analysis of the credit quality of the loans underlying the trading assets related to high ltv loan securitizations by 
table of contents obtaining current credit scores on the borrowers 
based on that analysis and on the historical loss history of those loans an adjustment was made to the expected cumulative losses on each securitization expressed as total lifetime losses as a percent of the original balance of loans in the securitization 
the cumulative loss factor for the securitization completed in december was increased from an original estimate of to a current estimate of 
the cumulative loss factor for the securitization completed in june was increased from an original estimate of to a current estimate of 
a trading loss of  was recorded based on the revised valuation 
we believe these valuations are a reasonable approximation of fair market value  however  there is no assurance that we could realize these values if such assets were sold in the current market 
loans and loans held for sale total loans including held for portfolio and held for sale were billion at december   compared to billion at december   a decrease of million  or 
loan sales in early and a rapid increase in refinancing of loans beginning in mid were the primary reasons for a million decline in first lien residential loans

senior debt on september   suntrust extended us a non revolving line of credit the senior debt for up to million 
interest on the loan is payable monthly  and the maturity date for the loan was september  on september   we received the full million balance under the line of credit 
the proceeds of the senior debt were used to maintain the regulatory capital of the bank at well capitalized levels and to support the planned branch expansion activities 
the terms of the senior debt were amended on december  to require  among other things  that an interest rate of libor plus  effective january  be paid  we maintain an acceptable

william r 
hough  our chairman of the board and principal shareholder  purchase the loan from suntrust 
on march   the senior debt was further amended to extend the date for suntrust s option to request purchase of the loan from march  to september   the maturity date of the loan 
we agreed to establish an interest reserve account with suntrust and to deposit in the account sufficient funds to pay interest on the loan through the maturity date 
suntrust retained its right to request purchase of the loan in the event we fail to comply with financial convenants of the senior debt which require us to maintain our ratio of nonperforming assets to assets at no more than three percent  maintain our debt service coverage ratio at no less than two to one  and eliminate the excess of dividends paid by the bank to the holding company over the bank s net income for the current and two preceding years by june  in september we paid down the principal amount of the senior debt by million to a balance of million  using the net proceeds from the issuance of subordinated debt and dividends from the bank 
suntrust agreed to extend the remaining portion of its loan to us through march  convertible subordinated debentures in september  the company completed a private placement to accredited investors of million of its convertible subordinated debentures the debentures 
the net proceeds from issuance were used to paydown the company s senior debt 
each  principal amount of the debentures are convertible at any time by the holder into shares of the company s common stock 
the resulting conversion price of per share represented a premium of approximately over the september  closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market 
the debentures are redeemable by the company at any time after october  at a premium of with the premium declining one percent per year thereafter 
the debentures may also be redeemed at our option if the closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds for consecutive trading days

asset liability management and liquidity liquidity the asset liability management committee alco reviews our liquidity  which is our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet the funding needs of current loan demand  deposit withdrawals  and other cash demands 
the primary sources of funds consist of deposits  amortization and prepayments of loans  sales of investments  other funds from operations and our capital 
we are a member of the fhlb and have the ability to borrow to supplement our liquidity needs 
those fhlb borrowings  known as advances  are secured by the bank s mortgage loan portfolio  and the terms and rates charged for fhlb advances vary based on an institution s loan portfolio and in response to general economic conditions 
as a shareholder of the fhlb  the bank is authorized to apply for advances from this bank 
a variety of borrowing plans is offered by the fhlb  each with its own maturity and interest rate 
the fhlb will consider various factors  including an institution s regulatory capital position  net income  quality and composition of assets  lending policies and practices  and level of current borrowings from all sources  in determining the amount of credit to extend to an institution 
as of december   the bank had  of outstanding advances from the fhlb 
see business supervision and regulation federal home loan bank system and liquidity 
at december   the bank s liquidity ratio  defined as net cash and investments of million divided by net deposits and short term liabilities of billion  was as compared to at december  net liquid assets were million in excess of the amount required by florida banking regulations 

table of contents asset liability management one of our primary objectives is to reduce fluctuations in net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
to manage interest rate risk  the board of directors has established interest rate risk policies and procedures  that delegate to alco the responsibility to monitor and report on interest rate risk  devise strategies to manage interest rate risk  monitor loan originations and deposit activity  and approve all pricing strategies 
the management of interest rate risk is one of the most significant factors affecting the ability to achieve future earnings 
the measure of the mismatch of assets maturing or re pricing within certain periods  and liabilities maturing or re pricing within the same period  is commonly referred to as the gap for such period 
controlling the maturity or re pricing of an institution s assets and liabilities in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
negative gap occurs when  during a specific time period  an institution s liabilities are scheduled to re price more rapidly than its assets  so that  barring other factors affecting interest income and expense  in periods of rising interest rates the institution s interest expense would increase more rapidly than its interest income  and in periods of falling interest rates the institution s interest expense would decrease more rapidly than its interest income 
positive gap occurs when an institution s assets are scheduled to re price more rapidly than its liabilities  so that  barring other factors affecting interest income and expense  in periods of falling interest rates the institution s interest income would decrease more rapidly than its interest expense  and in periods of rising interest rates the institution s interest income would increase more rapidly than its interest expense 
it is common to focus on the one year gap  which is the difference between the dollar amount of assets and the dollar amount of liabilities maturing or re pricing within the next months 
alco uses an industry standard computer modeling system to analyze the impact of financial strategies prior to their implementation 
the system attempts to simulate the asset and liability base and project future operating results under a variety of interest rates and spread assumptions 
through this management tool  we can also  among other things  project the effects of changing our asset and liability mix and modifying our balance sheet  and identify appropriate investment opportunities 
the results of these simulations are evaluated within the context of the interest rate risk policy  which sets out target levels for the appropriate level of interest rate risk 
the policy is to maintain a cumulative one year gap of no more than plus or minus of total assets 
we conform to this policy primarily by managing the maturity distribution of our investment portfolio and emphasizing loan originations and loan purchases carrying variable interest rates tied to interest sensitive indices 
additionally  the bank has joined the fhlb to enhance its liquidity position and to provide it with the ability to utilize long term fixed rate advances to improve the match between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in certain periods 
currently  off balance sheet hedging instruments are not used to manage overall interest rate risk 
in  the company discontinued the use of these instruments 
we may expand our use of off balance sheet hedging instruments to manage exposure to overall interest rate risk in the future  subject to board approval 
the cumulative one year gap at december   was a negative million  or a negative expressed as a percentage of total assets 
we will attempt to moderate any lengthening of the re pricing structure of earning assets by emphasizing variable rate assets and  where appropriate  match funding longer term fixed rate loans with fhlb advances 
see business sources of funds 
the following table presents the maturities or re pricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the balances shown have been derived based on the financial characteristics of the various assets and liabilities 
adjustable and floating rate assets are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than their scheduled maturity dates 
fixed rate loans are shown in the periods in which they are scheduled to be repaid according to contractual amortization and  where appropriate  prepayment assumptions  based on the coupon rates in the portfolio have been used to adjust the repayment amounts 
re pricing of time deposits is based on their scheduled maturities 
based on an analysis of our deposit accounts and our experience in the markets in which we operate  statement savings deposits are 
table of contents assumed to re price at of the total balance in the first months  in the second months  in the third and fourth year  and the remaining in the fifth year 
passbook savings deposits are assumed to re price at of the total balance in the first months  in the second months  in the third year  and the remaining in the fourth year 
re pricing of interest checking is assumed to occur at in the first months  in the second months  in the third and fourth year  and the remaining in the fifth year 
the re pricing of regular money market accounts is assumed at of the total balance in the first year  in the second year  in the third and fourth years with the remaining in the fifth year  while money market gold accounts re price at in the first year  in the second year  in the third and fourth years and the remaining in the fifth year
