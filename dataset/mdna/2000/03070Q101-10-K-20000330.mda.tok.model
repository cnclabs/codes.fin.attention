certain of the company s operations are seasonal in nature 
in particular  in jackpot  the months of march through october are the strongest 
as a result  the second and third calendar quarters typically produce a disproportionate amount of the income from operations of the jackpot properties 
in addition  adverse weather conditions may adversely affect the business of the jackpot properties  and operations during the winter months typically vary from year to year based on the severity of the winter weather conditions in the northwestern united states 
to date  operations in council bluffs have experienced some seasonality  with the winter months being the slower periods

year in the past  many computer software programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  date sensitive computer software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this is generally referred to as the year issue 
if this situation were to occur  the potential exists for computer system failures or miscalculations by computer programs  which could disrupt operations 
prior to the rollover to the year  the company evaluated all of its computer systems  including its front and back of the house computer operations  its back of the house accounting systems and its financial software programs  and upgraded these systems as necessary to ensure that  according to the applicable vendors  all of the company s computer systems were year compliant 
the company also made appropriate inquiries of third parties with whom the company does significant business  such as vendors and suppliers  as to their year readiness 
to date  the company has not experienced any significant year problems with its mission critical systems  including those relating to providing service to its guests and monitoring operations  or those of any third parties on which the company depends 
although the company has not experienced any significant year problems to date  it is still possible for year related problems to occur and management therefore plans to continue to monitor the situation closely 
although it is difficult to calculate the costs the company incurred in connection with the year issue  management believes that these costs have not been and are not expected to be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations
