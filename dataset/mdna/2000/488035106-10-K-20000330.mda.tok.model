the company is evaluating the possibility of establishing partnerships with financial leasing organizations for the continued expansion of its aircraft and engine sales and leasing business 
under the proposed initiative  the company expects that it would retain a minority ownership stake in the proposed partnerships and continue to manage the operations of those partnerships 
although there are no guarantees that it will happen  this action  if consummated  could give the company a cash infusion which it expects would be used to pay down a substantial portion of its line of credit with its commercial banks

the company expects that the proposed initiative  if implemented  would have the effect of reducing debt and interest expense  improving cash flow  and freeing up capital for strategic business initiatives

the credit facility bears interest ranging from prime rate plus to basis points  or at the company s option  libor plus to basis points 
the letter of credit component of the million syndicated credit facility was specifically committed to the permanent financing of the company s new world headquarters 
the million financing was completed by the company on february  the company intends to take advantage of growth opportunities that are consistent with the company s expansion and profit objectives 
it is anticipated that such growth opportunities will require the investment of cash into inventories of aircraft and aircraft parts  engines and engine parts and avionics and rotables 
greater availability of such inventories will better enable the company to continue to increase its revenues as well as to encourage the development of strategic relationships with new customers 
the company intends to finance its inventory expansion program through its syndicated credit facility  and through its cash flows 
in the future  the company may require additional sources of capital to continue to fund its expansion 
the company s management believes that free cash flow net income plus depreciation of property  plant and equipment and amortization of goodwill  combined with the company s syndicated credit facility should be sufficient for the company s current level of operations 
however  the company may elect to seek equity capital or other debt financing in the future depending upon market conditions and the capital needs of the company 
year issue the year problem is primarily the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
such programs will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  including possible miscalculations  and a disruption in the operation of such systems 
this is commonly referred to as the year issue 
the company and each of its operating subsidiaries have executed a plan to identify and address any possible business issues related to the impact of the year problem on both its information technology it and non it systems eg  embedded technology 
this plan addressed the year issue in multiple phases  including i determining an initial inventory of the company s systems  equipment including embedded technology in the company s aircraft  engine and parts inventory as well as leased equipment  vendors  customers and third party administrators that may be vulnerable to system failures or processing errors as a result of year issues  ii assessment and prioritization of inventoried items to determine risks associated with their failure to be year compliant  iii testing of systems and equipment to determine year compliance  iv remediation and implementation of systems and equipment  and v contingency planning to assess reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
as part of the company s plan  the company retained a third party year solution provider to assist with a risk analysis of the company s year issue and assist with project office management 
for those systems which the company determined were not year compliant  implementation of the required changes was completed during risk assessment  readiness evaluation  action plans and contingency plans related to the company s suppliers  vendors and other third parties were also completed during incremental costs  which include consulting costs and costs associated with internal resources to modify existing systems in order to achieve year compliance  were charged to expense as incurred 
the company s cost of making the required system changes did not exceed  to date  the company has experienced no significant disruptions in its information technology systems as a result of the year date change 
the company will continue to monitor for undetected year matters that may arise 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
which amended sfas to change the effective date to fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
requires companies to recognize all derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure them at fair value 
management does not anticipate a significant impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is limited primarily to the fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the company s million bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility  which expires in  bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus basis points or  at the company s option  libor plus basis points 
these variable interest rates are subject to interest rate changes in the united states and eurodollar markets 
the company does not currently use  and has not historically used  derivative financial instruments to hedge against such market interest rate risk 
at december   the company had approximately million in variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility  representing approximately of the company s total debt outstanding  at an interest rate of as of december  an increase in interest rates by would not have a material impact on the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows of the company
