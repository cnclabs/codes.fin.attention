item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company was organized in february to invest in commercial mortgage backed securities primarily subordinate securities  commercial mortgage loans  mezzanine investments  equity investments  and other real estate related investments 
substantially all of the million of net proceeds received from the sale of  shares of its class a common stock in june together with the net proceeds of other financing arrangements were used to acquire the company s original portfolio of investments 
the following discussion of the company s financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources and liquidity should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
market conditions the year was a relatively stable year for the company  compared to  which was a difficult year 
in  following the initial public offering of the common stock on june  the company immediately deployed its capital through a series of investments in cmbs  a commercial whole loan and a mezzanine investment 
in september and october  the dislocation of global fixed income markets and the restructuring of several competitors led to extensive spread widening in cmbs and other fixed income markets as well as a rally in the market for government securities 
the price of a fixed income security such as a cmbs or a commercial loan is often determined by adding an interest rate spread to a benchmark interest rate  such as the us treasury rate 
as the spread on a security tightens or decreases  the price or value of the security rises 
at the same time  liquidity in the cmbs market diminished significantly  with much of the diminution occurring in the month of september 
this lack of liquidity continued through the end of the year 
in october and november  the company disposed of classes of cmbs to reduce leverage and the company s exposure to continued spread widening 
the sale of these securities resulted in realized losses of approximately million 
in conjunction with the sale of the cmbs  the company closed related short positions in us government securities 
the closing of these positions resulted in realized losses of approximately million 
the month of december offered some small signs of improvement in the cmbs market as limited liquidity returned  primarily for investments in investment grade securities 
the improvement in the cmbs market continued in as new issues returned to the market  the secondary market continued to recover and spreads on subordinate cmbs tightened slightly 
while spreads on the subordinate classes of cmbs tightened a little during the year  interest rates increased 
the ten year u 
s treasury rate rose approximately basis points in in the same way that a widening increasing spread for cmbs causes their value to fall  increasing interest rates also causes their value to decline 
in order to offset this potential loss in cmbs and commercial loan value due to increasing interest rates  the company sells short us treasury securities that increase in value as interest rates rise 
during the year ended december   the company s short positions in us treasury securities effectively offset the decline in value of the company s cmbs positions due to the increase in interest rates 
results of operations general net income loss for the year ended december  and for the period june  commencement of operations to december  amounted to million or per share and million or per share  respectively 
the income for the year ended december  consisted primarily of income from investments of million and gains from the short positions in government securities of million 
this was offset by losses on cmbs of million  loss on the sale of the commercial mortgage loan of million and interest expense of million 
the net loss for the period june  commencement of operations to december  was attributable primarily to realized and unrealized losses on cmbs of million  loss from the short positions in government securities of million and interest expense of million

the company s primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of repurchase agreements and maturities and principal payments on securities and loans  and proceeds from sales thereof 
in  the company sold classes of cmbs for million and the commercial mortgage loan for million 
it used the proceeds to reduce its exposure to short term repurchase agreement financing on the subordinate classes of cmbs in its portfolio 
in  the tightening of credit markets and the widening of yield spreads on cmbs in the third and fourth quarters adversely affected the liquidity position of the company 
while the company met all obligations under its financing agreements  it was required to post additional collateral in order to meet margin calls from its lenders 
in addition  in october and november  the company sold classes of cmbs for million in order to improve its liquidity 
the proceeds from the sales of cmbs were used by the company to reduce its borrowings under repurchase agreements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  changes in spreads on cmbs  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks to which the investments of the company are exposed are interest rate risk and cmbs spread risk  which are highly sensitive to many factors  including market financing levels  market supply and demand  governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect the net interest income of the company 
the following table demonstrates the estimated effect that changes in interest rates would have on the operating performance of the company and the value of the company s investments in cmbs and short positions in government securities 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected income and portfolio value if no change in interest rates were to occur 
the company s analysis of risks is based on management s experience  estimates and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models of financial information  which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by the manager may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in the company s models and the projected results shown in the following tables and in this report 
table percentage change in expected income and portfolio value at december  and  from changes in interest rates basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points no change basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points income includes expected interest income from cmbs  amortization of market discount on cmbs  net interest income on short positions in government securities and mark to market adjustments to cmbs and government securities from changes in interest rates 
portfolio value includes fair value estimate of cmbs and net short position in government securities 
the company is further exposed to interest rate risk through its short term financing through repurchase agreements at rates that are based on day libor 
the repurchase agreements into which the company has entered are for terms of less than  or equal to days 
changes in interest rates may increase the company s cost of financing its investments 
the following table demonstrates the estimated effect that changes in interest rates would have on the interest expense of the company  based on borrowings outstanding at december  and table percentage change in interest expense under repurchase agreements from changes in libor change in change in change in libor interest expense interest expense basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points no change in libor basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points the investments of the company are also exposed to spread risk 
the price of a fixed income security is generally determined by adding an interest rate spread to a benchmark interest rate  such as the us treasury rate 
as the spread on a security widens or increases  the price or value of the security falls 
as spreads on cmbs widen  the fair value of the company s portfolio falls 
spread widening in the market for cmbs can occur as a result of market concerns over the stability of the commercial real estate market  excess supply of cmbs  or general credit concerns in other markets 
the following table demonstrates the estimated effect that changes in cmbs spreads would have on the value of the company s cmbs portfolio at december  and table percentage change in cmbs portfolio value from changes in cmbs spreads december  december  change in change in cmbs portfolio cmbs portfolio change in cmbs spreads value value basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points no change in cmbs spreads basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points the company enters into contracts to sell securities that it does not own at the time of the sale  at a specified price at a specified time short sales 
the company utilizes these contracts as a means of mitigating hedging the potential financial statement impact of changes in the fair value of its portfolio of cmbs due to changes in interest rates 
as the value of the company s cmbs declines increases with increases decreases in interest rates  the value of the contract increases decreases 
there can be no guarantee  however  that the change in value of the contract will completely offset the change in value of the fixed rate interest earning asset 
these contracts involve the short sale of us treasury securities 
risks in these contracts arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values and interest rates 
if the market value of the securities involved in the short sale increases  the company may be required to meet a margin call 
in the future the company may utilize alternative methods of hedging such as interest swaps or futures contracts 
there is no guarantee that these methods will be successful in hedging the value of the company s portfolio and in addition these methods may increase the cost of hedging 
at december  and  the company had open contracts to sell us treasury securities with face amounts totaling million million  respectively 
although the company generally does not settle these contracts at expiration  but instead rolls them over into new contracts  if the company had settled its open contracts at december  and  the counterparty would have been required to pay the company  and  respectively
