item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general emmis the company evaluates performance of its operating entities based on broadcast cash flow bcf and publishing cash flow pcf 
management believes that bcf and pcf are useful because they provide a meaningful comparison of operating performance between companies in the industry and serve as an indicator of the market value of a group of stations or publishing entities 
bcf and pcf are generally recognized by the broadcast and publishing industries as a measure of performance and are used by analysts who report on the performance of broadcasting and publishing groups 
bcf and pcf do not take into account emmis debt service requirements and other commitments and  accordingly  bcf and pcf are not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available for dividends  reinvestment in emmis business or other discretionary uses 
bcf and pcf are not measures of liquidity or of performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles 
moreover  bcf and pcf are not standardized measures and may be calculated in a number of ways 
emmis defines bcf and pcf as revenues net of agency commissions and operating expenses 
the primary source of broadcast advertising revenues is the sale of advertising time to local and national advertisers 
publishing entities derive revenue from subscriptions and sale of print advertising 
the most significant broadcast operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  costs associated with programming  advertising and promotion  and station general and administrative costs 
significant publishing operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  costs associated with producing the magazine  and general and administrative costs 
the company s revenues are affected primarily by the advertising rates its entities charge 
these rates are in large part based on the entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers 
broadcast entities ratings are measured principally four times a year by arbitron radio market reports for radio stations and by ac nielsen company for television stations 
because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  the company s strategy is to use market research and advertising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services which can be used by the station in its business operations 
the company generally confines the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which the company would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is the company s general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of emmis due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
emmis is exposed to market risk from changes in domestic and international interest rates ie prime and libor and foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage this exposure emmis periodically enters into interest rate derivative agreements 
emmis does not use financial instruments for trading and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
in june  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 and is effective for years beginning after june  this pronouncement  which emmis plans to adopt in its fiscal year ending february   will require  among other things  the company to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives not qualifying as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in its fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through income or recognized in other comprehensive income 
hedge ineffectiveness  the amount by which the change in the value of a hedge does not exactly offset the change in the value of the hedged item  will be immediately recognized in earnings 
management believes adoption of this statement will not materially impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
interest rates although no balance existed as of february   future outstanding balances under the company s credit facility will bear interest at variable rates 
the credit facility requires emmis to maintain interest rate protection agreements through july the notional amount required varies based upon emmis ratio of adjusted debt to ebitda  as defined in the credit facility 
foreign currency emmis owns a interest in a hungarian subsidiary which is consolidated in the accompanying financial statements 
this subsidiary s operations are measured in its local currency 
emmis has a natural hedge since some of the subsidiary s long term obligations are denominated in hungarian forints 
emmis maintains no other derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to the hungarian forint would not be material 
emmis owns a interest in an argentinean subsidiary which is consolidated in the accompanying financial statements 
this subsidiary s operations are measured in its local currency peso  which is tied to the us dollar through the argentine government s convertibility plan 
emmis maintains no derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
