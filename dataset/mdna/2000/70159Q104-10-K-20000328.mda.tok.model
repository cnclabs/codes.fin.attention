funds from operations 
management believes that funds from operations ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity reits 
funds from operations is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income or loss  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in march  nareit issued a clarification of the definition of ffo 
the clarification provides that amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets are not to be added back to net income to arrive at ffo 
in addition  effective january   nareit has clarified that ffo should include both recurring and non recurring operating results except those defined as extraordinary items under generally accepted accounting principles and gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property 
the company s calculation of ffo is consistent with nareit s recent clarification and restatement will not be necessary 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not an indication of cash available to fund cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the following table presents the company s ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december net income   adjustments to derive funds from operations depreciation and amortization   equity in earnings distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries preferred dividends   gain on real estate and other assets  amortization of discounts  deferred gains and other funds from operations   nareit has recommended supplemental disclosure concerning certain capital expenditures  leasing costs and straight line rents as shown below in thousands year ended december straight line rents  amortization of restricted stock grants building improvements   tenant improvements new leases   lease renewals   leasing commissions new leases lease renewals   leasing commissions amortized upgrades on acquisitions anticipated at the date of purchase   inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company s leases typically have three to five year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base rent if rents on the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
impact of year in august  the company adopted a comprehensive uniform plan to address the issue of year compliance 
the year issue was the result of computer programs and embedded chips using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
such computer systems may have been unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could have caused a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
the company s plan addressed problems that might arise in information technology systems  building systems that rely upon the date sensitive microprocessors  and third party tenants  manufacturers  vendors and suppliers 
the plan was a multi phase process where the systems were inventoried  identified and tested for year compliance 
testing included  but was not limited to  central accounting and operating systems  building systems  and tenant and vendor compliance 
any systems found not to be year compliant were upgraded as necessary 
contingency plans were prepared in the event of year failures associated with any company systems 
the company s plan was completed on schedule in the fourth quarter of the cost of the year compliance effort was not material to the company s financial position 
approximately  was incurred to modify  upgrade and or replace non compliant systems 
of the total amount incurred  approximately  would have been expended irrespective of the year issue 
we experienced no system failures or computer errors associated with year compliance 
we have concluded the year plan and anticipate no further year compliance issues or expenditures
