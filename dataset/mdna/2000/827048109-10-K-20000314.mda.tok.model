item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist in an understanding of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december  the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis 
general the company is a leading north american manufacturer of consumer goods packaging products that currently produces i steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food  ii custom designed plastic containers for personal care  health  food  pharmaceutical and household detergent and chemical products and iii specialty packaging items used in the food and beverage industries  including steel caps and closures  aluminum roll on closures  plastic bowls  plastic cans and paperboard containers 
the company is the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in north america  with a unit sale market share for the year ended december  of in the united states  a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in north america for personal care products and a major supplier of metal closures for food and beverage products 
see business general 
revenue growth the company s strategy is to increase shareholder value by growing its existing businesses and expanding into other segments by applying its expertise in acquiring  financing  integrating and efficiently operating consumer goods packaging businesses 
the company has increased its revenues and market share in the metal food container  plastic container and specialty packaging markets through acquisitions and internal growth 
as a result of this strategy  the company has diversified its customer base  geographic presence and product line 
for example  during the past twelve years  the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations 
the company s acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of nestle  dial  del monte  agrilink and  most recently  campbell reflect this trend 
during this period  the company s overall share of the us metal food container market more than quadrupled  from approximately in to approximately in see business general growth strategy 
the company s plastic container business has also increased its market position from a sales base of million in to million in through strategic acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  through internal growth 
the plastic container segment of the consumer goods packaging industry is highly fragmented  and management intends to pursue consolidation opportunities in that segment 
see business general growth strategy 
management believes that it can successfully apply its acquisition and operating expertise to new segments of the consumer goods packaging industry 
although no assurance can be given that the company will be able to locate or acquire attractive acquisition candidates on acceptable terms  management believes that certain trends in and characteristics of the consumer goods packaging industry will generate attractive acquisition opportunities in complementary business lines 
importantly  the industry is fragmented  with numerous segments and multiple participants in the various segments 
additionally  many of these segments are experiencing consolidation 
see business general growth strategy 
operating strategy the company seeks to acquire businesses at reasonable cash flow multiples and to enhance profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
the additional sales and production capacity provided through acquisitions have enabled the company to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings 
in addition  the company s acquisitions have enabled it to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling and minimizing product transportation costs 
the company has also benefited from the economies of its increased purchasing volume and from the elimination of redundant selling and administrative functions  as well as from the investment of capital to upgrade the acquired facilities 
see business general growth strategy enhance profitability of acquired companies 
historically  the company has been able to improve its operating margins through productivity and cost reduction opportunities provided by its acquisitions 
following an acquisition  the company initiates a systematic program  which usually is implemented over a number of years  to optimize its manufacturing facilities 
as a result  this improvement to operating margins generally has been realized over a number of years 
see capital resources and liquidity 
in addition to the benefits realized through the integration of acquired businesses  the company has improved the operating performance of its existing plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reductions 
over the past five years  the company has made million in capital investments to improve its productivity  to reduce its manufacturing costs and to invest in new market opportunities 
for the period from through  the company s operating margins without giving effect to rationalization charges improved over  from in to in  principally as a result of the benefits realized from its rationalization and integration activities since its an can acquisition in and from the investment of capital for productivity improvements 
this improvement was achieved despite the recent impact of lower margin sales to campbell  price reductions under recently extended long term supply agreements and competitive pricing pressure  all of which reduced the company s operating margins in the company operates in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure 
further  the multi year supply arrangements entered into by the company s metal food container business with many of its customers  including nestle  del monte  campbell and several other major food producers  limit the company s ability to increase its margins 
the company estimates that approximately of its projected metal food container sales in will be pursuant to such arrangements 
these multi year supply arrangements generally provide  however  for the pass through of material and labor cost changes  thereby significantly reducing the exposure of the company s results of operations to the volatility of these costs 
see business raw materials 
historically  the company has been successful in continuing its multi year supply arrangements with its customers  without any resulting material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the future the company will retain these multi year supply arrangements or  if the company continues these arrangements  that they will be continued without any material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
recently  the company and nestle agreed to extend the term of the nestle supply agreements for approximately half of the metal containers sales thereunder by seven years from through  in return for certain price reductions which will take effect in the company believes that these price reductions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
see business sales and marketing 
the company s metal food container business sales and  to a lesser extent  operating income are dependent  in part  upon the vegetable  tomato and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the united states 
the size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year  depending in large part upon the weather conditions in those regions 
because of the seasonality of the harvests  the company has historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the second and third quarters of its fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of its annual income from operations during these quarters 
the company believes that this seasonal impact will be mitigated somewhat by the acquisition of cs can 
management believes that sales to campbell generally will be highest in the first and fourth quarters due to the seasonal demand for soup products 
financial strategy the company s financial strategy is to use leverage to support its growth and increase shareholder returns 
the company s stable and predictable cash flow  generated largely as a result of its long term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business  supports its financial strategy 
in  the company reduced its total debt by million to million from million in the company achieved this reduction as a result of a increase in its adjusted ebitda in as compared to and because it did not complete any acquisition and did not incur additional acquisition related indebtedness in the company achieved this debt reduction in despite higher capital expenditures and interest expense in as compared to and the incurrence of million of indebtedness in for common stock repurchases 
as a result of this debt reduction and the company s increased adjusted ebitda  the company s ratios of adjusted ebitda to interest expense and total debt to adjusted ebitda continued to improve in as compared to the company s ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense has increased to in from in  while the company s ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda has improved to in from in unless the company incurs additional indebtedness in to finance acquisitions  the company expects to further reduce its total debt in as compared to pursuant to the indenture relating to the exchange debentures  the company is permitted to redeem all or any of the exchange debentures beginning july  see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the company is considering redeeming all of its outstanding exchange debentures million principal amount in accordance with their terms in the third quarter of  using lower cost revolving loans from its us senior secured credit facility to fund this redemption 
during and  the company used million of its revolving loan facilities to finance its acquisitions and to repurchase approximately million of its common stock 
even though the company incurred such additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions and common stock repurchases  the company s aggregate financing costs interest expense and preferred stock dividend requirements in declined approximately million from  reflecting the benefits of the company s reduction of its debt in and the company s refinancings 
see capital resources and liquidity 
in  the company refinanced substantially all of its indebtedness with lower cost indebtedness and equity to further improve its cash flow and operating and financial flexibility 
in addition to reducing the company s borrowing costs and extending the maturities of its debt  the company s refinancings improved its operating and financial flexibility  including its ability to engage in mergers and acquisitions  make capital expenditures  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  repurchase stock and refinance existing indebtedness 
furthermore  the company s secured credit facilities provide it with revolving loan facilities of million  which are available to the company to provide for seasonal working capital needs and to pursue its growth strategy or for other permitted purposes 
see capital resources and liquidity 
to the extent the company utilizes its revolving loan facilities for acquisitions  stock repurchases or other permitted purposes in future periods  its interest expense may increase 
further  since the company s revolving loan and term loan borrowings under its secured credit facilities bear interest at floating rates  it is sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest and  accordingly  its interest expense may vary from period to period 
after taking into account interest rate swap arrangements that the company entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations  at december  the company had million of indebtedness which bore interest at floating rates 
see effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations and quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
in light of the company s strategy to use leverage to support its growth and optimize shareholder returns  the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant interest expense 
for  the company s aggregate financing costs were of its income from operations without giving effect to rationalization charges as compared to  and for  and  respectively without giving effect to the non cash stock option charge in 
due to the company s significant interest expense  events such as price reductions given to customers in exchange for term extensions or other modifications to existing supply arrangements that are not material to the company s income from operations could have a significant impact on its net income 
the company s board of directors has authorized the repurchase by the company of up to million of its common stock 
in and  the company repurchased million of its common stock  shares and funded such repurchases with revolving loan borrowings from its us bank credit facility 
such repurchases were accretive to the company s earnings per share in and see capital resources and liquidity

historically  the company has met these liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operating activities and revolving loan borrowings 
during  the company refinanced substantially all of its indebtedness with lower cost indebtedness and equity to further improve its cash flow and operating and financial flexibility 
this refinancing culminated in the company entering into a us senior secured credit facility to replace its existing bank facility 
this credit facility provided the company with a total senior secured credit facility of billion  which included million of term loans and a revolving loan facility of million 
revolving loans are available to the company for its working capital and general corporate purposes including acquisitions and stock repurchases 
in addition  the company may request to borrow up to an additional million of revolving loans from one or more of the lenders under the us senior secured credit facility 
the us senior secured credit facility i lowered the interest rates on the company s senior secured borrowings  ii extended the maturities of the company s a term loans and revolving loans thereunder to december  and b term loans thereunder to june   and iii changed certain covenants to further improve the company s operating and financial flexibility  including changes to provide more flexibility to engage in mergers and acquisitions  make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness  pay dividends  repurchase stock  and refinance existing indebtedness 
in december  the company s canadian subsidiaries entered into a secured credit facility to provide the company with more financing flexibility and reduce the company s foreign currency exposure 
the canadian credit facility provided such subsidiaries with approximately million of term loans and up to approximately million of revolving loans 
the term loan proceeds were used to prepay million and million of term loans under the us senior secured credit facility in december and january  respectively 
additionally  as a result of the canadian credit facility  the revolving loan facility under the us senior secured credit facility was reduced by million  the amount of the revolving loan commitment under the canadian credit facility  from million to million 
interest rates for borrowings under the canadian credit facility are generally comparable to interest rates under the us senior secured credit facility 
in  cash generated from operations of million  million of cash balances and million of cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options were used to repay million of borrowings under the company s senior secured credit facilities  fund net capital expenditures of million and repurchase million of holdings common stock

as a result  during the third quarter of  the company recorded a non cash pre tax charge to earnings of million to reduce the carrying value of those assets determined to be surplus or obsolete 
during the fourth quarter of  the company announced its plan to close two west coast manufacturing facilities of its metal food container business and as a result recorded a pre tax charge to earnings of million  which includes million for the non cash write down of certain long term assets deemed to be impaired 
these actions were taken as part of the company s operating strategy to rationalize its operations with the objective of maximizing production efficiencies and enhancing profitability 
in  cash generated from operations of million  net borrowings of revolving loans of million under the company s us senior secured credit facility  million of borrowings under the company s canadian credit facility  million of other borrowings related to the acquisition of cs can  million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises  million of proceeds from asset sales  and million of cash balances were used to fund capital expenditures of million  the acquisitions of winn  cs can and clearplass for an aggregate amount of million  the repurchase of common stock for million  and the repayment of million of bank term loans 
during  in implementing its refinancing strategy  the company used proceeds of million from the ipo  proceeds of million from the issuance of the debentures  along with borrowings of million under the previous credit agreement  million of term loans under the new us senior secured credit facility and million of term loans under the canadian credit facility to redeem the remaining principal amount million of the discount debentures  refinance million of term loans under the previous credit agreement  redeem the notes for million million principal amount  repay million of term loans under the us senior secured credit facility  and pay fees and expenses related to such refinancings of million 
for the year ended december   the company used excess proceeds of million realized from the refinancings referred to above and cash provided by operations of million to repay million principal amount of term loans and million of revolving loans under the previous credit agreement  make net capital expenditures of million  fund acquisitions for million  and increase its cash balance by million 
because the company sells metal containers used in fruit and vegetable pack processing  it has seasonal sales 
as is common in the industry  the company must access working capital to build inventory and then carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the end of the summer and fall packing season 
seasonal accounts are generally settled by year end 
due to the company s seasonal requirements  the company incurs short term indebtedness to finance its working capital requirements 
the company utilizes its revolving loan facilities for seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and repurchases of its common stock 
revolving loan borrowings under the us senior secured credit facility will be due and payable on december  as of december   there were million of outstanding revolving loans under the us senior secured credit facility  and  after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  the unused portion of the revolving loan facility under the us senior secured credit facility at such date was million 
for  the company estimates that at its peak it will utilize approximately million of its revolving loan facilities 
as a result  the company estimates that approximately million of its revolving loan facilities is available to it in for acquisitions  repurchases of common stock and other permitted purposes 
in the third quarter of  the company may redeem all of its outstanding exchange debentures million principal amount in accordance with their terms  using lower cost revolving loans from its us senior secured credit facility 
see financial strategy 
the company financed repurchases of its common stock in and with revolving loans from its us senior secured credit facility 
the company s board of directors has authorized the repurchase by the company of up to million of its common stock 
since july  the company has repurchased  shares of its common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the company intends to finance any future repurchases of its common stock with revolving loans from its us senior secured credit facility 
in  the company issued  shares of its common stock from its treasury stock for employee stock option exercises 
in addition to its operating cash needs  the company believes its cash requirements over the next several years without taking into account the effect of future acquisitions or the possible redemption of the exchange debentures will consist primarily of i annual capital expenditures of to million  ii annual principal amortization payments of bank term loans under its senior secured credit facilities beginning in of approximately million  million  million and million  iii expected total expenditures of approximately million over the next few years associated with plant rationalizations  employee severance and workforce reductions and other plant exit costs  iv the company s interest requirements  including interest on revolving loans the principal amount of which will vary depending upon seasonal requirements and acquisitions and bank term loans under its senior secured credit facilities  most of which bear fluctuating rates of interest  the debentures and the exchange debentures for which the company intends to make future interest payments in cash  and v payments of approximately million for federal and state tax liabilities in  which will increase annually thereafter 
since  the company completed three acquisitions in its metal food container business  including an can in august and cs can in june acquisition reserves established in connection with the purchase of an can aggregated million and related to plant exit costs  employee termination and severance which included the elimination of approximately plant  selling and administrative employees  the assumption of certain liabilities and the elimination of selling  general and administrative functions 
although the company has completed its restructuring plan  the timing of cash payments relating to these costs has been dependent upon  among other things  the expiration of binding labor obligations assumed by the company and complexities associated with qualifying different facilities with the us food and drug administration and customer s requirements 
accordingly  cash payments related to these reserves are expected to be made through see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in connection with its acquisitions of cs can  clearplass and winn  the company developed plans to integrate these businesses into its operations  which included rationalizing certain of the acquired plant operations 
pursuant to these plans which were finalized in  the company accrued liabilities of million  of which million related to plant exit costs and other acquisition liabilities and million related to employee severance and relocation costs 
the timing of cash payments relating to these rationalization activities is dependent upon  among other things  the time required to obtain necessary environmental permits and approvals in connection with a consent order with the us environmental protection agency to which the company is subject as a result of its acquisition of cs can and complexities associated with the transfer of the labor force of campbell for cs can to the company 
the company expects that principally all actions under these plans will be completed by the end of see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
management believes that cash generated by operations and funds from the revolving loans available under the company s secured credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s expected operating needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service and tax obligations for the foreseeable future 
the company is also continually evaluating and pursuing acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market  and will likely incur additional indebtedness  including indebtedness under its us revolving loan facility  to finance any such acquisition 
the company s secured credit facilities and the indentures with respect to the debentures and the exchange debentures contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit the company s ability to incur debt  sell assets and engage in certain transactions 
management does not expect these limitations to have a material effect on the company s business or results of operations 
the company is in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in such financing agreements and believes that it will continue to be in compliance during with all such covenants 
year issues since  the company incurred approximately million in connection with its identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts relating to year readiness issues 
to date  the company has not experienced any material disruptions to its businesses or operations as a result of any year issues affecting it or any of its customers  suppliers  banks or others 
the company will continue to monitor its systems for year issues  although it does not expect to incur any additional material costs relating to year issues 
additionally  the company does not believe that its results of operations in  and in particular the fourth quarter of  were materially impacted as a result of any of its customers purchasing additional products from the company during such period in anticipation of the year effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations historically  inflation has not had a material effect on the company  other than to increase its cost of borrowing 
in general  the company has been able to increase the sales prices of its products to reflect any increases in the prices of raw materials 
see business raw materials and sales and marketing 
because the company has indebtedness which bears interest at floating rates  the company s financial results will be sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest 
as of december   the company had million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million bore interest at floating rates  taking into account interest rate swap agreements entered into by the company to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
under these agreements  floating rate interest was exchanged for fixed rates of interest based on the three month libor rate  which rate ranges from to 
the notional amounts of these agreements totaled million  and the agreements mature in depending upon market conditions  the company may enter into additional interest rate swap or hedge agreements with counterparties that  in the company s judgment  have sufficient creditworthiness to hedge its exposure against interest rate volatility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
the company also has limited foreign currency risk associated with its canadian operations 
the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the value of foreign currencies 
interest rate and foreign currency transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet the company s objectives 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on its earnings and cash flow and to lower its overall borrowing cost 
to achieve its objectives  the company regularly evaluates the amount of its variable rate debt as a percentage of its aggregate debt 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations in its variable rate debt through interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements effectively convert interest rate exposure from variable rates to fixed rates of interest without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k outline the principal amounts  interest rates  fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows from these agreements 
see also management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations 
based on the average outstanding amount of variable rate indebtedness of the company in  a one percentage point change in the interest rates for the company s variable rate indebtedness would have impacted the company s interest expense by an aggregate of approximately million  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of the company s interest rate swap agreements during foreign currency exchange rate risk the company does not conduct a significant portion of its manufacturing or sales activity in foreign markets 
presently  the company s only foreign activities are conducted in canada 
the company s reported financial results could be affected  however  by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the markets where it operates 
when the us dollar strengthens against such foreign currencies  the reported us dollar value of local currency operating profits generally decreases  when the us dollar weakens against such foreign currencies  the reported us dollar value of local currency operating profits generally increases 
since the company does not have significant foreign operations  the company does not believe it is necessary to enter into any derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
because the company s canadian subsidiary operates within its local economic environment  the company believes it is appropriate to finance such operation with local currency borrowings 
in determining the amount of such borrowings  the company evaluates the operation s short and long term business plans  tax implications  and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms 
this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event that the canadian currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
furthermore  the company s canadian operating profit is used to repay its local borrowings or is reinvested in canada  and is not expected to be remitted to the company or invested elsewhere 
as a result  it is not necessary for the company to mitigate the economic effects of currency rate fluctuations on its canadian earnings
