item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  general product prices 
federal and state regulations there have been  and continue to be  numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the oil and gas industry that are often changed in response to the current political or economic environment 
compliance with this regulatory burden is often difficult and costly and may carry substantial penalties for noncompliance 
the following are some specific regulations that may affect the company 
the company cannot predict the impact of these or future legislative or regulatory initiatives 
federal regulation of natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation  including transportation rates charged and various other matters  by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the company s gathering systems and mile pipeline in major county  oklahoma have been declared exempt from ferc jurisdiction 
other gathering systems of the company are not subject to regulation 
federal wellhead price controls on all domestic gas were terminated on january  the company cannot predict the impact of government regulation on any natural gas facilities 
in  ferc issued orders nos 
and a  requiring operators of pipelines to unbundle transportation services from sales services and allow customers to pay for only the services they require  regardless of whether the customer purchases gas from such pipelines or from other suppliers 
the united states court of appeals upheld the unbundling provisions and other components of ferc s orders but remanded several issues to ferc for further explanation 
on february   ferc issued order no 
c  addressing the court s concern 
petitions for rehearing on order no 
c were denied on may  ferc s order remains subject to judicial review and may be changed as a result of that review 
although ferc s regulations should generally facilitate the transportation of gas produced from the company s properties and the direct access to end user markets  the impact of these regulations on marketing the company s production or on its gas transportation business cannot be predicted 
the company  however  does not believe that it will be affected any differently than other natural gas producers and marketers with which it competes 
federal regulation of oil sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
the net price received from the sale of these products is affected by market transportation costs 
a significant part of the company s oil production is transported by pipeline 
the energy policy act of required ferc to adopt a simplified ratemaking methodology for interstate oil pipelines 
in and  ferc issued orders nos 
and a  adopting rules that establish new rate methods for such pipelines 
under the new rules  effective january   interstate oil pipelines can change rates based on an inflation index  though other rate mechanisms may be used in specific circumstances 
the united states court of appeals upheld ferc s orders in these rules have had little  if any  effect on the company with respect to the cost of moving oil to market 
state regulation oil and gas operations are subject to various types of regulation at the state and local levels 
such regulation includes requirements for drilling permits  the method of developing new fields  the spacing and operations of wells and waste prevention 
the production rate may be regulated and the maximum daily production allowable from oil and gas wells may be established on a market demand or conservation basis 
these regulations may limit production by well and the number of wells or locations that can be drilled 
the company may become a party to agreements relating to the construction or operations of pipeline systems for the transportation of natural gas 
to the extent that such gas is produced  transported and consumed wholly within one state  such operations may  in certain instances  be subject to the state s administrative authority charged with regulating pipelines 
the rates that can be charged for gas  the transportation of gas  and the construction and operation of such pipelines would be subject to the regulations governing such matters 
certain states have recently adopted regulations with respect to gathering systems  and other states are considering regulations with respect to gathering systems 
new regulations passed have not had a material effect on the operations of the company s gathering systems  but the company cannot predict whether any further rules will be adopted or  if adopted  the effect these rules may have on its gathering systems 
federal  state or indian leases the company s operations on federal  state or indian oil and gas leases are subject to numerous restrictions  including nondiscrimination statutes 
such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the bureau of land management  minerals management service and other agencies 
environmental regulations various federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  directly impact oil and gas exploration  development and production operations  and consequently may impact the company s operations and costs 
management believes that the company is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
to date  the company has not expended any material amounts to comply with such regulations  and management does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company

item legal proceedings on april   a class action lawsuit  styled booth  et al 
v 
cross timbers oil company  was filed against the company in the district court of dewey county  oklahoma 
the action was filed on behalf of all persons who  at any time since june  have been paid royalties on gas produced from any gas well within the state of oklahoma under which the company has assumed the obligation to pay royalties 
the plaintiffs allege that the company has reduced royalty payments by post production deductions and has entered into contracts with subsidiaries that were not arms length transactions  which actions reduced the royalties paid to the plaintiffs and those similarly situated  and that such actions are a breach of the leases under which the royalties are paid 
these deductions allegedly include production and post production costs  marketing costs  administration costs and costs incurred by the company in gathering  compressing  dehydrating  processing  treating  blending and or transporting the gas produced 
the company contends that  to the extent any fees are proportionately borne by the plaintiffs  these fees are established by arm s length negotiations with third parties  or if charged by affiliates  are comparable to fees charged by other third party gatherers or processors 
the company further contends that any such fees enhance the value of the gas or the products derived from the gas 
the plaintiffs are seeking an accounting and payment of the monies allegedly owed to them

cross timbers oil company  et al  was filed in the u 
s 
district court for the western district of oklahoma against the company and certain of its subsidiaries by jack j 
grynberg on behalf of the united states under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act 
the plaintiff alleges that the company underpaid royalties on gas produced from federal leases and lands owned by native americans by at least during the past years as a result of mismeasuring the volume of gas and incorrectly analyzing its heating content 
the plaintiff seeks to recover the amount of royalties not paid  together with treble damages  a civil penalty of  to  for each violation and attorney fees and expenses 
the plaintiff has made similar allegations in over actions filed against over other companies 
after its review  the department of justice decided in april not to intervene  and the court unsealed the case in may a federal multi district litigation panel has ordered that the lawsuits filed by grynberg against the company and other companies be transferred and consolidated to the federal district court in wyoming

product prices 
in addition to supply and demand  oil and gas prices are affected by substantial seasonal  political and other fluctuations the company generally cannot control or predict 
crude oil prices are generally determined by global supply and demand 
posted crude oil prices ranged from to during most of  then declined to a average in december crude oil prices continued to decline throughout  dropping to a west texas intermediate price of per barrel in december  the lowest level since after a weak first quarter  oil prices increased in because of production cuts by opec and other leading oil exporters  reduced inventories and anticipated increased demand 
by november  crude oil prices reached their highest levels since the persian gulf war and have remained at levels above in first quarter members of opec met on march  and agreed to increase production by 
because of increased summer demand  increased production is not expected to substantially increase domestic inventories until fourth quarter the company has entered oil futures contracts to sell  bbls per day from april through june at prices ranging from to per bbl 
based on production  the company estimates that a per barrel increase or decrease in the average oil sales price would result in approximately a million change in annual operating cash flow 
natural gas prices are influenced by north american supply and demand  which is often dependent upon weather conditions 
natural gas competes with alternative energy sources as a fuel for heating and the generation of electricity 
generally because of colder weather  storage concerns and us economic growth  prices remained relatively high during most of  reaching their highest levels since gas prices declined  however  in december and remained lower throughout and first quarter  primarily because the winters of and were abnormally mild in the central and eastern us cooler spring weather and lower industry production levels strengthened gas prices in second quarter this trend continued into third quarter when the nymex gas price rose above 
natural gas prices have remained volatile during the winter of as a third consecutive warm winter reduced seasonal heating demand 
in spite of a warm winter  natural gas inventories are expected to be substantially lower at the end of withdrawal season than in lower inventories of approximately tcf  compared with tcf in march  are attributable to lower domestic productive capacity 
lower production  reduced inventories and increasing summer demand are expected to result in volatile natural gas prices averaging higher than levels 
at march  the average nymex price for the following months was per mmbtu 
the company has entered commodity price hedging instruments to reduce its exposure to gas price fluctuations 
as a result of these commodity hedging instruments  the company s average gas price decreased from to in and increased from to in largely influenced by crude oil prices  natural gas liquids prices were weak in and rose significantly in based on production  the company estimates that a per mcf increase or decrease in the average gas sales price would result in approximately a million change in annual operating cash flow 
impairment provision

interest related to investment in equity securities has been classified as part of the loss on investment in equity securities 
interest expense per mcfe increased from in to in primarily as the result of an increase in the weighted average borrowings to fund treasury stock purchases 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities  producing property sales  including sales of royalty trust units  public offerings of equity and debt  and bank debt 
other than for operations  the company s cash requirements are generally for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties  and debt and dividend payments 
exploration and development expenditures and dividend payments have generally been funded by cash flow from operations 
the company believes that its sources of liquidity are adequate to fund its cash requirements in cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared with cash used by operating activities of million in and million cash provided by operations in fluctuations during this three year period were primarily because of purchases of equity securities and lower product prices in and increased production from acquisitions and development activity in before changes in operating assets and liabilities and exploration expense  cash flow from operations was million in  million in and million in financial condition total assets increased from billion at december  to billion at december   primarily because of the acquisitions 
as of december   total capitalization of the company was billion  of which was long term debt 
this compares with capitalization of billion at december   of which was long term debt 
the decrease in the debt to capitalization ratio from year end to is because of funding a significant portion of the acquisitions from sources other than debt and repayment of debt from proceeds from the sale of hugoton royalty trust units 
working capital the company generally uses available cash to reduce bank debt and  therefore  does not maintain large cash and cash equivalent balances 
short term liquidity needs are satisfied by bank commitments under the loan agreement see financing below 
because of this  and since the company s principal source of operating cash flows ie  proved reserves to be produced in the following year cannot be reported as working capital  the company often has low or negative working capital 
working capital of million at december  and million at december  was primarily attributable to the investment in equity securities and the deferred tax benefit related to the net unrealized loss on the investment 
the decrease in the current deferred income tax benefit of million from december  to december  is related to the decline in the unrealized loss on investment in equity securities  resulting from sale of securities and improvement in the market value of securities held

the company periodically renegotiates the loan agreement to increase the borrowing commitment and extend the revolving facility  however  the company cannot assure that it can continue to do so in the future 
the borrowing base is redetermined annually based on the value and expected cash flow of the company s proved oil and gas reserves 
if borrowings exceed the redetermined borrowing base  the banks may require that the excess be repaid within a year 
otherwise  borrowings under the loan agreement do not mature until june   but may be prepaid at any time without penalty 
the borrowing base is expected to be redetermined in may in connection with consolidation of bank debt of the company  spring holding company and summer acquisition company 
based on year end proved reserves and relatively strong commodity prices  the company expects a significant increase in the borrowing base upon its redetermination 
spring holding company  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  has a million revolving credit facility with commercial banks which had a borrowing base of million and unused borrowing capacity of million at december  the borrowing base is subject to semiannual redeterminations 
the credit facility is secured by properties owned by spring and is nonrecourse to the company

borrowings under the credit facility were used to partially fund the ocean energy acquisition 
the credit facility is secured by the properties acquired and is nonrecourse to the company and lehman 
borrowings under the credit facility mature on september  the and acquisitions were partially funded by the sale and issuance of common stock 
the acquisitions were also partially funded by contributions from lehman  the company s equity partner 
these transactions are described under general above 
see also capital expenditures below 
capital expenditures because of their size  the acquisitions were made jointly with lehman as a equity partner 
pursuant to its call option  the company acquired lehman s interest in the spring holding acquisition in september the company plans to exercise its option to purchase lehman s interest in the ocean energy acquisition on march  for approximately million  funded primarily by the proceeds from sales of property and equity securities 
if the company does not exercise its option to purchase lehman s interest by september   lehman will have the right to sell its interest to the company on that date for million 
the company plans to fund any future acquisitions through a combination of cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales  bank debt  public equity or debt transactions 
there are no restrictions under the company s revolving credit agreement that would affect the company s ability to use its remaining borrowing capacity for acquisitions of producing properties 
in february  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of million shares of company s common stock  or approximately of the shares outstanding 
these shares will be purchased from time to time in open market or negotiated transactions

in  exploration and development cash expenditures totaled million  compared with the budget of million 
the company has budgeted million for the development program 
as it has done historically  the company expects to fund the development program with cash flow from operations 
since there are no material long term commitments associated with this budget  the company has the flexibility to adjust its actual development expenditures in response to changes in product prices  industry conditions and the effects of the company s acquisition and development programs 
a minor portion of the company s existing properties are operated by third parties which control the timing and amount of expenditures required to exploit the company s interests in such properties 
therefore  the company cannot assure the timing or amount of these expenditures 
to date  the company has not spent significant amounts to comply with environmental or safety regulations  and it does not expect to do so during however  developments such as new regulations  enforcement policies or claims for damages could result in significant future costs

in addition  the company s bank loan agreement restricts the amount of common stock dividends to of cash flow from operations  as defined  for the last four quarters 
cumulative dividends on series a convertible preferred stock are paid quarterly  when declared by the board of directors  based on an annual rate of per share  or million annually 
year year  or the ability of computer systems to process dates with years beyond  affects almost all companies and organizations 
computer systems that are not year compliant could have material adverse effects on companies and organizations that rely upon those systems 
the transition to the year has had no significant impact on the company s computer systems and computer controlled equipment  and the company does not foresee any material system failures in the coming months 
the company will continue to monitor its year status throughout the year 
the company reviewed its computer systems and computer controlled field equipment and made the necessary modifications for year compliance by december the company estimates that total costs related to year compliance efforts will be less than  of which approximately  has been incurred and expensed through december the company also identified significant third parties whose year compliance could affect it and formally inquired about their year status 
the company is not aware of any significant third parties who have experienced a material year system failure 
despite its efforts to assure that significant third parties are year compliant  the company cannot provide assurance that third parties will not experience material system failures in the coming months 
although the potential effect of year non compliance by third parties is unknown  the company has developed appropriate contingency plans in the event of related system failures 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which was required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after june  in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
which delays the effective date of statement for one year  to fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of sfas no 
should have no significant impact on the company s reported earnings  but could materially affect comprehensive income 
production imbalances the company has gas production imbalance positions that are the result of partial interest owners selling more or less than their proportionate share of gas on jointly owned wells 
imbalances are generally settled by disproportionate gas sales over the remaining life of the well or by cash payment by the overproduced party to the underproduced party 
the company uses the entitlement method of accounting for natural gas sales 
at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a net payable of million for a net overproduced balancing position of  mcf of natural gas  and a receivable of million for an underproduced balancing position of  mcf of carbon dioxide 
production imbalances do not have  and are not expected to have  a significant impact on the company s liquidity or operations 
forward looking statements certain information included in this annual report on form k and other materials filed by the company with the commission contain forward looking statements relating to the company s operations and the oil and gas industry 
such forward looking statements are based on management s current projections and estimates and are identified by words such as expects  intends  plans  projects  anticipates  believes  estimates and similar words 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are crude oil and natural gas price fluctuations  the company s ability to acquire oil and gas properties that meet its objectives and to identify prospects for drilling  potential delays or failure to achieve expected production from existing and future exploration and development projects  and potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation 
in addition  these forward looking statements may be affected by general domestic and international economic and political conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company only uses derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes 
these instruments principally include interest rate swap agreements and commodity futures  swaps and option agreements 
these financial and commodity based derivative contracts are used to limit the risks of interest rate fluctuations and natural gas and crude oil price changes 
gains and losses on these derivatives are offset by losses and gains on the respective hedged exposures 
the board of directors has adopted a policy governing the use of derivative instruments  which requires that all derivatives used by the company relate to an underlying  offsetting position  anticipated transaction or firm commitment  and prohibits the use of speculative  highly complex or leveraged derivatives 
the policy also requires review and approval by the executive vice president of all risk management programs using derivatives and all derivative transactions 
these programs are also periodically reviewed by the board of directors 
hypothetical changes in interest rates and prices chosen for the estimated sensitivity effects are considered to be reasonably possible near term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category 
it is not possible to accurately predict future changes in interest rates  product prices and investment market values 
accordingly  these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk on short term and long term debt carrying variable interest rates 
the company s variable rate debt was approximately million at december  the company attempts to balance the benefit of lower cost variable rate debt that has inherent increased risk with more expensive fixed rate debt that has less market risk 
this is accomplished through a mix of bank debt with short term variable rates and fixed rate subordinated debt  as well as the use of interest rate swaps 
the following table shows the carrying amount and fair value of long term debt and interest rate swaps  and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a basis point change in interest rates 
the hypothetical change in fair value could result in a gain or a loss depending on an increase or decrease in the interest rate 
hypothetical carrying fair change in in thousands amount value fair value december  long term debt    interest rate swaps december  long term debt    interest rate swaps   commodity price risk the company hedges a portion of the market risks associated with its crude oil and natural gas sales 
during and  the company primarily entered oil and gas futures contracts and gas basis swap agreements to reduce exposure to price volatility in the physical markets 
as of december   outstanding futures contracts had a fair value loss of million and outstanding basis swap agreements had a fair value loss of million 
these futures contracts and basis swap agreements are not recorded on the company s balance sheet 
as of december   outstanding futures contracts had a fair value gain of million and outstanding basis swap agreements had a fair value loss of million 
at year end  the total effect of a hypothetical change in natural gas prices  oil prices and gas basis would result in approximately a million change in the fair value of these financial instruments 
this sensitivity does not include the effects of commodity contracts that cannot be settled in cash or another financial instrument 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
investment in equity securities the company is subject to price risk on its unhedged portfolio of publicly traded investment in equity securities of energy companies 
the fair value of these securities at december  was million 
at year end  a change in equity price would increase or decrease portfolio fair value and pre tax earnings by approximately million 
during the first quarter of  the company sold most of this investment at a gain of million 
equity securities held at march  had a fair value of million
