year readiness disclosure made pursuant to the year information and readiness disclosure act  pub 
l 
no 
the year presented potential concerns and issues for the company as well as other companies in the information technology industry 
in general  year readiness issues typically arose in computer software and hardware systems that use two digit date formats  instead of four digit dates  to represent a particular year 
users had to test their unique combination of hardware  system software including databases  transaction processors  and operating systems and application software in order to achieve year readiness 
year committee the company established a year steering committee under the auspices of the company s senior technical executive to evaluate  plan and implement policies and practices  including contingency planning  and to address the impact of the year on the company and its products 
the company s year readiness preparations fell into three categories product readiness  addressing product functionality  internal readiness  addressing the year operability of internal information technology it systems and mission critical non it systems  and third party readiness  addressing the preparedness of relevant third parties and the year operability of products furnished for internal use and resale 
after reviewing these areas  the committee reported to the board of directors specific areas of concern and a plan for resolving and further testing of any remaining year issues 
the committee also formulated a contingency plan in the event that the committee reasonably determined that certain year issues may not be resolved by the end of or if unforeseen problems arose 
as of the date of this filing  the company has not encountered any material problems 
despite this fact  the company and the steering committee remain focused on addressing any problems that may arise 
the company does not anticipate any material problems 
should any problems arise  the company believes it has adequate resources to address them properly 
product readiness the company established year date operability standards against which the most current versions of its software products were tested 
the company completed testing of its current line of unison r software products and determined that the most current versions conform to these standards and were year ready 
in connection with the acquisition of answersoft  inc in may  the company acquired the concerto tm line of software tool products 
the company completed testing of the current releases of concerto tm software products and determined that they were year ready  except iir 
all versions of iir were not believed to be year ready 
all customers were notified to upgrade to smartrouteo  which was year ready 
despite the company s testing and despite the pausing of december   there can be no assurance that the company s products do not contain undetected errors or defects related to year operability that may result in material costs to the company or that the company s products contain all features and functionality considered necessary by customers  end users and distributors to be year ready 
in early  the company discontinued its computerized automated dialing system cas and communications resource server crs product lines and introduced the unison brand line of software products 
support of the cas and crs products were discontinued as of december  the company did not test the cas and crs product lines and believes that they do not conform to its test standards and were not year ready 
the company notified known users of these products that support was being discontinued and that users may experience year related operability issues 
users of these discontinued or legacy products were encouraged to migrate to the unison product line 
the company s exposure arising from its legacy products is not known 
the company does expect to incur additional costs associated with migrating users of legacy products  but does not believe these costs will be material 
while the company believes that most of its current releases of products are year ready  other factors may result in an application created using the company s products not being year ready 
some of these factors include improper programming techniques used by third parties in creating the application  customization  or non compliance of hardware  software or firmware not provided by the company with which the products operate 
the company does not believe that it would be liable in such an event 
however  due to the unprecedented nature of the potential litigation related to year readiness as discussed in the industry and popular press  the most likely worst case scenario is that the company would be subject to litigation 
it is uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected by such litigation 
the company tested only the current versions of its products and did not test earlier versions of its products 
the company believes some of its customers may be running product versions which have not been tested and may experience year date related operability issues 
the company identified these customers and encouraged them to migrate to current versions of the products 
further  the company cautioned users of such products to conduct their own year operability testing to determine if continued use of the products allowed them to meet their own year readiness objectives 
while many customers were upgraded to year ready versions of products under maintenance coverage  if eligible  in the normal course the company expects to incur some increased expenses associated with the furnishing of upgrades and modifications 
at this time  the company does not believe that the cost of potential upgrades or modifications will have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
to date  the company has not experienced any material adverse effects due to the year readiness of the most recent version of its products 
internal readiness the company conducted a year readiness audit of its internal it systems including telecommunication  facilities management  safety and security systems 
the company did not encounter any material operational issues or incurring material costs associated with preparing its internal it and non it systems for the year  the company will continue to monitor its systems and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience unanticipated negative consequences or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems  which include third party hardware  firmware  and software 
to date  the company has not experienced any material adverse effects on its internal systems due to year readiness 
third party readiness the company assessed the year readiness of its material third parties  such as public utilities and key clients and suppliers  who provide external services to the company 
the company has certain key relationships with suppliers which furnish components and software used by the company in its products 
if these suppliers fail to adequately address the year issue for the products they supply the company  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  reputation  and financial results 
certain of the company s products contain third party components and software that is integral to its operation for which the cost and time to integrate alternative components or software into these products would be material 
to date  the company has not experienced any material adverse effects on its business due the year readiness of its material third parties 
contingency plans and worst case scenario the company developed contingency plans to operate in the event that its products  systems  or business partners were not year ready 
the company did not experience any material adverse effects on its business due to the year readiness of its products  systems or business partners 
costs  source of funds and accounting treatment the company expensed all costs related to its year compliance program unless the useful life of the technological asset was extended or increased 
the expenses incurred to date have not had a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company funded its year expenses through cash flows from operations 
the impact of the year was and remains difficult to discern  but it is not considered to be a material risk when evaluating future growth and performance of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
as of december  and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
all of the company s investments are short term  euro dollar bonds  investment grade commercial paper  and money market accounts that are carried on the company s books at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio of cash equivalent and short term investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
the company s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of its international subsidiaries are almost exclusively conducted in their respective local currencies 
international subsidiary operating results are translated into us dollars and consolidated for reporting purposes 
the impact of currency exchange rate movements on inter company transactions was immaterial for the years ended december   and currently the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
