the lower property and casualty revenues were due primarily to the net effects of higher workers compensation insurance premiums and investment income resulting from the acquisitions of unicare on september  and industrial on august   more than offset by additional ceded reinsurance premiums which have the result of lowering premium revenues 
these additional ceded reinsurance premiums were due mainly to additional excess of loss reinsurance purchased for fremont s workers compensation insurance business which was in effect from january  through december  see item business property and casualty insurance operation reinsurance ceded 
higher revenues in the financial services segment in as compared to were achieved primarily from increased loan interest revenues which resulted from significant growth in the average financial services loan portfolio and to higher gains on whole loan sales of residential real estate loans

see general 
the property and casualty insurance operation posted a loss before taxes of million for  as compared to income before taxes of million and million for and  respectively 
the loss before taxes in was due primarily to the combined effect of a significant decrease in the second half of in the company s estimates of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses  and the recognition of a million charge before taxes associated with a settlement agreement executed on february  with reliance insurance company reliance under a workers compensation reinsurance contract that was in effect from january  through december  see property and casualty insurance operation special discussion concerning property and casualty insurance results and item business property and casualty insurance operation reinsurance ceded 
the increase in income before taxes of in as compared to was due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of industrial s operating results and lower losses incurred resulting from the additional reinsurance purchased by the company which was effective from january  through december  the combined ratio for was as compared to and for and  respectively 
through january  the company maintained a small medical malpractice insurance operation within the property and casualty insurance segment 
on january   the company entered into reinsurance and assumption agreements with a reinsurer whereby substantially all of the assets and liabilities related to the medical malpractice policies were ceded to the reinsurer

revenues from the medical malpractice operation were million for the financial services segment posted income before taxes of million for  as compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in is due primarily to the combined effect of a significant growth in the average loan portfolio of the financial services operation to billion in from billion in  and the recognition of a million gain before taxes resulting from the december  sale of the company s commercial finance subsidiary 
partially offsetting these increases in income before taxes were lower gains in on residential real estate whole loan sales 
furthermore  the company did not recognize any gains in conjunction with three securitizations of residential real estate loans completed in the increase in income before taxes in as compared to is due mainly to the general growth in the average financial services loan portfolio to billion in from billion in  as well as gains in on residential real estate whole loan sales

property and casualty insurance operation the following table represents information with respect to fremont s property and casualty insurance operation year ended december  thousands of dollars revenues    expenses    income loss before taxes    revenues from the property and casualty insurance operation consist of workers compensation insurance premiums earned and net investment income 
expenses consist primarily of loss and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition costs and other operating costs and expenses 
special discussion concerning property and casualty insurance results 
in  the company s property and casualty insurance operation recorded a loss before taxes from continuing operations of million 
this loss resulted primarily from the combined adverse effect on incurred loss and loss adjustment expense lae of a lower than expected level of reinsurance recoverables than had been actuarially predicted  coupled with the company s recognition of the settlement agreement with reliance under a reinsurance treaty that was in effect from january  through december  with regard to the lower than expected reinsurance recoverables  in the third and fourth quarters of  the company lowered its estimate of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses for the and accident years by approximately million 
this decrease was in recognition of a lower than actuarially predicted level of incurred losses ceded under certain reinsurance contracts that were in effect from january  through december  these reinsurance contracts reduced the company s net loss exposure from a historical retention of million per occurrence to  per occurrence 
see item business property and casualty insurance operation reinsurance ceded 
prior to entering into these reinsurance agreements  the company had estimated its expected gross incurred loss and lae 
estimates of incurred loss and lae  net of reinsurance recoveries  were then established utilizing actuarial indications based upon historical experience and other factors considered appropriate to forecast incurred losses to be ceded under these reinsurance agreements 
during the third quarter of and pursuant to its regular review of net incurred loss and lae estimates  the company observed a deterioration in these net loss and lae estimates as compared to the actuarial predictions 
to assist the company in its determination of net loss and lae reserve estimates  the company retained outside actuarial consultants who performed an independent actuarial analysis of the company s net loss and lae reserves as of june  these actuarial indications were reaffirmed at september  and further re evaluated by the independent outside actuaries at december   which resulted in the company s recognition of the deterioration in reinsurance recoverables in the third and fourth quarters of based on the company s review of these actuarial indications and consequent recognition of the deterioration in estimated reinsurance recoverables  the company believes its estimates of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses are an adequate provision for loss recoveries under reinsurance agreements 
see variability of operating results 
while the upward development in the company s estimates of net loss and lae reserves during calendar year was comprised primarily of adjustments to reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses  the company has observed for its primary regions relative stability in its workers compensation gross loss and allocated loss adjustment expense ratios derived from the actuarial indications of reserves for loss and allocated loss adjustment expense  gross of reinsurance recoverables 
also contributing to the company s loss before taxes in was the recognition of million in lower reinsurance recoverables on the and accident years pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into february  between the company and reliance under a reinsurance contract that was in effect from january  through december  under the settlement agreement  the company is to receive in excess of million in cash and will no longer have any involvement with the reliance workers compensation reinsurance programs brokered for reliance by unicover managers  inc the company evaluated the adequacy of the expected cash settlement under the agreement through an independent actuarial analysis of the expected losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses to be paid under the reliance reinsurance contract after december  a range of expected loss payments was estimated and then discounted to a present value basis using investment yields considered appropriate 
based on these indications  the cash settlement is within the range of present values 
the million decrease in reinsurance recoverables represents primarily the adjustment necessary to bring the estimated reinsurance recoverables relating to the and accident years under the reinsurance contract with reliance to a present value basis at december  see item business property and casualty insurance operation reinsurance ceded 
premiums 
premiums earned from the company s property and casualty insurance operation were million for  as compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the increase of in premiums earned in as compared to is due primarily to new business development and  to a lesser extent  the acquisition of unicare 
new business development was significant in totaling approximately million in estimated annual direct premiums written  as compared to million in estimated annual direct premiums written for using estimated annual premiums on policies in effect at december  and referred to as inforce premiums  the company s inforce premium has grown to billion at december  from million at december  while the growth in inforce premium is considered significant  the company believes it has remained conservative in its underwriting standards 
this is evidenced by the fact that the new business written in represents only of the approximate billion in estimated annual premiums submitted to the company for underwriting consideration in this percentage compares to for and is in line with the company s historical experience 
the growth in inforce premium has occurred across all of the company s geographic regions nationally 
see variability of operating results and workers compensation regulation 
the lower insurance premiums in as compared to were due mainly to the offsetting effects of higher workers compensation insurance premiums resulting from the acquisitions of unicare and industrial  more than offset by additional ceded reinsurance premiums in these additional ceded reinsurance premiums were due mainly to additional excess of loss reinsurance purchased for the company s workers compensation insurance business  which was in effect from january  through december  this additional reinsurance reduced the point at which reinsurers assume liability from million per loss occurrence to  per loss occurrence 
with the expiration of these reinsurance agreements  the company s ceded premium expense in the future is expected to be significantly lower than the ceded premium expense levels recognized in and see item business property and casualty insurance operation reinsurance ceded and note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net investment income 
net investment income within the property and casualty insurance operation was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
higher invested assets associated with the unicare acquisition were more than offset by higher ceded reinsurance costs and claim payments  resulting in lower investment income in as compared to the higher investment income in as compared to was due mainly to significantly higher average invested assets resulting from the acquisitions of unicare and industrial 
see item business investment portfolio 
loss and loss adjustment expense 
the property and casualty loss and lae incurred was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition  the ratio of these losses and lae to property and casualty insurance premiums earned loss ratio was  and in  and  respectively 
the loss ratio increased significantly in as compared to due to the combined adverse effect on loss and lae incurred of a lower than expected level of reinsurance recoveries than had been actuarially predicted  coupled with the effect of the company s recognition of the settlement agreement with reliance under a reinsurance treaty that was in effect from january  through december  see special discussion concerning property and casualty insurance results and item business property and casualty insurance operation reinsurance ceded 
the decrease in the loss ratio in as compared to is due predominately to the additional reinsurance purchased by fremont and which was in effect from january  through december   offset partially by higher loss ratios in associated with industrial 
fremont s property and casualty insurance operation is required to maintain reserves to cover the company s ultimate liability for losses and lae with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
the company regularly reviews its reserving techniques  overall reserve position and reinsurance 
in light of present facts and current legal interpretations  management believes that adequate provisions have been made for loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables 
these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liabilities  but instead are estimates involving actuarial projections at a given time of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost  including estimates of reinsurance recoveries associated with the estimated claims costs 
these projections are based on facts and circumstances then known  predictions of future events  estimates of future trends in claims frequency and severity  and judicial theories of liability  as well as other factors 
the establishment of appropriate gross loss and lae reserves and reinsurance recoverables is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that currently established gross loss and lae reserves and reinsurance recoverables will prove to be adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
subsequent actual experience has resulted  and could result  in net loss and lae reserves being too high or too low 
fremont s future loss and lae development could require an increase in its gross loss and lae reserves or a decrease in its reinsurance recoverables from prior periods  which would adversely affect the company s earnings in future periods 
policy acquisition costs and other operating costs and expenses 
the ratio of policy acquisition costs and other operating costs and expenses to premiums earned is referred to as the expense ratio  which was  and in  and  respectively 
the lower expense ratio in as compared to is due mainly to the significant increase in the premium base in resulting from increases in new business development  as well as to the acquisition of unicare 
the increase in this ratio in as compared to is due mainly to a lower premium base in resulting from the additional reinsurance purchased by fremont that was effective from january  through december  see premiums 
dividends to policyholders 
the company s policyholder dividends ratio was  and in  and  respectively 
the low ratios are due primarily to the type of workers compensation insurance policies written by the company 
fremont s workers compensation insurance policies are generally written as non participating  which means that they do not include provisions for dividend consideration 
see item business regulation workers compensation regulation 
variability of operating results 
the company s profitability can be affected significantly by many factors including competition  the severity and frequency of claims  fluctuation in interest rates and the rate of inflation  legislation and regulations  court decisions  the judicial climate and general economic conditions and trends  all of which are outside of the company s control 
in addition  fremont s results may be affected by its ability to assess and integrate successfully the operations of acquired companies  as well as the company s ability to contain expenses and to implement appropriate technological changes 
any of these factors could contribute to significant variation in the company s results of operations within the different aspects of its business  or businesses taken as a whole  from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
also  the establishment of appropriate loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  necessarily involves estimates  and reserve adjustments have caused significant fluctuations in operating results from year to year 
with respect to fremont s workers compensation insurance business  changes in economic conditions can lead to reduced premium levels due to lower payrolls as well as increased claims due to the tendency of workers who are laid off to submit workers compensation insurance claims 
changes in market interest rates can affect the amount of interest income that the company earns on its investment portfolio  as well as the amount of realized and unrealized gains or losses on specific holdings within the company s investment portfolio 
legislative and regulatory changes can also cause the operating results of the company s workers compensation insurance businesses to vary 
fremont s workers compensation insurance business competes in a market characterized by competition on the basis of price and service 
in addition  state regulatory changes could affect competition in the states where the company transacts business 
although the company is one of the largest writers of workers compensation insurance in the nation  certain of its competitors are larger and have greater resources than fremont 
the company cannot be certain that it will continue to maintain its market share in the future or that the company will be able to obtain adequate pricing for its insurance products 
over the past several years  the company has observed a reduction in the number of competitors resulting from the consolidation of companies into other entities  companies who are forced to terminate underwriting activities through regulatory actions by state insurance authorities  as well as from companies electing to reduce or discontinue the writing of workers compensation insurance in certain jurisdictions 
fremont s workers compensation insurance operations are concentrated in california and illinois  with of the company s premium inforce being located in these two states 
because of this concentration  the company s financial position and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be influenced by general trends in the respective states economies  and in particular  the condition of the workers compensation insurance market within each state 
the impact of unfavorable economic conditions  legislation and other trends within these two states may result in greater uncertainty and volatility in the company s business operations and could adversely affect the results of fremont s operations and its financial condition more than if the company s premium had been originated with more geographic diversification 
workers compensation regulation 
the company s workers compensation insurance operation has premiums inforce in forty five states and the district of columbia 
insurance companies are subject to supervision and regulation by the state insurance authority in each state in which they transact business 
such supervision and regulation relate to the numerous aspects of an insurance company s business and financial condition 
the primary purpose of such supervision and regulation is the protection of injured workers and policyholders rather than investors or stockholders of an insurer 
fremont s multistate insurance operations require  and will continue to require  significant resources of the company in order to continue to comply with the regulations of each state in which fremont transacts business 
illinois began operating under an open rating system in and california began operating under such a system effective january  generally  in an open rating system  workers compensation insurance companies are provided with advisory premium rates expected losses and expenses or loss costs expected losses only which vary by job classification 
each insurance company sets its base rates to reflect its particular loss experience and operating costs 
although insurance companies are not required to adopt such advisory premium rates  companies in illinois generally follow such rates 
however  insurance companies in california have  since the adoption of an open rating system  generally set their premium rates below such advisory rates 
before january   california operated under a minimum rate law  whereby premium rates established by the california department of insurance were the minimum rates that could be charged by an insurance carrier 
the repeal of the minimum rate law has resulted in lower premiums and profitability on the company s california workers compensation insurance policies due to increased price competition 
beginning in the second half of  however  fremont observed a lessening of price competition in its primary regions of california and illinois 
more recently  in january fremont experienced weighted average renewal premium rate increases of and in california and illinois  respectively  and fremont s total inforce premiums for all regions combined remained in excess of billion at january  it is uncertain however  whether the observed lessening in the competitive environment and the company s ability to increase premium rates will continue 
financial services operation the financial services operation of fremont general credit corporation is principally engaged in commercial and residential real estate lending  syndicated loans and insurance premium financing 
revenues consist principally of interest income and  to a lesser extent  gains on whole loan sales  fees and other income 
prior to the december  sale of the company s commercial finance subsidiary  fremont provided commercial finance loans  primarily secured by accounts receivable  inventory  and machinery and equipment  to small and middle market companies on a nationwide basis 
the following table presents information with respect to fremont s financial services operation year ended december  thousands of dollars revenues    expenses    income before taxes    revenues increased and in and  respectively  due primarily to greater loan interest revenue attributable to growth in the average financial services loan portfolio over the three year period ended december  the average financial services loan portfolio grew in to billion from billion and billion in and  respectively 
also contributing to the increase in revenues in is a gain before taxes of million recognized by the company from the december  sale of its commercial finance subsidiary 
partially offsetting the increase in interest revenues were lower gains on the whole loan sales of residential real estate loans 
gains on whole loan sales were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
whole loan sales are cash transactions made without recourse to the company or its subsidiaries 
the lower whole loan sales resulted from an observed decrease in the price for the company s residential real estate loans beginning in the second half of this condition was a consequence of market disruptions and an oversupply of loans available for sale which occurred during this same period 
rather than sell its loans at cash prices lower than what it believed was the economic benefit to be derived  the company began a program to retain these benefits by either retaining the loans in its portfolio or by securitizing them 
during  fremont sold billion in residential real estate loans  comprised of billion in loans sold in three securitizations and million in whole loan sales to other financial institutions 
in and  residential real estate loan sales of million and million  respectively  were represented entirely by whole loan sales 
for the year ended december   the company has not recognized any gain on the residual interests retained from the three securitizations  since the value of the residual interests is subject to substantial credit  prepayment  and interest rate risks on the loans sold 
while this reduces current period income  income may be recognized in future periods if the company s original assumptions develop favorably 
see variability of operating results

non performing assets at december  were lower than december  despite total loans receivable increasing to billion at december  from billion at december the higher provision for loan losses in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year is consistent with the significant increase in average total loans receivable to billion in from billion in while net charge offs as a percentage of average total loans receivable has increased in to as compared to in  the increase is due primarily to commercial finance loans charged off within the company s commercial finance subsidiary which was sold in december the coverage of the allowance for possible loan losses to non accrual loans and accrual loans days past due has remained high at as of december  the lower provision for loan losses in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is due primarily to improved loan loss experience 
this improvement is evidenced by the decrease in net charge offs to million in as compared to million in  while total loans receivable increased during this same period 
residential real estate loan securitizations 
as previously discussed  the company s residential real estate operation began a program in of selling loans through securitization 
in the company s securitizations  the company sells residential real estate loans to a special purpose entity  which is established for the limited purpose of purchasing the loans and issuing interest bearing securities that represent interests in the loans 
the securitization is treated as a sale and the loans sold are removed from the company s balance sheet 
the securities issued to third party investors are collateralized by the underlying pool of residential real estate loans 
the investors and the special purpose entity have no recourse to the company for failure of the residential loan borrowers to pay when due 
the company retains a residual interest  which represents the right to receive certain future cash flows which are generally equal to the value of the principal and interest to be collected on the loans in excess of i the principal and interest to be paid on the securities  and ii various contractual net servicing fees and other expenses 
most of the company s residual interests  however  are generally restricted until investors and other expenses have been paid or otherwise are subordinate to investor s interests 
upon completion of the securitization  the company records its residual interests as an asset on the balance sheet 
gains or losses on a securitization are based on the estimated fair value of the proceeds from the sale  net of related transaction costs and the allocated carrying value of the loans sold 
fair value is determined by computing the net present value of the estimated cash flows retained  using the dates that such cash flows are expected to be released to the company the cash out method  at a discount rate considered commensurate with the risks associated with the cash flows 
the amounts and timing of the cash flows are estimated after considering various economic factors and other factors  including prepayment speeds and delinquency  default and loss rates 
the outstanding balance of the company s residual interests at december  was million 
since the value of the residual interests is subject to substantial credit  prepayment  and interest rate risks on the loans sold  the company has recognized no gain on the residual interests it has retained 
this reduces the amounts of gain recognized in the current period  however  income may be recognized in future periods if the company s original assumptions develop favorably

variability of operating results 
during periods when economic conditions are unfavorable  the company s financial services businesses may not be able to originate new loan products or maintain the credit quality of its finance receivables  both in its portfolio and for those loans that have been securitized  at previously attained levels 
this may result in increased levels of non performing assets and net credit losses 
changes in market interest rates  or in the relationships between various interest rates could cause fremont s interest margins to be reduced and may result in significant changes in the prepayment patterns of the company s finance receivables 
these risk factors could adversely affect the value of fremont s loans and their related collateral  as well as  the valuation of the residual interests in the company s securitized loans  both of which could adversely affect fremont s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s financial services businesses maintain reserves for credit losses on its portfolio of finance receivables in amounts that the company believes are sufficient to provide adequate protection against potential losses 
the finance receivables that fremont primarily originates  both for its portfolio and for securitization  are generally non conventional and non investment grade loans 
to mitigate for the somewhat higher potential risk of the lending that the company is primarily engaged in and for the impact that adverse economic developments could have on the company s finance receivables  fremont lends primarily on a senior and secured basis and employs a proactive asset management approach 
the company also attempts to carefully evaluate the underlying collateral that secures these loans and to maintain underwriting standards that are designed to effect appropriate loan to collateral valuations and cash flow coverages 
although the company believes that its consolidated level of reserves is sufficient to cover potential credit losses  these reserves could prove to be inadequate due to unanticipated adverse changes in economic conditions or discrete events that adversely affect specific borrowers  industries or markets 
any of these changes could impair the company s ability to realize the expected value of the collateral securing certain of its finance receivables or the timing of the realization thereof 
the company s financial services businesses compete in markets that are highly competitive and are characterized by factors that vary based upon product and geographic region 
the markets in which fremont competes are typically characterized by a large number of competitors who compete based primarily upon price  terms and loan structure 
the company primarily competes with banks and mortgage and finance companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources than fremont 
the competitive forces of these markets could adversely affect the company s net finance income  loan origination volume or net credit losses 
while the company attempts to diversify its loan origination by geographic region  the company s geographic concentration of commercial and residential real estate loans in california may subject its loan portfolio and securitized loans to higher rates of delinquencies  defaults and losses in an economic downturn in california than the rates experienced in loan portfolios having greater geographic diversity 
at december   approximately half of fremont s commercial and residential real estate loans  both in its portfolio and those loans that have been securitized  were collateralized by properties located in california 
adverse events in california  such as real estate market declines or the occurrence of natural disasters upon property located therein  may have a more significant adverse effect upon the company s operating results and financial condition than if a higher percentage of its loans were collateralized by properties located outside california 
fremont s financial services businesses include a federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insured thrift and loan subject to supervision and regulation by the california department of financial institutions and the fdic 
federal and state regulations prescribe certain minimum capital requirements and  while the company s thrift is currently in compliance with such requirements  in the future the company could be required to make additional contributions to its thrift in order to maintain compliance with such requirements 
future changes in government regulation and policy could adversely affect the thrift and loan industry  including fremont s thrift 
such changes in regulations and policies may place restrictions on or make changes to the company s lending business and increase the costs of compliance 
market risk fremont is subject to market risk resulting primarily from fluctuations in interest rates arising from balance sheet financial instruments such as investments  loans and debt 
in the property and casualty insurance operation  the greatest interest rate risk exposure occurs where the interest rate of the financial instrument is fixed in nature and there is a difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate 
the greatest interest rate risk exposure in the financial services operation occurs when interest rate gaps arise wherein assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals or different market indices to which the instruments interest rates are tied 
changes in interest rates will affect the company s net investment income  loan interest  interest expense and total stockholders equity 
the objective of fremont s asset and liability management activities is to provide the highest level of net interest income and to seek cost effective sources of capital  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk 
the company has designated its entire investment portfolio as investments that would be available for sale in response to changing market conditions  liquidity requirements  interest rate movements and other investment factors 
see item business investment portfolio 
fremont currently owns no derivative financial instruments and  consequently  is not subject to market risk for such off balance sheet financial instruments 
furthermore  the company does not have exposure to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
property and casualty insurance operation interest rate risk the property and casualty insurance operation has exposure to changes in long term interest rates due mainly to the significant investment in the available for sale investment portfolio 
fluctuations in these interest rates affect the carrying value of the fixed rate investments resulting in fluctuations in unrealized gains and losses on investments  which also affects the company s stockholders equity 
for an investment in a fixed rate bond  a rise in market interest rates for bonds with a similar remaining term and face amount will result in a decline in the fair value of the fixed rate bond 
the converse situation applies as well

interest rate gaps may arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals or different market indices to which the instruments interest rate is tied and to this degree earnings will be sensitive to interest rate changes 
additionally  interest rate gaps could develop between the market rate and the interest rate on loans in the company s financial services loan portfolio  which could result in borrowers prepaying their loan obligations to fremont 
while the company attempts to match the characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the effect of fluctuations in interest rates  fremont does not currently utilize derivative financial instruments to meet these objectives 
for the financial services operation  the expected maturity date does not necessarily reflect the net market risk exposure because certain instruments are subject to interest rate changes before expected maturity

a securitization has the effect of reducing interest rate risk since the securitized loans are typically removed from the balance sheet 
however  the company retains a residual interest in the securitized loans  and this residual interest is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value million at december  
these residual interests are subordinated to the right of other investors 
residual interests do not have a stated maturity or amortization period 
the expected amount of the net cash flow  as well as the timing of such cash flow  depends on the performance of the underlying collateral supporting each securitization 
the actual cash flow of these instruments could vary substantially if performance is different from the company s assumptions 
fremont develops assumptions to value its residual interests by analyzing past portfolio performance  current loan characteristics and current market and interest rate conditions 
fremont general corporation parent only interest rate risk fremont general corporation is also subject to interest rate exposure related to libor and united states prime interest rates because of its long term debt and other obligations with both fixed and variable interest rates 
for fixed rate obligations  fremont general corporation runs the risk that if market rates decline  the related required payments will exceed those based on the current market rates
