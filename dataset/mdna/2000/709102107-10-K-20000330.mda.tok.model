interest rate protection in order to reduce exposure to variable interest rates  the company entered into a six year interest rate swap agreement with first union  on million of indebtedness which fixes a rate of per annum versus day libor until june financial instruments sensitivity analysis the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in the general level of market interest rates 
in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuation in market interest rates  the company s derivative and other financial instruments consist of long term debt including current portion and an interest rate swap agreement 
all financial instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to as the net financial instrument position 
as of december   the company s consolidated debt portfolio consisted of million in fixed rate mortgage notes and million borrowed under its revolving credit facility 
the company has limited its exposure to increases in libor on its floating rate debt by entering into a million interest rate swap agreement which expires in june and carries a fixed interest rate of versus day libor 
management does not foresee any significant changes in the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations or how such exposure will be managed in the near future 
changes in market interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable portions of the company s debt portfolio 
a change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position  however  it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in market interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
the sensitivity analysis  related to the fixed debt portfolio  assumes an immediate basis point move in interest rates from their actual december  levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the net financial instrument position of million at december  a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the net financial instrument position of million at december  based on the variable rate debt included in the company s debt portfolio  including an interest rate swap agreement  as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional million in interest incurred at december  a basis point decrease would reduce interest incurred by million at december  funds from operations the company computes funds from operations in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
funds from operations increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the increase is primarily due to an improvement in net operating income from residential properties and newly acquired properties in and capital expenditures during calendar  the company expended million for capital expenditures  million per unit owned adjusted for partnership interests for multifamily communities and million for shopping centers 
the company s policy is to capitalize expenditures for floor coverings  appliances and major exterior preparation and painting for apartments 
during the year  million per unit owned was expended for floor covering and million per unit owned for appliances 
environmental matters in  the company established a reserve of million for environmental remediation costs 
in addition  the company received a credit of million for environmental matters in connection with the acquisition of two properties 
since a total of million was charged against the reserve 
the company also reduced the reserve by million leaving a balance of million  which is the company s share of the estimated remaining environmental liability 
there can be no assurance that these amounts will be adequate to cover future environmental costs 
year the company expended approximately million in connection with hardware  software and equipment upgrades and repairs relating to the year issue 
the company did not incur any significant interruption of services in connection with the year  nor does the company expect to incur any in the future 
competition the company s shopping centers compete with other shopping centers in their trade areas as well as alternative retail formats  including catalogues  home shopping networks and internet commerce 
apartment properties compete for tenants with other multifamily properties in their markets 
economic factors  such as employment trends and the level of interest rates  impact shopping center sales as well as a prospective tenant s choice to rent or own his her residence 
inflation inflation can have many effects on the financial performance of the company 
shopping center leases often provide for the payment of rents based on a percentage of sales which may increase with inflation 
leases may also provide for tenants to bear all or a portion of operating expenses which may reduce the impact of such increases on the company 
apartment leases are normally for a one year term which may allow the company to seek increased rents as leases are renewed or when new tenants are obtained
