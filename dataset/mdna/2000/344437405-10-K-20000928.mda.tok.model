the company was formed in to engage in the business of designing  manufacturing and selling mri scanners 
in  the company formed a wholly owned subsidiary  health management corporation of america hmca  formerly known as us health management corporation  in order to expand into the physician and diagnostic management services business 
fonar s principal mri products are its fonar  quad and echo mri scanners 
fonar also considers it stand up mri indomitable tm which has been submitted to the fda for approval  to be one of its most promising new products 
the company believes it is in a position to aggressively seek new sales 
the fonar  quad and stand up mri scanners are highly competitive and totally new non claustrophobic scanners not previously available in the mri market 
at tesla field strength  the quad magnet is the highest field open mri in the industry  offering non claustrophobic mri together with high field image quality for the first time 
the fonar and stand up mri tm share the fundamental technology of the quad scanners and also have a field strength of tesla 
the company s work in progress pinnacle mri scanner will combine fonar s iron frame magnet with a superconducting driver  and is expected to have a field strength between and tesla 
the company expects vigorous sales from its new products 
fonar also offers the echo  a low cost open mri scanner 
see description of business products  works in progress and product marketing 
as part of its scanner marketing program  the company has attended the industry s annual trade show  rsna radiological society of north america since and plans to do so again in november the company believes that it is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the rapidly expanding open mri market  as the manufacturer of the only high field open mri in the industry 
the company expects marked demand for its products since image quality increases as a direct proportion to magnetic field strength 
when commercially available  fonar s stand up mri is expected to be the only mri capable of producing images in the weight bearing state 
in addition  the company s new scanners provide improved image quality and high speed imaging at costs that are significantly less than the competition and more in keeping with the medical cost reduction demands being made by our national leaders on behalf of the public

the company s strategy is to attempt to hold down the price of its quad scanners and to increase profitability by reducing manufacturing costs and increasing volume 
the effectiveness of this strategy will not be discernible until higher sales volume for the company s quad scanners is achieved 
to reduce the cost of manufacturing its quad scanners  the company expanded its manufacturing capacity in fiscal and by acquiring approximately million and million  respectively  worth of new capital equipment

the decline in service revenue reflects the retirement of old scanners by the company s customers 
the company does not expect the decline in revenue to continue

in addition the company plans  through its subsidiary  health management corporation of america  to develop and expand its physician and diagnostic management services business see description of business 
the company believes its present financial resources are sufficient to achieve the sales  service and production levels necessary to support its operations 
the company has developed and begun to implement a new program to finance a portion of the purchase price of its scanners through a newly formed subsidiary  fonar acceptance corporation  and to assist the customer in obtaining the remaining portion of its financing through an independent source or sources 
the new program is intended to increase the overall profitability of the company by assisting in the sale of scanners and participating in the profits derived from financing those sales

while continuing to focus on new sources of income  the company now has commenced aggressive sales and manufacturing of its new generation of open mri scanners and is reemphasizing mri scanner sales 
in addition  the company is enhancing its revenue by entering into the physician and diagnostic management services business through its new subsidiary  hmca 
cost containment programs continue in force notwithstanding an increase in costs and expenses resulting from increased manufacturing activity and marketing of its mri scanners and the expansion of hmca s physician and diagnostic management services business 
these programs  which include increasing the portion of manufacturing conducted on the company s premises  have enabled the company to achieve significantly lower manufacturing costs than would have otherwise been experienced in the production of its quad scanners 
this has enabled the company to pass on to customers a much needed reduction in the sales price of mri scanners 
the company s plan calls for a continuing emphasis on providing its customers with enhanced equipment service and maintenance capabilities and delivering state of the art  innovative and high quality equipment upgrades at competitive prices 
fees for on going service and maintenance from the company s installed base of scanners were million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  transactions between the company and its subsidiaries are eliminated in the consolidation 
the company will continue to aggressively develop and market upgrades and enhancements for previously installed scanners 
the company s working capital surplus as of june  approximates million  as compared to a working capital surplus of million as of june  the change in the company s working capital position resulted primarily from its investments in new equipment million  note payments on the purchase prices for hmca s acquisitions million  its overall operating losses  and an increase in its current liabilities of  million as at june  as compared to million as at june  the company believes that the above mentioned financial resources will provide the cash flows needed to achieve the sales  service and production levels necessary to support its operations
