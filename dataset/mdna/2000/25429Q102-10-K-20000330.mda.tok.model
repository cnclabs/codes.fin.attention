the level of net income in  as compared with  was unfavorably affected by a million increase in non interest expense and an increase in the company s effective income tax rate from for  which reflected certain tax planning strategies  to for the overall improvement in net income reflects the benefits of acquisitions completed during net income in each of and was reduced by million as a result of after tax extraordinary losses on the early extinguishment of debt 
the million  or  increase in net income in  as compared with  was fueled by revenue growth of million  or 
the growth in net income also reflected a million decrease in the provision for loan losses and a reduction in the effective income tax rate of approximately basis points 
the impact of these factors was partially offset by an increase of million in non interest expense 
the significant increases in non interest income and non interest expense were principally due to the company s expansion of its mortgage banking operations  largely as a result of the namc acquisition 
operating earnings  which represent net income adjusted for the effects of certain non recurring or unusual items  amounted to million for  up from million for  which had increased from million for diluted operating earnings per common share increased to for from for and for on an operating earnings basis  the returns on average stockholders equity and average assets rose to and  respectively  for from and  respectively  for and and  respectively  for the following table presents reconcilements of operating earnings to reported net income for the year ended december in thousands operating earnings    items not included in operating earnings net losses related to balance sheet restructurings  net charges and adjustments related to acquisitions  gain on sale of branch  other  net   income tax effect on above items   adjustment to conform internal tax expense to corporate tax expense  extraordinary losses on early extinguishment of debt  net of tax benefits    net adjustments after tax    reported net income    cash operating earnings  which represent operating earnings after the exclusion of the after tax effect of amortization of goodwill  totaled million for  up from cash operating earnings for were million  or higher than the million for diluted cash operating earnings per common share were for  as compared with for and for on a cash operating earnings basis  the returns on average stockholders equity and average assets increased to and  respectively  for from and  respectively  for and and  respectively  for the company believes that operating earnings and cash operating earnings basis information  when taken in conjunction with reported results  provide useful information in evaluating performance on a comparable basis  although neither operating earnings nor cash operating earnings is currently a required basis for reporting financial results under generally accepted accounting principles 
net interest income net interest income amounted to million for  up from million for  which had increased from million for contributing significantly to these increases was growth in the net interest margin 
during  the net interest margin was  as compared with for and for the year to year increases in net interest income also reflect  to a lesser extent  growth in average interest earning assets of million in and million in  as compared with the respective prior years 
the basis point increase in the net interest margin in  as compared with  was driven by a sharp reduction in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities  but also reflects a steepening of the interest rate yield curve and  despite an overall decline in the yield on average interest earning assets  beneficial shifts in the mix of average interest earning assets 
the cost of average interest bearing liabilities for was  down basis points from  primarily reflecting a generally lower short term interest rate environment as well as the company s deposit pricing strategy  particularly with respect to its time deposits 
also contributing to the lower cost of funds was the affect of an increase in the percentage of core deposits to total deposits 
the company s core deposits consist of demand  savings and money market deposits and are generally less costly than the company s time deposits and borrowed funds 
during  core deposits represented of average total deposits  up from for the yield on average interest earning assets of for was down basis points from the reduction in the yield on average interest earning assets was mitigated by the effects of the company s strategy during to increase the aggregate percentage of its commercial real estate  consumer and business loans receivable which generally have higher yields than the company s residential real estate loans receivable to total loans receivable 
the aggregate average balance of commercial real estate  consumer and business loans increased billion  or  in  as compared with  and represented of average total loans receivable for  up from for these increases reflect the effects of acquisitions during as well as internal growth 
the improvement in the net interest margin in from of basis points  which occurred despite the unfavorable interest rate yield curve during  was principally attributable to a reduction of basis points in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities due  in large part  to lower deposit costs 
the higher net interest margin also reflected growth in the yield on average interest earning assets to for from for contributing to the increase in the yield were favorable changes in the interest earning asset mix and higher yields on securities  partially offset by a basis point reduction in the yield on average loans 
the favorable changes in the interest earning asset mix included a shift to loans from mbs  which have historically provided lower yields than the company s loans 
average loans increased billion year to year and represented of average total interest earning assets for  up from for average mbs declined billion year to year and represented of average total interest earning assets for  down from for the reduction in the yield on average loans for  as compared with  was principally due to the lower long term interest rate environment during  partially offset by sales of certain relatively lower yielding portfolio loans during that year

non interest income general 
non interest income amounted to million for  up from million for  which followed a increase from million for although net gains on sales activities declined million in from  non interest income rose million year to year as growth was experienced in all other non interest income categories 
the significant increase in non interest income in  as compared with  was predominantly due to the full year effect of the namc acquisition

loan servicing and production fees amounted to million for  an increase of million  or  from such fees were million for  representing growth of million  or  from the prior year 
loan servicing fees increased to million for from million for and million for as a result of growth in the mortgage loan servicing portfolio  as well as changes in its characteristics 
loan production fees amounted to million for  as compared with million for and million for the decline in loan production fees in  as compared with  was due to the unfavorable effect on residential real estate loan production  particularly loan refinancing activity  of the relatively higher long term interest rate environment during the increase in loan production fees in from was attributable to a higher level of residential real estate loan production resulting from the relatively lower long term interest rate environment that existed during and the company s expansion of its residential real estate loan production capabilities 
the company s portfolio of mortgage loans serviced for others excluding loans being subserviced by the company amounted to billion at year end  as compared with billion one year earlier and billion at the end of this portfolio consists substantially of residential real estate loans  the underlying weighted average coupon rates of which were  and at december   and  respectively

in connection with its sales of mortgage servicing rights  the company was subservicing billion of loans at december   as compared with billion at the end of and billion at the end of the company receives fees for subservicing loans until the transfer of the servicing responsibility to the purchasers of the mortgage servicing rights 
banking service fees 
banking service fees totaled million for  up from million for  which had increased from million for these increases were reflective of higher transaction volumes  changes in the company s fee structure and the introduction of certain fee based services 
contributing to the growth in the level of transactions in  as compared with  was the impact of certain of the company s acquisitions during the higher volume of transactions in  as compared with  was partially due to an expanded network of automated teller machines 
securities and insurance brokerage fees 
securities and insurance brokerage fees were million for  higher than the level in the previous year 
this increase was primarily associated with sales of annuity and insurance products 
for  securities and insurance brokerage fees amounted to million  up from million for this growth was largely driven by an million increase in insurance fees  principally due to the expansion of the company s insurance product line and the number of states in which the products are sold as a result of the namc acquisition pursuant to which the company also acquired namc s insurance subsidiaries 
net gains on sales activities 
net gains on sales activities amounted to million for in comparison  net gains on sales activities were million for and million for net gains on sales of loans held for sale totaled million for  down from million for  which had increased from million for the net gains during were reduced by losses of approximately million associated with certain relatively lower yielding loans that were transferred from loans receivable to loans held for sale in connection with a balance sheet restructuring initiative 
sales of loans held for sale amounted to billion during  down billion from  primarily due to the effect on loans held for sale production of the relatively higher long term interest rate environment during during  sales of loans held for sale amounted to billion  up from billion during this increase  while largely attributable to the company s expanded mortgage banking operations  also reflected the significant loan refinancing activity that resulted  in large part  from the relatively lower long term interest rate environment during securities related net gains losses were million for  as compared with million for and million for the net gains during were substantially associated with sales of billion of securities  including virtually all of the billion of mbs that had been designated for sale in connection with the transfer of the company s entire securities held to maturity portfolio to its securities available for sale portfolio as part of a balance sheet restructuring initiative implemented in december at that time  the company recognized a loss of million associated with the write down to estimated fair value of those mbs designated for sale with unrealized losses which contributed substantially to the securities related net losses recognized in  but subsequent movements in interest rates resulted in higher than initially anticipated sales prices

all other net gains losses amounted to million for  million for and million for the net losses during were largely associated with the termination of certain derivative financial instrument agreements 
other 
other non interest income was million in  as compared with million in and million in the year to year increases were largely associated with income derived from a bank owned life insurance program  in connection with which the company made investments of million during the fourth quarter of and million during the third quarter of in general  under this program  the company purchases  owns  and is the beneficiary of insurance policies on the lives of certain employees who consent to being covered under the program in order to help defray certain costs associated with the company s employee benefit plans 
non interest expense general 
non interest expense amounted to million for  an increase of million  or  from the expense growth reflects increases in amortization of mortgage servicing assets and goodwill  together with higher general and administrative g a expense  primarily associated with the company s mortgage banking operations and acquisitions completed during during  non interest expense was million  up million  or  from this increase was largely the result of the full year effect of the namc acquisition  coupled with the company s expansion of its mortgage banking operations during in furtherance of its strategy in this area at that time and in response to the relatively high level of loan demand during that year 
g a expense 
g a expense amounted to million for this compares with million in and million in compensation and employee benefits expense totaled million for  an increase of million  or  from the prior year  which was primarily due to a higher average number of full time equivalent employees ftes 
the growth in average ftes was largely associated with the company s mortgage banking operations  as well as acquisitions consummated during average ftes associated with the company s mortgage banking operations increased during  as compared with the prior year  due to a higher level of ftes during the first half of during the second half of  in response to the slowing of residential real estate loan production  the average number of mortgage banking ftes was decreased significantly 
compensation and employee benefits expense increased to million for from million for  largely reflective of the company s expansion of its mortgage banking operations  primarily due to the namc acquisition  and to a much lesser extent  higher levels of commissions and incentives and normal merit increases 
the company s complement of ftes numbered  at the end of  down from  one year earlier  which had increased from  at the end of the decline during was substantially attributable to a reduction in the mortgage banking related ftes of approximately  or  the impact of which was partially offset by staff additions attributable to acquisitions during the growth in  as compared with  was largely associated with the company s expansion of its mortgage banking operations 
occupancy and equipment expense was million for  up million  or  from this increase was largely due to a rise in rent expense as a result of a higher average level of residential real estate loan production facilities  acquisitions consummated during and normal rental increases 
the overall increase in rent expense was mitigated  to a limited degree  by the reduction in the company s residential real estate loan production operations during the second half of as a result of the keybank branch acquisition and the lakeview acquisition  the company s banking branch network grew during and totaled branches at the end of also contributing to the year to year increase in occupancy and equipment expense  although to a lesser extent  was higher depreciation and amortization expense associated with  among other factors  technology related initiatives and acquisitions consummated during occupancy and equipment expense totaled million for  up million  or  as compared with this increase was largely associated with the company s expanded mortgage banking operations  particularly as a result of the namc acquisition  but also reflects  among other factors  the effects of technology related initiatives 
other g a expense declined million  or  in  as compared with contributing significantly to the decline  which occurred despite the effect of acquisitions during  was a reduction in the expense associated with the company s plan to prepare its computer systems  software  applications  hardware and facility systems to properly process dates beyond december  the year plan  which is further described under the heading year issue below 
other g a expense rose million  or  in  as compared with  largely due to the company s business expansion efforts

amortization of mortgage servicing assets amounted to million for  an increase of million from this increase was largely reflective of growth in the average balance of mortgage servicing assets  the effect of which was partially offset by a slowing of prepayment activity of the loans underlying the mortgage servicing assets portfolio in response to the comparatively higher long term interest rate environment during amortization of mortgage servicing assets increased to million for from million for this increase was also largely due to growth in the average balance of mortgage servicing assets  but  to a lesser extent  also reflected the impact of accelerated prepayments of the underlying loans that resulted from the relatively lower long term interest rate environment in the company was not required to recognize impairment of its mortgage servicing assets during  or at december   the company s mortgage servicing assets including related derivative financial instruments hedging such assets had a carrying value of million and an estimated fair value of  million 
in a declining long term interest rate environment  actual or expected prepayments of the loans underlying the company s mortgage servicing assets portfolio may increase  which could have an adverse impact on the value of such assets 
in connection therewith  the company uses certain derivative financial instruments to hedge its mortgage servicing assets see asset liability management derivative financial instruments 
in addition  the company has periodically consummated bulk sales of mortgage servicing rights in an effort to reduce the prepayment risk associated with its mortgage servicing assets portfolio 
the amount of mortgage servicing rights sold in such sales amounted to billion in  billion in and billion in amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill was million in  up million from the prior year as a result of acquisitions consummated during amortization of goodwill increased to million in from million in  primarily due to the namc acquisition 
restructuring and related expense 
in connection with the namc acquisition  the company incurred restructuring and related expense of million during no such expense was incurred during or income tax expense income tax expense for was million  up million from as a result of an increase in the effective income tax rate  coupled with higher pre tax income 
income tax expense rose to million in from million in due to growth in pre tax income  the effect of which was partially offset by a decline in the effective income tax rate 
the company s effective income tax rate was in  as compared with in and in the effective income tax rate in was favorably affected by a restructuring of assets within the legal entities that comprise the company s affiliated group 
extraordinary items during  and  the company recognized after tax extraordinary losses of million  million and million  respectively  on the early extinguishment of certain relatively higher costing long term debt 
on a pre tax basis  these losses amounted to million in  million in and million in year issue during  the company successfully completed the implementation  testing and validation of year capable versions of all of its mission critical systems and experienced no significant operational problems during the rollover to the year to date  the company has not experienced any significant issues relating to the inability of its computer systems  or the computer systems of its significant third party contractors  to properly process dates beyond december  the company will continue to monitor its mission critical systems throughout the year management  however  does not expect that any significant problem related to the year issue will occur 
cumulatively  since commencing its year efforts in  the company has incurred approximately million of pre tax expense in connection with its year plan 
the company currently anticipates that it will not incur significant additional expense relating to the year plan 
the total expense substantially reflects consulting fees associated with software remediation  project management and programming  as well as ancillary items  but does not include such items as the cost of company personnel involved in the year plan or capital expenditures that would have been made regardless of the issues associated with the impending year asset liability management general the company s asset liability management is governed by policies that are reviewed and approved annually by the boards of directors of the holding company and dime fsb  which oversee the development and execution of risk management strategies in furtherance of these policies 
the asset liability management committee  which is comprised of members of the company s senior management  monitors the company s interest rate risk position and related strategies 
market risk in general  market risk is the sensitivity of income to variations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rates or prices  such as prices of equities 
the company s market rate sensitive instruments include interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments 
the company enters into market rate sensitive instruments in connection with its various business operations  particularly its mortgage banking activities 
loans originated  and the related commitments to originate loans that will be sold  represent market risk that is realized in a short period of time  generally two to three months 
the company s primary source of market risk exposure arises from changes in united states interest rates and the effects thereof on mortgage prepayment and closing behavior  as well as depositors choices interest rate risk 
changes in these interest rates will result in changes in the company s earnings and the market value of its assets and liabilities 
the company does not have any material exposure to foreign exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
movements in equity prices may have an indirect  but limited  effect on certain of the company s business activities or the value of credit sensitive loans and securities 
interest rate risk management the company manages its interest rate risk through strategies designed to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate exposure throughout a range of interest rate environments 
these strategies are intended not only to protect the company from significant long term declines in net interest income as a result of certain changes in the interest rate environment  but also to mitigate the negative effect of certain interest rate changes upon the company s mortgage banking operating results 
the company seeks to contain its interest rate risk within a band that it believes is manageable and prudent given its capital and income generating capacity 
as a component of its interest rate risk management process  the company employs various derivative financial instruments 
the company s sensitivity to interest rates is driven primarily by the mismatch between the term to maturity or repricing of its interest earning assets and that of its interest bearing liabilities 
historically  the company s interest bearing liabilities have repriced or matured  on average  sooner than its interest earning assets 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk arising from the option risk embedded in many of the company s interest earning assets 
for example  mortgages and the mortgages underlying mbs may contain prepayment options  interim and lifetime interest rate caps and other such features affected by changes in interest rates 
prepayment option risk affects mortgage related assets in both rising and falling interest rate environments as the financial incentive to refinance a mortgage loan is directly related to the level of the existing interest rate on the loan relative to current market interest rates 
extension risk on mortgage related assets is the risk that the duration of such assets may increase as a result of declining prepayments due to rising interest rates 
certain mortgage related assets are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than others  resulting in a higher risk profile 
because the company s interest bearing liabilities are not similarly affected  the gap between the duration of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities generally increases as interest rates rise 
in addition  in a rising interest rate environment  adjustable rate assets may reach interim or lifetime interest rate caps  thereby limiting the amount of their upward adjustment  which effectively lengthens the duration of such assets 
lower interest rate environments may also present interest rate risk exposure 
in general  lower interest rate environments tend to accelerate loan prepayment rates  thus reducing the duration of mortgage related assets and accelerating the amortization of any premiums paid in the acquisition of these assets 
the amortization of any premiums over a shorter than expected term causes yields on the related assets to decline from anticipated levels 
in addition  unanticipated accelerated prepayment rates increase the likelihood of potential losses of net future servicing revenues associated with the company s mortgage servicing assets 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk resulting from certain changes in the shape of the yield curve particularly a flattening or inversion also called yield curve twist risk of the yield curve and to differing indices upon which the yield on the company s interest earning assets and the cost of its interest bearing liabilities are based basis risk 
as further described below  in evaluating and managing its interest rate risk  the company employs simulation models to help assess its interest rate risk exposure and the impact of alternate interest rate scenarios  which consider the effects of adjustable rate loan indices  periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment caps  estimated loan prepayments  anticipated deposit retention rates and other dynamics of the company s portfolios of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
derivative financial instruments the company currently uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to assist in managing its interest rate risk exposures 
while the company s use of derivative financial instruments in managing its interest rate exposures has served to mitigate the unfavorable effects that changes in interest rates may have on its results of operations  the company continues to be subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk management instruments 
the company s assets have historically repriced or matured at a longer term than the liabilities used to fund those assets 
at december   the company used the following derivative financial instruments in its efforts to reduce its repricing risk i interest rate swaps  where  based on the notional amount of the related agreement  the company makes fixed rate payments and receives variable rate payments  all of which are tied to the one or three month london interbank offered rate libor  ii interest rate cap corridors  where  in exchange for the payment of a premium to the counterparty  the company receives the amount by which one month libor exceeds a specified strike rate up to a maximum rate  as applied to the notional amount of the related agreement  and iii interest rate futures  where the company pays any increase  or receives any decrease  in the market value of the underlying financial instrument 
the following table sets forth the derivative financial instruments used by the company at december  for interest rate risk management purposes  segregated by the activities that they hedge dollars in thousands weighted average estimated notional fair fixed rate variable rate amount value payable receivable interest rate swaps hedging securities available for sale   loans receivable   short term borrowings   interest rate cap corridors hedging securities available for sale   loans receivable   interest rate futures hedging securities available for sale  loans receivable  total   variable rates receivable are presented on the basis of rates in effect at december   however  actual repricings of the interest rate swaps will be based on the applicable interest rates in effect at the actual repricing dates

at december   the company used the following derivative financial instruments to protect against the adverse impact on the value of the company s mortgage servicing assets of substantial declines in long term interest rates and the consequent increase in mortgage prepayment rates i interest rate floors  where  in exchange for the payment of a premium to the counterparty  the company receives the excess of a specified strike rate over a designated market interest rate generally constant maturity treasury or swap indices  as applied to the notional amount of the related agreement  ii interest rate swaps  where the company receives a fixed rate and pays a variable rate tied to one or three month libor  iii interest rate swaptions  where  in exchange for the payment of a premium to the counterparty  the company  at a future date  has the right to enter into interest rate swap agreements  and iv principal only swaps  where the company a receives the discount realized on the underlying principal only security and pays a variable rate based on one month libor as applied to the notional amount of the agreement  and b pays or receives changes in the market value of the underlying principal only security 
two major classes of derivative financial instruments were used by the company at december  to hedge the risk in its loans held for sale and related commitment pipeline 
to the extent that the company estimates that it will have loans to sell  the company sells loans into the forward mbs market
