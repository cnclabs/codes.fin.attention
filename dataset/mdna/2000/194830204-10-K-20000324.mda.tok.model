the certificates represented the right to receive payments generated by the receivables held by the trust 
availability under the variable funding certificates at any time depended primarily on the amount of receivables generated by the sellers from sales to the automotive industry  the rate of collection on those receivables and other characteristics of those receivables which affect their eligibility such as the bankruptcy or downgrading below investment grade of the obligor  delinquency and excessive concentration

net cash provided by the continuing operating activities of the company was million for in  the company implemented a new compensation program  based in part upon maximizing cash flow and increasing asset utilization 
this new focus resulted in a reduction in working capital including accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable to million in  compared to million in the company s principal uses of funds from operating activities and borrowings for the next several years are expected to fund interest and principal payments on its indebtedness  net working capital increases and capital expenditures

the company currently anticipates that its capital expenditures for continuing operations for fiscal will be in the range of to million  a portion of which may be financed through leasing 
the company s capital expenditures in future years will depend upon demand for the company s products and changes in technology 
the company is sensitive to price movements in its raw material supply base 
during fiscal  prices for most of the company s primary raw materials remained constant with price levels at december  while the company may not be able to pass on future raw material price increases to its customers  it believes that a portion of the increased cost can be offset through value engineering value analysis in conjunction with its major customers and by continued reductions in the cost of off quality products and processes 
the company has significant obligations relating to postretirement  casualty  environmental  lease and other liabilities of discontinued operations 
in connection with the sale and acquisition of certain businesses  the company has indemnified the purchasers and sellers for certain environmental liabilities  lease obligations and other matters 
in addition  the company is contingently liable with respect to certain lease and other obligations assumed by certain purchasers and may be required to honor such obligations if such purchasers are unable or unwilling to do so 
on january   imperial home decor group  inc  which purchased wallcoverings in march   filed voluntary petitions for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the company is currently assessing the impact of that bankruptcy filing 
management currently anticipates that the net cash requirements of its discontinued operations will be approximately million in fiscal however  because the requirements of the company s discontinued operations are largely a function of contingencies  it is possible that the actual net cash requirements of the company s discontinued operations could differ materially from management s estimates 
management believes that the company s cash needs relating to discontinued operations can be provided by operating activities from continuing operations and by borrowings under its credit facilities 
tax matters at december   the company had outstanding net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
substantially all of these nols expire over the period from to the company also has unused federal tax credits of approximately million  million of which expire during the period to future sales of common stock by the company or its principal shareholders  or changes in the composition of its principal shareholders  could constitute a change in control that would result in annual limitations on the company s use of its nols and unused tax credits 
management cannot predict whether such a change in control will occur 
if such a change in control were to occur  the resulting annual limitations on the use of nols and tax credits would depend on the value of the equity of the company and the amount of built in gain or built in loss in the company s assets at the time of the change in control  which cannot be known at this time 
management has reviewed the company s operating results for recent years as well as the outlook for its continuing businesses in concluding it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of million at december  will be realized 
a major goal of the reorganization is to lower the overall cost structure of the company and thereby increase profitability 
these factors along with the timing of the reversal of its temporary differences and the expiration dates of its nols were also considered in reaching this conclusion 
the company s ability to generate future taxable income is dependent on numerous factors  including general economic conditions  the state of the automotive industry and other factors beyond management s control 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will meet its expectation of future taxable income 
the valuation allowance at december  provides for certain deferred tax assets that in management s assessment may not be realized due to tax limitations on the use of such amounts or that relate to tax attributes that are subject to uncertainty due to the long term nature of their realization 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that i affect ongoing operations and may increase capital costs and operating expenses and ii impose liability for the costs of investigation and remediation and otherwise relate to on site and off site contamination 
the company s management believes that it has obtained  and is in material compliance with  all material environmental permits and approvals necessary to conduct its various businesses 
environmental compliance costs for continuing businesses currently are accounted for as normal operating expenses or capital expenditures of such business units 
in the opinion of management  based on the facts presently known to it  such environmental compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or future results of operations 
the company is legally or contractually responsible or alleged to be responsible for the investigation and remediation of contamination at various sites 
it also has received notices that it is a potentially responsible party prp in a number of proceedings 
the company may be named as a prp at other sites in the future  including with respect to divested and acquired businesses 
the company is currently engaged in investigation or remediation at certain sites 
in estimating the total cost of investigation and remediation  the company has considered  among other things  the company s prior experience in remediating contaminated sites  remediation efforts by other parties  data released by the united states environmental protection agency  the professional judgment of the company s environmental experts  outside environmental specialists and other experts  and the likelihood that other parties which have been named as prps will have the financial resources to fulfill their obligations at sites where they and the company may be jointly and severally liable 
under the theory of joint and several liability  the company could be liable for the full costs of investigation and remediation even if additional parties are found to be responsible under the applicable laws 
it is difficult to estimate the total cost of investigation and remediation due to various factors including incomplete information regarding particular sites and other prps  uncertainty regarding the extent of environmental problems and the company s share  if any  of liability for such problems  the selection of alternative compliance approaches  the complexity of environmental laws and regulations and changes in cleanup standards and techniques 
when it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of the company s liability with respect to environmental sites  provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as of december   excluding sites at which the company s participation is anticipated to be de minimis or otherwise insignificant or where the company is being indemnified by a third party for the liability  there are sites where the company is participating in the investigation or remediation of the site  either directly or through financial contribution  and additional sites where the company is alleged to be responsible for costs of investigation or remediation 
as of december   the company s estimate of its liability for these sites  is approximately million 
as of december   the company has established reserves of approximately million for the estimated future costs related to all its known environmental sites 
in the opinion of management  based on the facts presently known to it  the environmental costs and contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or future results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company has identified or properly assessed all potential environmental liability arising from the activities or properties of the company  its present and former subsidiaries and their corporate predecessors 
impact of year compliance the company has currently not experienced any significant systems or other year problems 
the company s comprehensive plan to address year issues the year plan included the acceleration of the company s business systems integration plan the bsip plan

the total cost of the company s year plan  including million of costs associated with the bsip plan  was million 
included in this amount is million of salaries and other payroll costs of company employees to the extent that they devoted a portion of their time to the project

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to modify the risk from these interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company enters into various hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to policies and procedures 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate exposure the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s long term debt obligations 
the interest rate exposure for the company s variable rate debt obligations is currently indexed to libor  for us denominated debt  or the canadian bankers acceptance rate  for canadian denominated debt  of one  two  three or six months  as selected by the company 
while the company has used interest rate swaps and other interest rate protection agreements to modify its exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing rates  no such agreements were in place at december  the table below provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the company s debt obligations 
weighted average variable interest rates are based on implied libor and canadian bankers acceptance forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  which is the company s reporting currency 
the instrument s actual cash flows are denominated in both us dollar us and canadian dollar cad  as indicated in parentheses dollar amounts in thousands 
expected maturity date fair value december  thereafter total debt fixed rate us     average interest rate variable rate us         average interest rate variable rate cad    average interest rate currency rate exposure the company is subject to currency rate exposure primarily related to foreign currency purchase and sale transactions and intercompany and third party loans 
the primary purpose of the company s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with these foreign currency exposures 
the company primarily utilizes forward exchange contracts and purchased options with durations of generally less than months 
on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union the participating countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the participating countries have agreed to adopt the euro as their common currency on that date 
the conversion did not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
at december   the company had the following foreign currency forward contracts outstanding i british pounds for euros with a us dollar equivalent notional amount of million  a weighted average contract rate of euros and an unrealized loss of million and ii euros for swedish krona with a us dollar equivalent notional amount of million and a weighted average contract rate of krona 
these contracts mature in the information presented does not fully reflect the net foreign exchange rate exposure of the company because it does not include the intercompany funding arrangements denominated in foreign currencies and the foreign currency denominated cash flows from anticipated sales and purchases 
management believes that the foreign currency exposure relating to these items would substantially offset the exposures discussed above 
the company also had option contracts with a us dollar equivalent notional amount of million outstanding at december  with a weighted average strike price of canadian 
these contracts allow the company s canadian operations to buy us dollars for canadian dollars 
these contracts expire periodically in
