tuition revenue generally varies based on the average tuition charge per credit hour and the average student population 
student supply store and housing revenue is largely a function of the average student population 
the average student population is influenced by the number of continuing students attending school at the beginning of a fiscal period and by the number of new students entering school during such period 
new students enter the art institutes at the beginning of each academic quarter  which typically commence in january  april  july and october

regulation the company indirectly derived approximately of its net revenues from title iv programs in us department of education regulations prescribe the timing of disbursements of funds under title iv programs 
students must apply for a new loan for each academic year 
lenders generally provide loan funds in multiple disbursements each academic year 
for first time students in their first academic quarter  the initial loan disbursement is generally received at least days after the commencement of that academic quarter

these restrictions have not significantly affected the company s ability to fund daily operations 
education institutions participating in title iv programs must satisfy a series of specific standards of financial responsibility 
the us department of education has adopted standards to determine an institution s financial responsibility to participate in title iv programs 
the regulations establish three ratios i the equity ratio  measuring an institution s capital resources  ability to borrow and financial viability  ii the primary reserve ratio  measuring an institution s ability to support current operations from expendable resources  and iii the net income ratio  measuring an institution s profitability 
each ratio is calculated separately  based on the figures in the institution s most recent annual audited financial statements  and then weighted and combined to arrive at a single composite score 
such composite score must be at least for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without conditions or additional oversight 
regulations promulgated under the hea also require all proprietary education institutions to comply with the rule  which prohibits participating schools from deriving or more of total revenue from title iv programs in any year
