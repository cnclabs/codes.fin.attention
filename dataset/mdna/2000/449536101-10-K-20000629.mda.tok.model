see item  legal proceedings 
operating costs and expenses 
product costs were million of product sales for fiscal compared to million of product sales for fiscal the change in product cost margins is attributable to a change in product sales mix between instruments  services and reagents related to the m series product launch 
operating costs  excluding product costs  increased to million in fiscal compared to million during fiscal during fiscal  research and development costs increased million to million from million in fiscal this increase was due to higher personnel and development expenses primarily associated with development of the m series system and related assays  development of additional instrumentation for the m series line of products to meet the expanding needs of the drug discovery and development market  and research and development expenses associated with the mesoscale diagnostics msd joint venture 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million over the prior year s total of million 
this increase was due primarily to professional and legal fees associated with the company s litigation with roche and higher sales and marketing costs related to the launch of the m series system 
interest and other expense 
interest expense  net of other income  increased million in fiscal due to interest on higher debt balances during the year 
the company completed a million debt financing in march and issued million of convertible debentures in january the company also recorded as interest  non cash charges of million in fiscal related to the beneficial conversion element of the convertible debentures and related warrants  of which million was non recurring 
net loss 
excluding the non cash charge of million per share taken to account for the beneficial conversion element of the convertible debentures and related warrants issued in january  the net loss was million per share in fiscal including the non cash charge  the net loss was million per share 
this compares with a net loss of million per share for fiscal the convertible debentures had a one time beneficial conversion feature measured as the difference between the conversion price and the fair value of the company s common stock at the time of the issuance of the debentures 
results of operations in the future are likely to fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter as a result of factors  which include the volume and timing of orders for m series or other products  the timing of instrument deliveries and installations  variations in revenue recognized from royalties and other contract revenues  the mix of products sold  whether instruments are sold to or placed with customers  the timing of the introduction of new products  competitors introduction of new products  variations in expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the business  including legal fees  research and development costs and sales and marketing costs  manufacturing capabilities  and the volume and timing of product returns and warranty claims 
during fiscal  the company received notice from roche that royalty payments due to the company are now being reduced through an additional deduction from sales on which the royalty is based 
roche has also claimed that the company owes it million in royalties previously paid to the company as a result of a retroactive application of this deduction back to the company has notified roche that it objects to this latest calculation which it does not believe is in accordance with the agreement 
roche has notified the company that it does not intend to collect this retroactive amount pending ongoing settlement discussions between the company and roche 
there can be no assurances that roche will not unilaterally seek to collect this claim by withholding unrelated future royalty payments from the company 
in the event that roche should do so  the company s results of operations would be adversely affected for the period or periods in which the royalty payments are withheld 
the company has experienced significant operating losses each year since inception and expects those losses to continue 
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development and from litigation costs  selling costs and other general and administrative costs 
the company expects to incur additional operating losses as a result of increases in expenses for manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities  research and product development and general and administrative costs 
the company s ability to become profitable in the future will depend  among other things  on its ability to expand the commercialization of existing products  introduce new products into the market  develop marketing capabilities cost effectively  and develop sales and distribution capabilities cost effectively 
as of march   the company had net operating loss and general business credit tax carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively

royalties from roche represent approximately million of the total royalty income for fiscal as compared to approximately million for fiscal operating costs and expenses

interest and other expense 
interest income  net of other expense  increased approximately  in fiscal from higher cash balances and the reduction of interest expense associated with the advance royalty agreement with roche  which was repaid during the first quarter of fiscal net loss

for fiscal  future minimum lease payments for which the company is obligated under capital lease agreements approximate  including interest and facility and equipment operating lease commitments approximate million 
the company has also committed to future capital contributions under the msd joint venture of million 
the company believes material commitments for capital expenditures may be required in a variety of areas  such as product development programs 
the company has not  at this time  made commitments for any such capital expenditure or secured additional sources to fund such commitments 
the company has no reason to believe that the existence of the roche litigation is having a material adverse effect on roche s sales pursuant to the agreement or that a negative result for the company in the roche litigation would have a material adverse effect on roche s sales  although there can be no assurance that the litigation or its outcome would not have such an effect 
as it now stands  roche has the right to continue to market its elecsys products to central hospital laboratories and clinical reference laboratories during the term of the agreement unless and until the company is determined to have the right to terminate the agreement and then determines to terminate the agreement 
if the company elects to terminate the agreement  it would have a material adverse effect on the company s royalty revenue from the license sales unless and until the company entered into a strategic partnership with another company that is able to develop and commercialize diagnostic instruments for central hospital laboratories and clinical reference laboratories 
there can be no assurance  if the company decided to terminate the agreement that the company would be able to enter into such a strategic partnership on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
the company does not expect that failure to prevail in the hitachi litigation by itself would have a material adverse effect on the company s revenue or sales  since hitachi would continue to manufacture roche instruments and the company would continue to earn royalties in connection therewith 
there can be no assurance that the hitachi litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the company s intellectual property  regardless of whether the outcome of the litigation is favorable or not 
success by the company in the hitachi litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company s royalty revenues from sales of elecsys products to the extent that roche s sales of elecsys instruments are hindered because it needs to find a new manufacturer for its instruments or make arrangements to have hitachi manufacture the instruments outside of japan 
the company has a substantial amount of indebtedness  and there is a possibility that it may be unable to generate cash or arrange financing sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on and other amounts due with respect to indebtedness when due  or in the event any of it is accelerated 
in addition  substantial leverage may require that the company dedicate a substantial portion of its expected cash flow from operations to service indebtedness  which would reduce the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
the company needs substantial amounts of money to fund operations 
access to funds could be negatively impacted by many factors  including the results of pending litigation  the volatility of the price of the company s common stock  continued losses from operations and other factors 
the company anticipates that existing capital resources  together with revenue from product sales  will be adequate to fund our operations through the middle of the calendar year the company may need to raise substantial amounts of money to fund a variety of future activity integral to the development of its business 
the company may try to raise necessary additional capital by issuing additional debt or equity securities 
if the company is unable to raise additional capital  it may have to scale back  or even eliminate  some programs 
alternatively  it may have to consider pursuing arrangements with other companies  such as granting licensees or entering into joint ventures
