seasonality and other factors there are certain seasonal factors that may affect the company s business 
traditionally  manufacturing businesses in italy close for the month of august  and the company s domestic hosiery customers close for one week in july 
consequently  no shipments or deliveries  as the case may be  of machines distributed by the company that are manufactured in italy are made during these periods which fall in the company s first quarter 
in addition  manufacturing businesses in italy generally close for two weeks in december  during the company s second quarter 
fluctuations of customer orders or other factors may result in quarterly variations in net revenues from year to year 
effects of inflation and changing prices management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations 
disclosure about foreign currency risk generally  speizman industries purchases of foreign manufactured machinery and spare parts for resale are denominated in italian lira 
currency fluctuations of the lira could result in substantial price level changes and therefore impede or promote import export sales and substantially impact profits 
the company is not able to assess the quantitative effect that such currency fluctuations could have upon the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not have a significant adverse effect on speizman industries future operations 
in the ordinary course of business and as part of the company s risk management programs  the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements between the lira and the us dollar for both anticipated and firm purchase commitments 
the contracts have maturity dates that do not generally exceed months 
substantially all of the increase or decrease of the lira denominated purchase price is offset by the gains and losses of the foreign exchange contract 
because these contracts qualify as hedges for accounting purposes  the gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the results of operations in the period in which the hedge transaction is consummated 
the company does not hold or issue foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
at july   the company had contracts maturing through february to purchase approximately billion lira for approximately million  for which the market value at that date if terminated was million 
the company anticipates that it will utilize all outstanding forward contracts in the ordinary course of business in fiscal year although the company is unable to quantify the effects on its results  the company believes that this utilization will have an adverse effect on its results for fiscal year the company is also reviewing its risk management strategy and is considering other alternatives for mitigating foreign currency risk in the future

 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the statement requires the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is a hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in comprehensive income equity until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is recognized in earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
the company attempts to reduce these risks by utilizing financial instruments  pursuant to company policies 
the value of the us dollar affects the company s financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect the company s revenues as expressed in us dollars  cost of sales  gross margins  operating expenses  and retained earnings 
where the company deems it prudent  it engages in hedging those transactions aimed at limiting in part the impact of currency fluctuations 
as discussed in the foreign currency risk section above  the company purchases forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with the company s anticipated and firm commitments of lira dominated purchases for resale 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of the company s programs include volatility of the currency markets  and availability of hedging instruments 
all currency contracts that are entered into by the company are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation 
although the company maintains these programs to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against the lira in which the company has anticipated purchase commitments  the company s gross margins could be adversely affected if future sale prices cannot be increased because of market pressures 
the company is also subject to interest rate exposure on million of debt outstanding at july  that was priced at interest rates that float with the market
