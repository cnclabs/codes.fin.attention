item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview a substantial part of our growth has been achieved through acquisitions 
from july  through december   we completed acquisitions  including acquisitions of companies accounted for as pooling of interest transactions 
given the significant number of acquisitions in each of the periods presented  the results of operations from period to period may not necessarily be comparable 
during the year ended december   we completed mergers the mergers with the companies listed below the pooled companies in transactions accounted for as poolings of interest 
these mergers provided for exchange of substantially all the outstanding equity interests of such companies for shares of our common stock 
shares of infocure company issued macon systems management  llc  the parent of medical software management  inc  omsystems  inc  ardsley  mis  inc mis  medfax corporation  scientific data management  inc  datamedic holding corp 
 kevin kozlowski  inc d b a human touch software  unident corporation  infologic  inc  prism data systems  inc  cdl healthcare systems  inc  because the mergers were accounted for as poolings of interests  the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report have been retroactively restated to reflect them 
the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report have also been retroactively restated to reflect the acquisition of radiology management systems  inc radman in a transaction that was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
as a result  the financial position  results of operations and cash flows are presented as if radman and the pooled companies had been consolidated for all periods presented see notes to consolidated financial statements 
infocure has historically derived revenue primarily from licensing new software products and software upgrades  reselling hardware components in connection with a portion of its software sales and providing customer support and services 
customer support and services typically have been provided pursuant to renewable annual contracts or on a fee basis 
we have derived additional revenue from customers and third party clearinghouses by providing electronic data interchange services through contractual arrangements with such parties 
approximately of our total revenue is recurring in nature 
infocure bases its revenue recognition policies for sales of software on the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
revenue from software sales is recognized upon shipment in instances where infocure has evidence of a contract  the fee charged is fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
revenue from hardware sales is recognized upon product shipment 
revenue from support and maintenance contracts  which are typically one year in length  is recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
revenue from other services is recognized as the services are provided 
depreciation and amortization expense results primarily from the amortization of goodwill  which represents the excess of the consideration paid by infocure over the fair value of the net assets acquired in acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
as of december   our balance sheet included goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  of million 
goodwill is amortized over its estimated useful life  which had previously been years 
in the fourth quarter of  management determined that the estimated useful life of goodwill should be shortened substantially to be more reflective of the current rate of technological change and competitive conditions within the marketplace 
accordingly  management changed the estimated useful life of goodwill from years to three years 
this change in accounting estimate is applied prospectively from the fourth quarter of and increased amortization expense by approximately million 
future amortization expense is estimated to total approximately million per year 
depreciation and amortization expense also includes depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of software development costs 
property and equipment are assigned depreciable lives ranging from three to years 
software development costs are expensed until technological feasibility is achieved 
costs incurred after achievement of technological feasibility and before general release are capitalized and amortized  generally over a four year life 
costs incurred after general release are expensed as incurred 
as discussed below  during the fourth quarter of infocure adopted a new product strategy to begin development of asp delivered products and  as a result  recorded a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of representing the write off of the carrying value of software development costs for certain medical specialty products 
change in product strategy and business model infocure is currently reorganizing its business to facilitate changes in its pricing of practice management software products  its delivery of these products and the scope of its product offerings 
during the fourth quarter of  infocure acquired five companies that provide dental practice management solutions  increasing infocure s number of dental customers by approximately  practices 
these acquisitions  along with infocure s determination that there is a natural segregation of infocure s business into medical and dental specialties  have caused infocure to divide its business into a medical division and a dental division 
the medical division consists of infocure s business for general medical practices and medical specialty practices in the areas of anesthesiology  dermatology and plastic surgery  emergency medicine  oncology  ophthalmology  pathology  pediatrics  podiatry and radiology 
the dental division consists of the portion of infocure s business that serves dental  orthodontic and oral and maxillofacial surgery practices 
as part of the reorganization  infocure intends to transfer the assets of its medical division to vitalworks  inc  a newly formed subsidiary of infocure 
vitalworks intends to develop new practice management software applications that can be delivered through the application services provider  or asp  delivery model 
in the asp delivery model  vitalworks would remotely host applications from an offsite central server which physicians would access over dedicated lines  virtual private networks or the internet 
vitalworks also intends to offer its new practice management applications through installations directly in physicians offices as practice hosted systems 
additionally  vitalworks intends to offer internet solutions that will allow its customers to utilize the internet to enhance office workflow and conduct business to business e commerce 
vitalworks is continuing to develop its internet solutions and to establish strategic relationships to facilitate these product offerings 
as part the reorganization  infocure intends to transfer the assets of its dental division to practiceworks  inc  which will be a new subsidiary of infocure 
infocure intends for practiceworks to focus on development of internet solutions and asp delivered practice management applications that are tailored to the needs of the dental division s customers 
in particular  due to infocure s current penetration of the dental market and existing channels of distribution  infocure expects practiceworks to generate a significant amount of business to business e commerce in the dental market 
infocure expects practiceworks to begin offering its new solutions by the end of in connection with infocure s strategy to develop asp delivered products  infocure plans to convert to subscription based pricing for substantially all of its products and services 
under this subscription pricing model  customers will pay a fixed  monthly fee for use of infocure s practice management applications and internet solutions and the computer hardware necessary to utilize those applications and solutions 
this represents a change in infocure s historical pricing model in which customers were charged an initial licensing fee for use of practice management products and continuing maintenance  support and edi transaction fees 
infocure intends to begin offering substantially all of its products and services on the subscription pricing model in the second quarter of as a result of the transition to subscription pricing model  we expect to see a decline in one time revenue from software license fees and hardware sales  replaced over time by monthly subscription fees 
in addition  as we convert existing customers to our new subscription contracts  the recurring support and edi revenue from our installed customer base will gradually decline and will be replaced by increasing monthly subscription fee revenue 
we expect the percentage of our revenue that is recurring in nature to increase substantially as a result of this change 
in addition  we expect to eventually derive revenue from e commerce relationships with key suppliers of products and services in our markets 
this revenue will typically be in the form of a commission or royalty based on the value of products and services provided by our partners to our customers and will be recognized as it is earned 
because of our reorganization  our historical financial results are not expected to be representative of future results 
restructuring charges the plan 
in the fourth quarter of  infocure decided to restructure its business into a medical and a dental division  changed its product strategy to begin development of asp delivered products and internet solutions  decided to transition to a subscription pricing model in connection with its change in product strategy  and completed eight acquisitions  including five acquisitions which substantially increased its presence in the dental market 
concurrently  management committed to a plan of restructuring and reorganization  expected to be completed in the second quarter of  to consolidate facilities  eliminate staffing redundancies and position infocure to capitalize on its change of business model 
in the fourth quarter of  infocure recorded million in restructuring and other charges in connection with this plan 
the components of these charges are million representing carrying value of software development costs for medical specialty products  the estimated useful life of which is now considered minimal based on our change to an product strategy focused on development of asp delivered products  million representing facility closure and consolidation costs  including cancellation of leases and other contracts  million reflecting severance and other termination benefits for approximately employees representing certain redundant staff positions   reflecting contingent consideration deemed payable to former stockholders of entities affected by the restructuring   representing incremental costs associated with completion of discontinued customer contracts  and  representing other asset write downs and costs 
additional charges will be recorded in the first quarter of primarily to provide for costs associated with staffing reductions for our new dental division 
these personnel changes were finalized and communicated in the first quarter of accordingly  compensation costs  including severance and other termination benefits  aggregating approximately million will be recorded in the first quarter of the plans 
in  infocure adopted a plan to restructure its operations by consolidating existing facilities and acquired operations 
in connection with the restructuring plan  which was substantially completed in the second quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of and million was recorded in the first six months of additionally  datamedic  one of the pooled companies  incurred million in restructuring costs in representing severance and other costs associated with staff reductions resulting from a plan of reorganization adopted in and completed in change in fiscal year in the first quarter of  infocure changed its fiscal year end from january to december as a result  infocure s fiscal year beginning february  and ending on december  reflects eleven months of operations 
in process research and development on october   infocure acquired the assets of the healthcare systems division hsd of the reynolds and reynolds company 
in connection with the hsd acquisition  infocure retained an independent appraiser to complete a valuation of the assets of hsd  including valuation of certain in process research and development 
infocure identified three projects for which technological feasibility had not been achieved as of the acquisition date and for which there was no alternative future use 
the products included powerrmanager  a next generation physician practice management system  the year ready version of promed  a unix based practice management system  and the year ready version of kredo  a practice management system running on the ibm as platform 
based on the results of the appraisal  million was attributed to the in process research and development purchased in the hsd acquisition and was expensed in the fourth quarter of results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated eleven year ended months december  ended december  revenue systems and software maintenance  support and services total revenue operating expense hardware and other items purchased for resale selling  general and administrative excluding compensatory stock awards research and development depreciation and amortization compensatory stock awards purchased research and development restructuring and other charges merger costs total operating expense operating income loss other expense income interest  net other  net loss before income taxes and extraordinary item income tax expense benefit loss before extraordinary item year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to total revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  primarily reflects the completion of the hsd acquisition effective october and overall growth in the business 
the mergers  which are accounted for as poolings of interests  are reflected retroactively for all periods presented 
systems and software revenue was million for the year ended december   or of total revenue  while maintenance  support  and service revenue was million  or of total revenue for the same period 
hardware and other items purchased for resale 
hardware and other items purchased for resale consist of costs incurred to purchase hardware  and include costs of forms and postage  outsourced hardware maintenance  third party software and other items for resale in connection with sales of new systems and software 
the costs required to install such systems and to perform software maintenance and support services are reported in selling  general and administrative expenses 
hardware and other items purchased for resale increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the hsd acquisition completed in october for the year ended december   gross margin  which represents total revenue less hardware and other items purchased for resale  was of total revenue  compared to of total revenue  for the year ended december  this decline in gross margin is attributable primarily to a change in the mix of revenues resulting from the growth in hardware maintenance revenues and statement processing revenues  which generally carry lower margins

selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase reflects primarily additional marketing and administrative personnel and other selling and administrative costs necessary to support the consolidated businesses of the acquired companies 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  primarily to the fact that seven of the eight companies acquired in the fourth quarter of had selling  general and administrative expenses that were substantially higher in relation to their revenues than ours 
five of these companies were pooling transactions  therefore  their results of operations are included as if they had been consolidated for all periods 
as all of these companies were acquired in december  cost savings measures resulting from their integration have not yet been reflected 
additionally  management deferred certain planned staff reductions in connection with the reorganization of the business into the medical and dental divisions and its change in product strategy 
further  during the fourth quarter of  the allowance for doubtful accounts increased by million to more closely align the allowance with collection experience and to provide additional coverage as part of the announced change to a subscription pricing model 
research and development 
research and development expenses consists primarily of salaries and benefits  supplies  facilities and other administrative expense associated with making enhancements to existing products and the development of new products 
research and development expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due primarily to a higher proportion of software development costs qualifying for capitalization in as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expense decreased to of total revenue for the year ended december  from of total revenue for the year ended december  we capitalize development costs incurred from the time a new product reaches technological feasibility until it is available for general release 
capitalized software development costs were million for and million for the higher level of capitalized costs in is reflective of the state of development of a variety of projects  including new e commerce applications 
in conjunction with the change in product strategy  development efforts will be concentrated on development of asp delivered products and internet solutions and no additional costs will be capitalized for other medical specialty products

compensatory stock awards expense decreased million  or  to million for december  from million for the year ended december  the amount included approximately million in non cash charges related to the accelerated vesting of a restricted stock award for  shares granted to three executives in the million in related to contingently exercisable stock options of omsystems  a pooled company 
under the terms of omsystems stock option agreement  the value of the options became determinable in the fourth quarter of  resulting in recognition of compensation expense 
as a percentage of total revenue  compensatory stock awards expense decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  purchased research and development 
purchased research and development expense was million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  this expense represents charges related to the write off of certain in process research and development costs associated with the hsd acquisition

income taxes benefit 
the provision for income taxes was  for the year ended december   compared to a benefit of million for the year ended december  the effective income tax rate for the year ended december   is higher than statutory rates due to state income taxes and permanent differences resulting primarily from the amortization of nondeductible goodwill 
in addition  the effective tax rate for differs from the statutory tax rate due to the more significant impact of poolings with certain s corporation entities that incurred no federal income taxes prior to their acquisition by us

the benefit for income taxes was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the eleven months ended december  liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements have been to fund acquisitions working capital capital expenditures for buildings  furniture  fixtures and equipment and capitalized software development costs 
we have met our liquidity needs over the last three years through funds provided by operating activities  equity offerings and long term borrowings 
on february   infocure completed the private placement of  shares of series a preferred stock  resulting in gross proceeds to us of million and net proceeds of approximately million after payment of selling commissions to the placement agent for the offering and other expenses of the offering 
we granted to the placement agent a warrant to acquire  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
our consolidated financial statements reflect an accretive dividend attributable to the preferred stockholders in the amount of  with respect to the issuance costs and the fair market value of the warrant related to the series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock automatically converted into  shares of common stock upon the completion of our public offering in april on september   infocure completed the sale of  shares of common stock for million in a private placement to an institutional investor 
the investor committed to invest an additional million  which must be invested from time to time at our request in our sole discretion and subject to certain price and trading volume limitations  upon the exercise of put options through march  subsequently  infocure completed the sale of  shares of common stock for million in december and the sale of  shares of common stock for million in january on october   in connection with the hsd acquisition  infocure delivered to the reynolds and reynolds company a million  five year  convertible promissory note  bearing interest per annum at rates commencing at and increasing each year to a maximum of 
the note was convertible at our option during the first year of the term into common stock at a price based on the price of the common stock in an underwritten public offering or the average market value of the common stock over a period of time prior to the conversion date 
in addition  infocure delivered to the reynolds and reynolds company a million subordinated promissory note payable within days of the closing of the hsd acquisition 
in october  we finalized certain negotiations related to the hsd acquisition and exercised our conversion option related to the convertible promissory note by issuing approximately  shares to convert approximately million of this note 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the conversion  we incurred an obligation to pay approximately million because the conversion shares were sold at a price below the conversion price 
we have the option to settle this obligation by issuing additional shares of our common stock 
on april   infocure completed a public offering of million shares of common stock at per share  which generated net proceeds of million 
infocure applied million of the proceeds of this offering to retire the principal outstanding on its credit facility 
the balance of the proceeds was applied toward working capital and for general corporate purposes 
on may   infocure issued approximately million shares of common stock at per share for net proceeds of million relating to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option in connection with the public offering 
the proceeds from the over allotment were applied toward working capital and for general corporate purposes 
our deferred revenue and customer deposits decreased approximately million to million at december  from million at december  net of a million increase from acquisitions 
a significant portion of this decrease is attributable to changes in billing cycles for maintenance agreements 
maintenance agreements are billed to customers annually  quarterly and monthly 
as we have integrated our various acquisitions  we have systematically moved customers to monthly billing cycles 
this change results in less deferred revenue and improved cash flow potential but no overall change in maintenance revenue 
during the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operating activities primarily relating to non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and extinguishment of debt costs and non operating restructuring and other charges  which are offset by the impact of increased investment in working capital  primarily an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in deferred revenue and customer deposits 
during  cash used in investing activities was million  consisting primarily of cash used for acquisitions of million  capital expenditures of million and intangible asset costs of million 
the principal intangible asset expenditures included cash paid for contingent consideration for previous acquisitions  capitalized software development costs and purchased technology 
during the year ended december   we generated net cash from financing activities of million  including million net proceeds from issuance of common stock and million proceeds from the line of credit and other long term debt 
these proceeds were principally used to retire outstanding debt of million  fund the acquisition of the purchased companies see notes and to consolidated financial statements and to fund capital purchases  primarily a building 
our commercial credit facility  with an aggregate availability of million  was repaid in full with proceeds of our april public offering 
the early retirement of debt resulted in a write off of previously paid deferred loan costs in the amount of approximately million and prepayment penalties of approximately  in august  we obtained a new five year credit facility in the amount of million 
the credit facility provides for an million term loan and a million revolving loan that converts to a term loan in october the credit facility bears interest at rates ranging from prime plus to  or libor plus to  depending on our achieving certain debt service ratios  and is collateralized by substantially all of infocure s assets 
at december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million and million outstanding under our line of credit 
we expect the transition to a subscription pricing model will adversely impact our cash flow until revenue from subscription fees replaces revenue from software license fees and hardware sales 
we also expect to incur increased marketing and sales expenses in connection with offering our asp delivered products and internet solutions 
we expect to finance this restructuring and future acquisitions  if any  through one or more of the following sources our credit facility  other indebtedness and the issuance of debt or equity securities by us or one of our subsidiaries 
the sale of equity securities  including investments convertible into equity securities  may result in further dilution to existing stockholders 
there can be no assurance that additional sources of capital will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we believe that our existing cash and anticipated future operating cash flow  combined with availability of funds under the credit facility and other sources of financing  will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop was effective for financial statements for years beginning after december  sop provides guidance over accounting for computer software developed or obtained for internal use  including the requirement to capitalize specified costs and amortization of such costs 
adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our capitalization policy 
financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
historically  the company has not entered into derivatives contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes 
accordingly  the company does not expect adoption of this new standard on january   to affect its financial statements 
costs related to year compliance infocure recognized the material nature of the business issues surrounding computer processing of dates into and beyond the year and took corrective action prior to december  in order to make its products year compliant and to help its customers to make their systems that use our products year compliant  infocure offered its customers various alternative forms of products and assistance  including generally available year information and diagnostic tools  software patches  product upgrades or replacement products 
prior to the year  infocure discontinued the sale and support of products that it did not believe would be year compliant and attempted to notify all known users of these products of its belief that those products were not year compliant 
infocure also believes that it completed all of the activities within its control to ensure that its internal software and hardware systems were year compliant during the fiscal year  and infocure has experienced no material interruptions to operations due to the start of the year infocure s total year compliance costs were approximately million  of which approximately  were incurred in infocure does not currently expect to apply additional material funds to address year issues 
as of march   infocure is not aware of any material disruption in the operation of its products by its customers as a result of year issues 
in addition  as of march   infocure has not experienced any material disruptions of its internal computer systems or software applications  and has not experienced any material problems with the computer systems or software applications of the third parties with whom it regularly does business as a result of year issues 
although infocure s year rollover did not present any material business disruption  there are some remaining year related risks 
infocure s management believes that appropriate action has been taken to address these remaining year issues and contingency plans are in place to minimize the financial impact to infocure 
in addition  infocure will continue to monitor the third parties with whom it regularly does business to determine if they will take appropriate action to address the remaining year issues 
infocure  however  cannot be certain that year issues will not have a material adverse effect on its business  since the evaluation process is not yet complete and it is early in the year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships ie prime to libor spreads 
approximately million of our outstanding debt at december  relates to a five year financing agreement with finova capital corporation 
interest on the outstanding balance is charged based on a variable rate related to prime rate or  at our option  the libor rate 
both rate bases are incremented for margins specified in the agreement 
thus  our interest rate is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase across all maturities of variable rate debt would result in a decrease of approximately  in pre tax net income assuming no further changes in the amount of borrowings subject to variable rate interest from amounts outstanding at december  we do not trade in derivative financial instruments
