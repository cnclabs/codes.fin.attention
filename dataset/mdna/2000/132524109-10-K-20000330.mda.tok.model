prior to this realignment  the company s services had been organized in six service lines since october cambridge management consulting  customer management solutions  interactive solutions  custom software solutions  enterprise resource solutions  and network services 
the company provides the majority of its services on a fixed time  fixed price model  with client involvement at all stages of the process 
for software development services  the company and its clients generally agree on a contractually fixed price for each phase of a project 
the company only includes in backlog that stage of the software deployment process for which it has obtained a signed contract 
accordingly  backlog does not reflect revenues expected in future periods 
in performing its services  the company brings together key client users  executives  and it professionals in interactive sessions to achieve consensus on the business case  strategic objectives  and functionality of a business solution 
in many cases  the company employs a rapid deployment methodology that features an iterative approach 
the company believes that these techniques permit the delivery of results in rapid time frames typically within three to twelve months

the dollar and percentage decrease in eintegration revenues is attributed to lowered demand for the company s client server solutions and erp package software implementations due to an increased number of clients opting to defer or cancel strategic information technology initiatives in favor of completing year prevention and remediation activities 
revenues for change management increased slightly 
north american revenues decreased in compared to  while international revenues grew in compared to north american revenues for represent of total revenues while international revenues represent of total revenues for the same period 
for  north american revenues represent of total revenues while international revenues represent of total revenues for the same period 
the international revenue growth resulted from increased demand for the company s services in europe  latin america  and asia pacific 
the decrease in north american revenues is attributed to lowered demand for the company s client server solutions and erp package software implementations due to an increased number of clients opting to defer or cancel technology initiatives in favor of completing year remediation activities and higher than expected employee turnover 
employee turnover was approximately  excluding forced turnover  for compared to approximately  excluding forced turnover  for the company  along with the rest of the technology industry  continues to be challenged by employee turnover as companies compete for employees with the skill sets required to fulfill client demand 
company headcount was approximately  at december  compared to approximately  december  the company continues to assess the skill sets necessary to address the changing market dynamics and focuses on training  hiring  and assimilating appropriate personnel to service its clients 
results of operations to facilitate comparisons  the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues and the period to period percentage changes for revenues  costs and expenses  and income from operations 
years ended december  percentage increase decrease to to revenues costs and expenses project personnel general and administration sales and marketing other costs business combination costs total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes historically  a majority of the company s revenues have been recognized using the percentage of completion method  which requires revenues to be recorded over the term of a client contract based on the percentage of expenses incurred to total project expenses 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates of the percentage of work completed is reflected in the fiscal quarter in which the revision becomes known 
the company s operating results may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates of contract completion costs 
although the company from time to time is required to make revisions to its work completion estimates  to date  none of these revisions has had a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
inaccuracies in future work completion estimates could result in a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
losses expected to be incurred on projects in progress are recognized when known 
revenues related to time and materials engagements are recognized when services are performed 
a major portion of the company s services are provided on a fixed price basis and  therefore  the company bears the risk of cost overruns 
client project margins and personnel utilization are critical components of the company s financial performance 
the company regularly reviews staff compensation and overhead costs to ensure that its services are properly priced 
in addition  management continuously monitors the progress of client projects 
the company attempts to manage its personnel utilization rates by closely monitoring project timetables and staffing requirements for new projects 
because the company s client engagements are generally terminable without substantial client penalty  an unanticipated termination of a client project could require the company to maintain or terminate under utilized employees  resulting in a higher than expected number of unassigned employees or severance expenses 
while the level of professional staff may be adjusted to reflect active projects  the company must maintain a sufficient number of senior professionals to oversee existing client projects and participate with the company s sales force in securing new client assignments 
recent developments the company announced that it will continue to transition the organization to a provider of ebusiness solutions 
however  the skill sets required to deliver e business solutions are in high demand  and the issues surrounding turnover and slowdown in the erp implemenation services are expected to continue 
the company announced that it therefore expects to continue to incur losses in the first half of based on flat revenue compared to the first half of the prior year  and the need to make strategic investments to fund the company s growth 
even with total revenues expected to be flat in the first half of  cambridge expects continued growth in its e business revenues

the company maintains a million unsecured senior revolving credit facility the facility through a syndication arrangement committed equally by the chase manhattan bank chase and fleet national bank fleet bank 
the facility  which expires on september   is administered by chase and carries a commitment fee  payable quarterly in arrears  calculated based on the unused portion of the facility and a price grid as set forth in the credit agreement

for the year ended december   the company was in compliance with the debt to capital and net worth ratio requirements but  for the quarter ended december   was not in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio 
the company received a waiver through march  regarding the non compliance with the debt service coverage ratio 
the company is in the process of renegotiating the terms of the facility 
as of december   the company had no balance outstanding under the facility 
the fund was formed in october as a limited partnership with committed capital of approximately million 
the fund s goal is capital appreciation and is intended to invest in expansion stage  private companies 
a wholly owned subsidiary of the company acts as the general partner of the fund s general partner and the company s investment is accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
the company s capital commitment to the fund is approximately million 
at december   the company s cumulative capital contribution to the fund amounted to approximately million

however  the company s strategy to transition its business to internet oriented solutions could place a strain on the company s financial resources 
the company anticipates that existing cash and investment balances combined with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the facility will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital requirements for at least the next months and to fund the transition of the company s business 
operating results and liquidity may be adversely affected if market demand and revenues do not increase as anticipated 
as the company expands its international operations  a number of factors  including market acceptance of the company s services  significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and changes in general economic  political  or regulatory conditions could also adversely affect future results and liquidity 
the year issue the year issue results from computer programs written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
in addition to the company s internal systems  the company relies on third party relationships in the conduct of its business 
for example  third party vendors handle the payroll function for the company  and the company also relies on the services of landlords of its facilities  telecommunication companies  banks  utilities  and commercial airlines  among others 
in addition  the failure on the part of the accounting systems of the company s clients due to the year issue could result in a delay in the payment of invoices issued by the company for services and expenses 
the company has recommended  implemented and customized various third party software packages for its clients  certain of which may not be year compliant 
because the company has designed  developed and implemented software and systems for a large number of clients since  there can be no way of assuring that all such software programs and systems will be year compliant 
there also can be no assurance that the contractual protections  if any  obtained by the company will operate to protect the company from  or limit the amount of  any liability arising from claims asserted against the company 
to date  the company s software and services have not revealed any significant year problems 
as of march   the company has not experienced any significant issues as a result of year problems and does not anticipate incurring material incremental costs in future periods due to such issues

the accounting for changes in fair value  recorded as a gain or loss  depends on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation 
the statement initially was to be effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activites deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no

forward looking statements this form k includes forward looking statements statements that are not historical facts  including  without limitation statements about future net revenues and profits  capital expenditures  liquidity sources and needs  working capital needs  e business initiatives undertaken in response to customer demand and anticipated market growth oppotunities  estimated costs for additional retention programs  the company s efforts to retain  retrain  relocate  and strategically redeploy employees  the company s hiring efforts  increases in personnel and wages for the company s personnel  the impact of varying compensation arrangements  geographic expansion and opening additional offices  and litigation involving the company 
these forward looking statements are subject to several risks and uncertainties 
while it is impossible to identify each factor and event that could affect the company s results  there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements and that could have an impact on the company s operating results 
these factors include  without limitation o risks associated with the company s transition to an e business company  including the orientation of new management teams within the new structure and the need to develop reliable forecasting tools for each e business service offering  o the success of the company s human resources repositioning and retention programs  o employee hiring  retention  billability and utilization  o the number and significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a period  o the number of working days in a period  o the company s ability to manage its growth  o the company s ability to manage the cost of its engagements and operating costs  o changes in demand for the company s services and third party products or solutions for which the company performs integration services  o future initiatives in an attempt to adapt to changing market dynamics  o estimated costs for additional retention programs  o changes in market conditions that could impact the value of securities owned by the company or the company s investment in the cambridge technology capital fund i  o turnover in senior management  o competition  o risks associated with international operations  o the acceptance and profitability of the company s services in new locations  o the integration of acquired businesses  o unanticipated negative outcomes of litigation involving the company  and o misappropriation of  or lack or loss of protection of  the company s intellectual property 
the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because the company s sales cycle is relatively long in the case of new clients and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of client assignments and general economic conditions 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments  particularly at or near the end of any quarter  can cause significant variations in operating results from period to period 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates due to investments in instruments made for non trading purposes 
the interest rate risk relates primarily to the company s portfolio of short term investment grade municipal securities 
the company is also subject to risk relating to fluctuating interest rates to the extent that it incurs any borrowings under its credit facility 
the foreign exchange rate risk relates to the company s investment in foreign exchange contracts which are entered into in order to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates associated with intercompany balances 
the company believes that interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk are both immaterial to the company
