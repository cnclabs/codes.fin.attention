computer systems may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in product and or system failures or other computer errors causing disruption of the company s operations 
the company s year initiatives focused on the following areas of risk a the failure or disruption of systems used by the company to run its business operations and facilities  b the failure or disruption of systems used by the company s suppliers and vendors  c warranty or other claims by customers due to failure or malfunctioning of the company s products 
the company established a steering committee including senior executives to address year issues which report periodically to the board of directors 
the company s plan to address year issues resulted in the formation of three main teams a internal systems team  b external vendors suppliers team  and c product readiness team

during the transition period from january  through december   public and private entities as well as individuals may pay for goods and services using either checks  drafts  or wire transfers denominated in euro or the participating country s national currency

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company has a formal policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the policy permits the use of financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that may arise in the normal course of the company s business 
currently  the company does not use interest rate derivatives 
the counterparties in derivative transactions are major financial institutions with ratings of a or better  as determined by one of the major credit rating services 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
during  the principal transactions hedged were short term intercompany purchases 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans and the offsetting losses and gains on hedged transactions are reflected in the company s statement of earnings

the company  which manufactures nearly all of its products in the united states  generally invoices its international subsidiaries in their local currency for finished and semi finished goods

in an effort to offset potential year end yk liquidity problems  the company borrowed million equivalent in japanese yen to fund yen denominated firm purchase commitments or those that were expected to occur 
substantially all of the remaining company debt is us dollar denominated 
at year end  about percent of this indebtedness to third parties was floating rate based 
although the company has exposure to rising and falling rates  a percent rise in rates on the year end floating rate based borrowings would have had a  adverse impact on pre tax earnings 
during  the company did not use interest rate derivatives to protect its exposure to interest rate market movements
