item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the group owns two separate vehicle rental companies  dollar and thrifty 
they engage in the business of renting vehicles directly to retail and tour customers and providing vehicle leasing and other services to franchisees that rent to customers 
the majority of dollar s revenue is derived from renting vehicles to customers from company owned stores  while the majority of thrifty s revenue is generated from leasing vehicles and providing services to franchisees 
the group s revenues consist of o vehicle rentals revenue generated from renting vehicles to customers  including all related charges  through company owned stores  o vehicle leasing revenue generated from leasing vehicles to franchisees  o fees and services revenue generated from franchise fees and providing reservations  insurance  supplies and other products and services to franchisees  and o other revenue generated from franchise sales  parking income  non vehicle lease income and interest income derived from franchisees 
the group s expenses consist of o direct vehicle and operating costs related to the rental of revenue earning vehicles to customers and to the leasing of vehicles to franchisees  such as leasing expenses  concessions and commissions paid to airport authorities  travel agencies and others  insurance and lease promotion expenses  net of certain incentives received from vehicle manufacturers  o vehicle depreciation and lease charges  net depreciation expense relating to revenue earning vehicles  net of gains and losses on the disposal of such vehicles  and lease charges for vehicles leased from third parties  o selling  general and administrative expenses  including advertising and marketing expenses and reservation expenses  o interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest earned on restricted cash  cash and cash equivalents  relating primarily to revenue earning vehicle financing  and o amortization of cost in excess of net assets acquired 
the group s profitability is primarily a function of the volume and pricing of rental transactions  utilization of the vehicles and the number of vehicles leased to franchisees 
significant changes in the purchase or disposal price of vehicles or interest rates can also have a significant effect on the group s profitability  depending on the ability of the group to adjust the size of the fleet as well as pricing and lease rates for these changes 
the group s business requires significant expenditures for vehicles and consequently  requires substantial liquidity to finance such expenditures

interest rate risk the group s results of operations depend significantly on prevailing levels of interest rates because of the large amount of debt it incurs to purchase vehicles

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

many of the group s other operating expenses are also expected to increase with inflation 
management does not expect that the effect of inflation on the group s overall operating costs will be greater for the group than for its competitors 
year the year issue yk relates to potential problems with computer systems or any equipment employing technology that uses dates where the date has been stored as just two digits eg for 
any date recording mechanism within a computer system  including date sensitive software  which uses only two digits to represent the year may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year resulting in system failures or miscalculations causing a disruption of operations 
the group experienced no problems with its systems or disruption in service due to the failure of third parties or their independent franchisees to be yk compliant 
nevertheless  since it is impossible to anticipate all future outcomes  especially when third parties are involved  there can be no assurance that the group will not  in the future  experience disruptions in operations that could materially and adversely affect the group s business  results of operations  and financial condition in the future 
the group s costs to remediate yk issues were million 
certain information technology projects to enhance systems and improve operating efficiencies were delayed due to yk compliance efforts
