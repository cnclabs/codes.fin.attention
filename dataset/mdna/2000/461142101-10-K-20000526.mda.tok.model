item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosures regarding forward looking statements this report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this form k  including  without limitation  statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under business product strategy  business distribution  and notes to consolidated financial statements located elsewhere herein regarding the company s financial position  business strategy  plans and objectives of management of the company for future operations  and industry conditions  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
in addition to important factors described elsewhere in this report  the following significant factors  among others  sometimes have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause such results during fiscal  and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company o the company faces intense competition based on product capabilities and experiences ever increasing demands from its actual and prospective customers for its products to be compatible with a variety of rapidly proliferating computing  telephony and computer networking technologies and standards 
the ultimate success of the company s products is dependent  to a large degree  on the company allocating its resources to developing and improving products compatible with those technologies  standards and functionalities that ultimately become widely accepted by the company s actual and prospective customers 
the company s success is also dependent  to a large degree  on the company s ability to implement arrangements with other vendors with complementary product offerings to provide actual and prospective customers greater functionality and to ensure that the company s products are compatible with the increased variety of technologies and standards 
o continued availability of suitable non proprietary computing platforms and system operating software that are compatible with the company s products 
o certain of the components for the company s products are available from limited suppliers 
the company s operating results could be adversely affected if the company were unable to obtain such components in the future 
o increasing litigation with respect to the enforcement of patents  copyrights and other intellectual property 
o the ability of the company to retain its customer base and  in particular  its more significant customers  such as british telecom  which accounted for approximately of the company s total sales during fiscal  since such customers generally are not contractually obligated to place further orders with the company 
o legislative and administrative changes and  in particular  changes affecting the telecommunications industry  such as the telecommunications act of while many industry analysts expect the telecommunications act of ultimately to result in at least a temporary surge in the procurement of telecommunications equipment and related software and other products  there is no assurance that the company can estimate with sufficient accuracy those products which will ultimately be purchased  the timing of any such purchases or the quantities to be purchased 
o risks involved in the company s international distribution and sales of its products  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  unexpected changes in exchange rates  the difficulty and expense of maintaining foreign offices and distribution channels  tariffs and other barriers to trade  difficulty in protecting intellectual property rights  and foreign governmental regulations that may limit or restrict the sales of call automation systems 
additionally  changes in foreign credit markets and currency exchange rates may result in requests by many international customers for extended payment terms and may have an adverse impact on the company s cash flow and its level of accounts receivable 
o the quantity and size of large sales sales valued at approximately million or more during any fiscal quarter  which can cause wide variations in the company s sales and earnings on a quarter to quarter basis 
many of the company s contracts  particularly for managed services  foreign contracts and contracts with telecommunications companies  include liquidated damages provisions 
o ability of the company to properly estimate costs under fixed price contracts in developing application software and otherwise tailoring its systems to customer specific requests 
o the company s ability to hire and retain  within the company s compensation parameters  qualified technical talent and outside contractors in highly competitive markets for the services of such personnel 
o mergers and acquisitions between companies in the telecommunications and financial industries which could result in fewer companies purchasing the company s products for telecommunications and banking applications  and or delay such purchases by companies that are in the process of reviewing their strategic alternatives in light of a merger or acquisition 
o extreme price and volume trading volatility in the us stock market  which has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many high technology companies  frequently for reasons other than the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
o the ability of the company to successfully integrate the products  customers  employees and other business components of the former intervoice and the former brite in an efficient fashion 
o the company s business transactions in foreign currencies are subject to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
results of operations the following table presents certain items as a percentage of sales for the company s last three fiscal years

see discussion of fiscal in item  selected financial data 
had it not been impacted by adoption of sop  tightened credit practices  and special charges items including a charge for in process research and development  cost of goods sold  gross margin  research and development expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses  operating income and net income as a percentage of sales would have been    and  respectively 
sales sales are derived primarily from the shipment of call automation systems to both new and existing customers in two major market categories i ivr and crm systems and ii enhanced telecommunications services systems 
due to customer demand  many of the company s transactions are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
the size and timing of some transactions have historically resulted in sales fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
in the past  the impact of these fluctuations has been mitigated to some extent by vertical markets and by the geographic location of the company s existing and prospective customers 
however  the company has become more prone to quarterly sales fluctuations due to its sales to the enhanced telecommunications services systems market which are generally large in dollar amount and unevenly distributed throughout the fiscal year 
effective december  the company adopted the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop 
prior to the adoption of sop  the company s policy provided for the recognition of revenue upon shipment  provided that the company s remaining obligations relating to system installation and testing were not significant 
with sop  contract accounting was adopted for systems that require significant customization or modification by the company 
revenue for contracts for large systems  generally greater than  in sales value  is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
revenue for smaller systems is recognized on the completed contract method  ie  when all the company s obligations have been met 
the adoption of sop resulted in the company not recognizing revenue in the same fiscal quarter that certain systems are shipped 
the adoption of sop also resulted in the company recognizing revenue during a fiscal quarter from systems shipped in previous fiscal periods 
accordingly  the adoption of sop delayed by to days the company s recognition of approximately million in sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the first fiscal quarter of adoption 
the adoption of sop did not result in a material increase or decrease in the company s aggregate sales during fiscal from time to time  the company has agreed to amend customer purchase orders to extend normal payment terms in exchange for accelerating delivery and installation of systems  particularly systems not requiring customization 
the company tightened this practice in its fourth quarter of fiscal to improve cash flow 
this decision resulted in an approximate million decrease to revenues during the quarter and fiscal year 
the company continued its tightened practices during its fiscal with the merger with brite in fiscal  the company now generates a significant percentage of its sales outside the united states  particularly sales of enhanced telecommunications services systems 
customers outside the united states are accustomed to vendor financing in the form of extended payment terms 
to remain competitive in markets outside the united states  the company may offer its most credit worthy customers such payment terms 
in fiscal  customer extended payment terms had no material adverse impact on the company s days sales outstanding dso s of accounts receivable 
however  there is no assurance such extended payment terms will not adversely impact dso s in fiscal and beyond 
during december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in the financial statements 
implementation of guidance prescribed in the bulletin and which all registrants are expected to apply  may result in a change in the company s revenue recognition policy as applied to a portion of the company s system sales from the date of shipment to the date of transfer of title or final acceptance which may therefore have the effect of later revenue recognition 
because the company has complied with generally accepted accounting principles for its historical revenue recognition  the change in its revenue recognition policy resulting from sab will be reported in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal which ends august  any consequent deferral of revenue for shipments previously reported as revenue which had not been accepted by customers as of february  would result in a cumulative adjustment in the first quarter of fiscal this adjustment might have a material adverse effect on reported net income for periods reported after february  the company is still in the process of assessing the detailed impact of sab on its financial statements 
however  implementation of sab will not affect the fundamental aspects of the company s operations as measured by its shipments and cash flows 
the company is also considering potential changes to its standard contracts for equipment sales that could mitigate the impact of sab with respect to future sales 
worldwide sales in fiscal and increased and  respectively and declined in fiscal the increase in fiscal sales is primarily due to the company s merger with brite which was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
results of brite s operations have been consolidated with those of intervoice effective june   the first day of the company s second fiscal quarter 
the increase in fiscal sales was primarily the result of a increase in ivr crm system sales  which made up of the company s total sales  and a increase in enhanced telecommunications services systems sales  which made up of the company s total sales 
sales of services during fiscal grew at a slower rate and made up of the company s total sales 
the decline in fiscal sales was primarily the result of a decrease in ivr crm system sales  which made up of the company s total sales and a decrease in enhanced telecommunications services systems  which made up of the company s total sales 
sales of services during fiscal grew slightly and made up of the company s total sales 
to enhance comparability of the company s sales for fiscal  and  the information below is also presented on an as adjusted basis as though the merger with brite had occurred at the beginning of the respective period presented in millions 
as adjusted as reported ivr crm systems enhanced telecommunications services systems services total intervoice brite s fiscal year ends the last day of february 
brite s fiscal year ended december no adjustment has been made to account for the two companies different fiscal year ends 
as adjusted amounts do not include sales by brite s tsl and bep divisions  which were sold december  and october   respectively 
the following discussion compares sales performance on an as adjusted basis ivr crm system sales decreased in fiscal the decline in such sales was attributable to a sluggishness in demand for the former brite customer base as those companies evaluated the company s product roadmap resulting from the merger with brite 
additionally  these sales were impacted by a sluggish fourth quarter demand as the company s existing and prospective customers deferred purchase decisions until after the turn of the century yk 
such sales increased in fiscal as a result of the company s continued investment in product development  expansion of its distribution channels and its marketing and advertising programs  and in the hiring and training of new and existing sales  service and support personnel 
ivr crm sales decreased in fiscal as a result of a poor pacific rim environment and a concentration of the company s latin american sales efforts on telecommunications opportunities 
international ivr crm system sales constituted  and of the company s total ivr crm system sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
enhanced telecommunications services systems sales increased  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases were attributable to the company s investments in product development  expansion of its distribution channels and its marketing and advertising programs  and hiring and training of new and existing sales  service and support personnel 
international enhanced telecommunication services system sales constituted  and  of the company s total enhanced telecommunications services systems sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
services sales increased  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the large increase in fiscal was attributable to the company s managed services sales 
the company provides certain voice and call processing services to its customers on systems owned and operated by the company 
in return  the company charges its customers in one of many ways including fixed rates per month or per transaction or and share of the revenue generated by the company s customers based on such services 
during fiscal  managed services sales increased as a result of increased call volumes by customers offering prepaid cellular calling services in europe and north america 
generally  the company receives a portion of the prepaid cellular calling revenues generated by its customers 
international services sales constituted  and of the company s total services sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
prices for the company s products have remained stable  as measured by price per line shipped  during fiscal  and although the features and functions per line shipped have become more robust 
the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is minimal as less than of total sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
cost of goods sold fiscal cost of goods sold was of total sales 
during the second fiscal quarter  the company incurred charges of  in the aggregate  million of a non recurring nature 
these charges include a charge related to a comprehensive patent cross license agreement with an affiliate of lucent technologies  inc  a provision for inventories made redundant as a result of the merger with brite  and a provision for the impairment of certain intangible assets relating to the company s esp product line made obsolete as a result of the merger with brite 
without these charges  cost of goods sold  as a percentage of total sales  would have been during fiscal  compared to and during fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in cost of goods sold  as a percentage of sales  during fiscal is attributable to the company s merger with brite which  historically  has had a greater cost of goods sold  as a percentage of sales  than the company due to higher third party hardware content in its systems than in the company s systems 
the decrease in fiscal was the result of increased sales  the absence of non recurring expenses and the company s efforts to control costs and expenses 
fiscal cost of goods sold included approximately million of non recurring expenses recorded in the fourth quarter for inventory obsolescence and the impairment of certain intangible assets relating to third party software development costs 
research and development research and development expenses during fiscal were approximately million 
such expenses included a million charge for in process research and development  see in process research and development below  incurred during the second quarter in connection with the brite merger 
net of this charge  research and development expenses were approximately million during fiscal such expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal in such expenses is the result of the company s merger with brite 
such recurring expenses during fiscal  and included the design of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
the company expects to maintain its strong commitment to research and development to remain at the forefront of technology development in its business segments  which is essential to the continued improvement of the company s position in the industry 
in process research and development during the second quarter of fiscal  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of brite in a two step transaction involving aggregate consideration of approximately million of cash and  shares of the company s common stock 
brite provides voice processing and call processing systems and services which incorporate prepaid postpaid applications  voice response  voice recognition  voice facsimile messaging  audiotex and interactive computer applications into both standard products and customized market solutions 
approximately million was paid in cash  and approximately million was paid in company common stock 
the company s consolidated statements of operations reflect the results of operations of brite beginning june  the merger has been accounted for as a purchase business combination 
the aggregate purchase price for brite was approximately million  which includes other direct costs and assumed liabilities relating to the merger 
other direct costs of the merger and assumed liabilities primarily consisted of employee termination costs  transaction costs and costs associated with the elimination of excess facilities 
the purchase price has been allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values which were determined by an independent valuation and by the company s management based on information furnished by management of brite 
the allocation of the purchase price is as follows in millions working capital property and equipment other assets other liabilities identified intangible assets purchased in process r d expensed deferred tax liability on identified intangibles goodwill identified intangibles include developed technology million  customer relationships million  assembled workforce million  and trade name million 
identified intangibles and the excess of cost over net assets acquired ie goodwill are being amortized on a straight line basis over years and years  respectively 
in process r d of million was expensed at the time of acquisition as the company determined that the in process r d had not reached technological feasibility based on the status of design and development activities that required further refinement and testing 
brite s in process r d related to technologies which support brite s interactive voice response ivr computer telephony integration cti  intelligent network  messaging  voice dialing  and prepaid postpaid product families 
the valuation of existing product technology and in process r d was performed using the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows  and risks associated with achieving such cash flows 
the income approach focuses on the income producing capability of the existing products and in process r d projects and best represents the present value of the future economic benefits expected to be derived 
significant assumptions used in the valuation of in process r d included the stages of completion of r d projects  projected operating cash flows  and the discount rate 
at the time of the merger  brite management estimated the remaining cost to complete the in process r d projects to be approximately million with a remaining time requirement of approximately months 
projected operating cash flows were expected to begin in fiscal the discount rate selected for brite s in process technologies was 
if the r d projects are not successfully developed  the company may not realize the value assigned to the in process r d 
as of february   development of the projects had progressed as planned with remaining costs to complete estimated at million 
during fiscal  the company wrote off as in process research and development approximately million of the purchase price paid to integrated telephony products  inc for its esp product line 
in addition to acquiring the esp product line and certain other assets of integrated telephony products  inc the company acquired two in process research and development projects i call flow and ii internet telephony interfaces 
call flow was a project to develop a windows nt  gui based telecommunications application development tool 
internet telephony interfaces was a project to develop interfaces to allow text and voice messaging over the internet which will enable an end user to access voice messages  text messages such as email and faxes either through traditional telecommunications networks with text messages and faxes being read to the end user using text to speech technology or through the internet 
the amount allocated to the purchased research and development projects million was expensed at the time of acquisition as the company determined that the purchased research and development projects had not reached technological feasibility based on the status of design and development activities that required further refinement and testing 
to determine the fair market value of the in process research and development projects  the company used a risk adjusted income approach  whereupon fair market value is a function of the future revenues expected to be generated by an asset  net of all allocable expenses 
in determining the amount of the purchase price to allocate to the purchased research and development  factors such as stage of completion and technological uncertainties were considered by the company in determining the present value of the future benefits to be received 
the development activities required to complete the acquired in process research and development projects included additional coding  cross platform porting and validation  quality assurance procedures and beta testing 
at the time of purchase  the estimated future cost of completing these activities was expected to be approximately million to be incurred over the next months 
actual costs incurred during fiscal were approximately million 
revenue streams from the resulting products were expected to begin in fiscal and were projected forward for five years in the risk adjusted income analysis 
a discount rate of was used to determine the present value of the cash flows related to the in process research and development projects which resulted in million of assigned value 
during the second quarter of fiscal  a provision was made to recognize the obsolescence of the esp product line as a result of the company s merger with brite 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million during fiscal such expenses include non recurring charges totaling million  including a provision for severance for employees of the company prior to the merger with brite made redundant to the company s staffing plan as a result of the merger  travel expenses associated with developing the plans for merging the operations of the company with those of brite  a charge to bad debt expense relating to the impairment of certain foreign accounts receivable and another charge to bad debt expense relating to the cancellation of certain customer equipment trade in obligations 
such expense  net of these charges  was approximately million in fiscal and million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in these expenses is attributable to the company s merger with brite 
during fiscal  the company undertook measures to control expenses  particularly selling  general and administrative expenses see discussion below in income loss from operations  resulting in a million reduction in such expenses versus fiscal during fiscal  the company continued to hire and train new and existing sales  service and support personnel and expand its marketing and advertising programs worldwide  despite lower than anticipated sales 
amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets was approximately million for fiscal goodwill and intangible assets acquired in the merger with brite totaled approximately million with useful lives ranging from to years 
the company incurred no such expenses during fiscal or fiscal other income other income during fiscal  and was primarily interest income on cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense interest expense of approximately million was incurred during fiscal substantially all of this expense relates to the company s long term borrowings obtained during the second quarter in connection with the merger with brite see liquidity and capital resources for a description of the company s long term borrowings 
interest expense was approximately million during fiscal income taxes the company s income tax expense for fiscal differs significantly from the federal statutory rate primarily due to non deductible charges during the period relating to in process r d and amortization of goodwill resulting from the merger with brite 
income loss from operations the company generated operating income of million and a net loss of million during fiscal during fiscal  the company generated operating income of million and net income of million 
the company incurred an operating loss and a net loss during fiscal of million and million  respectively 
in order to understand the company s operating and net income over the last three fiscal years  it must be noted that the company incurred  during second quarter of fiscal  the previously mentioned special charges reported in cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses totaling million and million  respectively 
in addition  the company incurred a charge of million for in process research and development relating to its merger with brite 
also  the company  during fiscal  incurred special charges of approximately million reported in cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses including the following severance expenses associated with certain personnel matters  including the resignation of the company s former president and chief operating officer  write offs of certain accounts receivable to bad debt expense related to certain cancellations of service contracts and write offs of certain intangible assets as a result of the company s re examination of its product development and infrastructure requirements 
the company also provided a reserve for potential inventory obsolescence in light of efforts to migrate customers to its internally developed nsp computing platform from the company s traditional computing platforms  such as ibm ps computers 
as a result of such migration  the company reviewed its on hand supply of traditional computer platforms and determined that a provision for obsolescence was necessary to allow for a potential excess supply of traditional computer platforms 
additionally  the company wrote off as in process research and development approximately million of the purchase price paid to integrated telephony products  inc for its esp product line 
also impacting operating income in fiscal was the company s adoption of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop and a tightening of the company s credit practices to improve cash flow 
see item sales 
adjusting for the one time charges and other items discussed above  the company would have generated operating income of approximately million and approximately million in fiscal and  respectively  and net income of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal operating income and net income  versus the previous year  is primarily attributable to the company s merger with brite 
fiscal operating income increased over eleven times versus adjusted operating income in fiscal as the result of increased sales and the company s measures to control costs and expenses  particularly selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income  adjusted for the one time charges and other items discussed above  in fiscal decreased versus the previous fiscal year as the company increased its investment in sales  marketing  application engineering  and research and development resources without a corresponding increase in the company s sales 
these investments were made to continue to pursue opportunities in the cpe and telco markets 
fiscal net income increased over eight times versus adjusted net income in the previous fiscal year  and net income  adjusted for the one time charges and other items discussed above  in fiscal decreased versus the previous fiscal year for the same reasons as operating income 
liquidity and capital resources the company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents at february   while borrowings under the company s credit facilities were million 
borrowing under the credit facilities were paid down to million on march  the sum of investment activities consisting of the merger with brite and purchase of fixed assets and third party software  financing activities consisting primarily of the borrowings to finance the merger with brite and the effect of exchange rates on cash resulted in a use of cash of approximately million 
net income plus non cash expense items totaled million while an increase in operating assets totaled million to yield an operating cash flow of million during fiscal days sales outstanding dso s of accounts receivable continue to be a focus for the company 
at february   dso s were days  approximately the same as at february  cash used in investment activities totaled approximately million during fiscal and included the merger with brite and purchases of computing hardware and software to update the company s enterprise systems and to provide the information systems infrastructure needed to support the company s worldwide growth 
expenditures were also made to acquire test equipment and third party developed software to be integrated into the company s intersoft software to allow the company to offer its customers greater functionality and to ensure the company s products comply with an increasing variety of hardware and software technologies and standards 
financing activities during fiscal included an increase in the company s borrowings of million associated with the merger with brite 
other financing activities included the receipt of million as proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the pay down of million on the company s borrowings 
as a result of cash generated from operations and investment and financing activities  the company experienced an increase in its cash reserves of approximately million during fiscal the company believes its cash reserves and internally generated cash flow will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the company has access to the entire million available under its revolving credit facility 
the company reviews share repurchase and acquisition opportunities from time to time and believes it has access to the financial resources necessary to pursue attractive repurchase and or acquisition opportunities as they arise 
the term loan and revolving credit agreement discussed below includes normal and customary provisions which limit the company s ability to make such acquisitions 
in connection with the merger with brite  the company entered into a loan agreement with bank of america and nine other banks to provide a senior secured credit facility amounting to million  including a million term loan and a million revolving credit agreement 
the term loan agreement is subject to scheduled repayments  as defined  during the revolving credit agreement will expire upon the earlier of the termination of the term loan  or august  the cash required to service the facilities could have a material impact upon the operating cash requirements of the company for the foreseeable future 
at may   the company had borrowed million under the agreement  at an average annual interest rate of 
interest under the credit facility accrues at a variable rate indexed to the prime rate  the federal funds rate or an adjusted london interbank offering rate 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements with a total notional amount of million to change the characteristics of interest payments on its long term borrowings from libor based variable rate payments to fixed rate payments 
as of february   the variable rate of under the long term borrowings had been swapped for an effective rate of 
the effect of interest rate swaps on the company s interest expense during fiscal was immaterial 
the company s interest rate swap arrangements at fiscal year end expired in march  when the company entered into new interest rate swap arrangements with similar terms and a total notional amount of million 
the new interest rate swaps expire in june impact of inflation the company does not expect any significant short term impact of inflation on its financial condition 
technological advances should continue to reduce costs in the computer and communications industries 
further  the company presently is not bound by long term fixed price sales contracts which should reduce the company s exposure to inflationary effects 
the company s debt facilities financing is considered to be a material long term debt obligation  which may expose the company to inflationary effects associated with such variable rate loans  however  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge such exposure 
quarterly results of operations unaudited three months ended fiscal may aug nov feb sales     gross profit     income loss from operations     net income loss     net income loss per share diluted three months ended fiscal may aug nov feb sales     gross profit     income loss from operations     net income loss     net income per share diluted the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of brite during the second quarter of fiscal beginning june  the company s financial results include the operations of brite 
year compliance many installed computer systems used by numerous companies to run a variety of applications are not capable of processing date sensitive information that falls beyond the twentieth century 
the company was concerned that  unless these computer systems were replaced or upgraded prior to the year to process such date sensitive information  the systems might experience severe operating difficulties or system failures 
beginning in fiscal  the company initiated a program to replace and upgrade its information systems to accommodate the company s growth  improve productivity and remediate any century compliance problems 
this program was substantially completed during the third quarter of fiscal additionally  the company created a year project team to review and test its information technology systems and non information technology systems and to resolve any century compliance issues that were found 
the team also worked to ensure that any replacements and upgrades to the company s information systems were century compliant before they were implemented 
in this regard  the team also worked with third party vendors to assess the year readiness of its information technology systems 
the year readiness of the company s information technology systems is  therefore  partially dependent upon the accuracy of disclosures and representations made by third party vendors  such as oracle  peoplesoft  microsoft  ibm and dell computer 
because most of the expenditures to replace and upgrade the company s internal systems were incurred in the ordinary course of business ie  on a non accelerated basis  the company did not incur material incremental expenses in connection with its year remedial efforts 
as a result of the program to replace and upgrade its internal systems  and the efforts of the year project team  the company s mission critical internal systems were century compliant in all material respects prior to january accordingly  the company did not experience any system failures in connection with its mission critical internal systems 
while it is very unlikely that the company will experience any significant year issues with its mission critical internal systems after the date this annual report is filed  there is still a possibility that the company may  in the future  experience century noncompliance issues with such systems 
the company created a detailed year testing program for its mission critical systems 
during the first fiscal quarter of fiscal  the company completed a century compliance testing and remediation program for its customer service systems 
the company substantially completed its testing and remediation program for year issues with respect to mission critical systems during the third fiscal quarter 
prior to the merger  brite had conducted a testing and remediation program for year issues associated with its mission critical systems 
the company also reviewed and confirmed the year readiness of mission critical systems acquired in the merger that remained in operation after the end of calendar year many mission critical systems and or system applications associated with the domestic operations of brite  such as finance and purchasing  were transitioned to the company s existing enterprise system before the year the commencement of the company s fiscal year on march  helped to accelerate its year testing program  particularly for mission critical financial  manufacturing and order entry applications which process dates that reflect the fiscal year end date ie  february  
in addition to assessing and testing internal business systems for year readiness issues  the company also reviewed its other contingency plans for system failures that might have  but did not  arise in connection with the millennium transition 
the company used certain previously developed disaster recovery processes and procedures that would have allowed it to continue critical business operations in the event of a software or hardware failure  or the failure of infrastructure services ie  electricity  telephone services  water transport  internet services  etc these disaster recovery processes and procedures generally involved manual work arounds and alternate computerized solutions 
the company determined that these processes and procedures were adequate in light of potential century compliance issues 
as part of the contingency plan  the company acquired auxiliary power generators to help operate mission critical systems in the event of temporary power failures 
the company also implemented plans for addressing any year readiness issues or concerns of customers during the weeks surrounding the turn of the century 
these plans included additional staffing in the company s realcare maintenance department  specific procedures for diagnosing and resolving year readiness issues for customer systems  restrictions on vacations during the january st time frame  and additional phone capacity to handle any increase in customer service calls 
based on a thorough review and testing of its software products and other products  the company believes that its current products are century compliant 
the company began designating certain products as such in june brite began designating certain of its products as century compliant beginning in august the company s assessment of its current products  including brite s products  was partially dependent upon the accuracy of disclosures and representations concerning century compliance made by its suppliers  such as microsoft  ibm and dell computer 
however  the company was concerned that many customers were using earlier versions of software products and other products that the company had not designated as century compliant 
the company had instituted programs to actively warn these customers of the risks associated with using software and other products which may not be century compliant  and to actively encourage such customers to migrate to the company s current products 
the company did not experience a significant increase in customer service calls during the first two weeks of january any customer service inquiries which were  or might have been  related to the century date change  generally involved minor nonconformities which were resolved within hours or less 
while it is conceivable that the company may receive some additional customer service call relating to the century date change  the company does not anticipate receiving many such inquiries 
the company has not been required to defend its products or services in judicial proceedings related to the century date change 
as a result of the company s success in minimizing and resolving century noncompliance issues and notifying customers of the actions necessary to avoid such issues  the company believes it is unlikely that it will be required in the future to defend its products or services in proceedings against claims based on century noncompliance issues 
however  there is no assurance the company will not be involved in such proceedings in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
the company s current term loan and revolving credit agreement provides for borrowings up to million which bear interest at variable rates based on either a prime rate  the federal funds rate or the london interbank offering rate  plus an applicable margin 
as of february   the company had million and million outstanding  respectively  under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement matures on august  and the term loan facility is subject to quarterly principal amortization with the first payment due may  the fair value of the borrowings approximate their carrying value at february  due to the magnitude of this credit facility  the company believes that the effect of any reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows may be material
