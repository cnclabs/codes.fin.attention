the company is able to influence the frequency of loan redemption by increasing or decreasing the amount loaned in relation to the resale value of the pledged property 
tighter credit decisions generally result in smaller loans in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property and can thereby decrease the company s aggregate loan balance and  consequently  decrease pawn service charges
