item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year in review in  southwest posted a profit for the th consecutive year 
the company posted record operating revenues  record operating income  the highest operating profit margin since of percent  and a record load factor of percent 
the company also experienced a record annual profit for the eighth consecutive year 
we experienced strong revenue growth and continued strong demand for our product 
fuel prices in fourth quarter rose to their highest levels since at the end of  southwest served cities in states 
we targeted the east coast for our expansion  adding service to islip  new york  on long island in march  raleigh durham  north carolina  in june  and hartford  connecticut  in october and have been very pleased with the results in each of these new southwest cities 
the company recently announced plans to commence service to albany  new york  in may and will begin serving at least one other new city in in addition  we plan to continue to add flights between cities we already serve 
capacity is expected to grow approximately percent in with the net addition of at least aircraft 
the company will purchase new boeing s scheduled for delivery during the year and has agreed to a long term lease arrangement to acquire another in march of in addition  two of the company s older s are scheduled for retirement during the year 
results of operations compared with the company s consolidated net income for was million 
per share  diluted  as compared to the corresponding amount of million 
per share  diluted  an increase of percent 
the prior years earnings per share amounts have been restated for the three for two stock split see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating income increased percent for to million 
operating revenues consolidated operating revenues increased percent in primarily due to a percent increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues was primarily due to a percent increase in revenue passengers carried and a percent increase in revenue passenger miles rpms 
the passenger revenue yield per rpm decreased percent to 
for primarily due to an increase in average length of passenger haul of percent partially offset by a percent increase in average passenger fare 
the company expects the trend toward gradually increasing lengths of passenger haul to continue in the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  competitive responses from other air carriers and general economic conditions 
the percent increase in rpms in exceeded the percent increase in available seat miles asms  resulting in an increase in load factor from percent in to percent in the asm growth resulted from the net addition of aircraft during the year 
favorable load factor and revenue trends continued in january the load factor for january was percent  up 
points from january s load factor of percent 
freight revenues increased percent in compared to primarily due to added capacity and modest rate increases 
other revenues increased percent in compared to approximately percent of the increase was due to increased revenues from the sale of flight segment credits to marketing partners in the company s rapid rewards frequent flyer program  and approximately percent of the increase was due to an increase in charter revenue 
beginning january   the company will change its method of accounting for the sale of flight segment credits

operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for were  million  compared to  million in  an increase of percent  compared to the percent increase in capacity 
operating expenses per asm increased percent in primarily due to a percent increase in average jet fuel prices 
excluding fuel expense  operating expenses per asm for increased percent 
based on current trends  unit costs are expected to continue to reflect year over year unfavorable comparisons in first quarter as a result of higher jet fuel prices 
excluding jet fuel costs  the company is expecting nonfuel unit cost declines in first quarter compared to first quarter the immediately preceding two sentences are forward looking statements involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  the largely unpredictable levels of jet fuel prices and any unscheduled required aircraft airframe or engine repairs

total cent cent 
cent salaries  wages  and benefits per asm increased percent in this increase resulted primarily from increases in benefits costs  specifically workers compensation and health care expense 
employee profitsharing and savings plans expense per asm increased slightly due to higher earnings available for profitsharing 
fuel and oil expenses per asm increased percent in  primarily due to a percent increase from in the average jet fuel cost per gallon 
the average price paid for jet fuel in was  including the effects of hedging activities  compared to

as of february   the company had hedged its exposure to fuel price increases with combinations of purchased crude oil call options  crude oil collars  and or fixed price swap agreements approximating the following percentages of anticipated fuel requirements percent for first quarter  percent for second quarter  percent for third quarter  and percent for fourth quarter 
however  the company is expecting significantly higher jet fuel prices for first quarter compared to first quarter due to the historically low prices experienced in first quarter the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  the largely unpredictable levels of jet fuel prices 
in january  jet fuel prices averaged approximately 
per gallon  including gains from hedging activities 
the average cost of jet fuel in january was 
per gallon 
maintenance materials and repairs per asm increased percent in compared to routine heavy maintenance or airframe inspections and repairs represented approximately percent of the increase  while engine inspection and repair costs represented approximately percent of the increase 
the increase in airframe inspections and repairs was due primarily to a heavier volume of routine airframe checks scheduled for versus further  a portion of the company s scheduled airframe checks was outsourced in as the volume of work exceeded the available internal headcount and facilities necessary to perform such maintenance 
in  the company performed all of this type of routine heavy maintenance internally  thus  the majority of these costs was reflected in salaries and wages 
the increases in engine inspection and repair costs were primarily related to the company s aircraft 
the company s aircraft engine inspections and repairs are performed on a time and materials basis and are not covered by the company s power by the hour engine maintenance contract with general electric engine services  inc the aircraft experienced an increase both in the number of engine inspections and repairs and the average cost per repair 
currently  we expect no material change in unit cost for maintenance materials and repairs in versus the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  any unscheduled required aircraft airframe or engine repairs 
agency commissions per asm decreased percent in compared to  primarily due to a decrease in the percentage of commissionable sales to percent of total sales in compared to percent in based on recent trends  the company expects agency commissions to decrease on a per asm basis in the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  changes in passenger revenue levels and or consumer ticket purchasing habits 
aircraft rentals per asm decreased percent in compared to  primarily due to a lower percentage of the aircraft fleet being leased 
approximately percent of the company s aircraft fleet were under operating lease at december   compared to percent at december  depreciation expense per asm was flat for compared to although the company owned a higher percentage of its aircraft fleet in versus  unit cost was flat due to a change in the estimated useful lives of the company s boeing aircraft from years to years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this change in accounting estimate was made january   and resulted in a decrease to depreciation expense of approximately million for as the company s fleet ownership percentage continues to increase in compared to  the company anticipates an increase in depreciation expense per asm 
the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  a change in the company s aircraft financing strategy 
other operating expenses per asm increased percent in compared to this increase was primarily due to increased credit card processing costs resulting from a higher percentage of the company s ticket sales purchased with credit cards 
other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses 
interest expense decreased percent in primarily due to the february redemption of million of senior unsecured notes originally issued in february capitalized interest increased percent in as a result of higher progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries 
interest income for decreased percent primarily due to lower invested cash balances 
other losses in resulted primarily from a write down associated with the consolidation of certain software development projects 
other gains in primarily consisted of contractual penalties received from boeing due to delays in the delivery of aircraft 
income taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  increased slightly to percent in from percent in compared with the company s consolidated net income for was million

both of the earnings per share amounts have been restated for the three for two stock split see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating revenues consolidated operating revenues increased by percent in  compared to  primarily from an percent increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues was primarily a result of a percent increase in revenue passenger miles rpms offset by a percent decrease in passenger revenue yield per rpm 
while southwest s passenger revenues increased percent in  the rpm yield decline resulted from higher load factors  a percent increase in passenger trip lengths  and higher federal excise taxes on domestic tickets 
the percent increase in rpms in exceeded the percent increase in available seat miles asms  resulting in an increase in load factor from percent in to percent in the asm growth resulted from the net addition of aircraft during the year 
freight revenues increased percent in compared to  which fell short of the percent increase in asms for the same period 
united states mail revenue declined percent in and percent for fourth quarter as the postal service shifted business away from commercial carriers 
other air freight revenues increased percent in due to increased capacity 
other revenues increased percent in to million  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to increased revenues from the sale of flight segment credits to companies participating in the company s rapid rewards frequent flyer program 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for were  million  compared to  million in  an increase of percent  compared to the percent increase in capacity 
operating expenses per asm decreased percent in  compared to  primarily due to a percent decrease in average jet fuel cost per gallon 
the decrease in average jet fuel prices was offset by a million increase in employee profitsharing and savings plan contributions and an increase in maintenance costs primarily due to unusually low aircraft engine inspection and repair costs in the first half of salaries  wages  and benefits per asm increased percent in this increase resulted primarily from a percent increase in average salary and benefits cost per employee 
the increase in average salary and benefits cost per employee primarily is due to higher effective wage rates  lower productivity in caused by boeing aircraft delivery delays  and increased health care and workers compensation costs 
employee profitsharing and savings plans expense per asm increased percent in  primarily due to higher earnings available for profitsharing 
fuel and oil expenses per asm decreased percent in  primarily due to a percent decrease from in the average jet fuel cost per gallon 
the average price paid for jet fuel in was 
compared to 
in maintenance materials and repairs per asm increased percent in  compared to  primarily as a result of an unusually low number of aircraft engine inspections and repairs in the first six months of agency commissions per asm decreased percent in  when compared to  primarily due to a decrease in the percentage of commissionable sales 
aircraft rentals per asm decreased percent in  compared to  primarily due to a lower percentage of the aircraft fleet being leased 
depreciation expense per asm increased percent in  compared to  primarily due to a higher percentage of the aircraft fleet being owned 
other operating expenses per asm increased percent in  compared to  primarily due to increased costs resulting from the year remediation program and increased revenue related costs such as credit card processing and communications  partially offset by lower insurance costs 
other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses 
interest expense decreased million in primarily due to the february redemption of million of senior unsecured notes originally issued in february capitalized interest increased million in as a result of higher progress payment balances 
interest income for decreased primarily due to lower invested cash balances 
other gains in primarily included contractual penalties due from boeing as a result of aircraft delivery delays 
income taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  was unchanged from to liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  million in compared to million in also  during fourth quarter  additional funds of million were generated from two separate financing transactions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these borrowings 
cash generated in was primarily used to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and provide working capital 
during  net capital expenditures were  million  which primarily related to the purchase of new aircraft  four used aircraft  five used aircraft  and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries 
the five aircraft were previously on lease by the company prior to being purchased 
at december   capital commitments of the company primarily consisted of scheduled aircraft acquisitions and related flight equipment 
as of december   southwest had new s on firm order  including to be delivered in  with options to purchase another s during aggregate funding required for firm commitments approximated  million through the year  of which million related to see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on commitments 
on september   the company announced its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock 
repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time  depending on market conditions  and may be discontinued at any time 
as of december   million shares had been repurchased at a total cost of million 
the company has various options available to meet its capital and operating commitments  including cash on hand at december   of million  internally generated funds  and a revolving credit line with a group of banks of up to million none of which had been drawn at december  
in addition  the company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements 
the company currently has outstanding shelf registrations for the issuance of million of public debt securities  which it may utilize for aircraft financings in and market risk southwest has interest rate risk in that it holds floating rate debt instruments and has commodity price risk in that it must purchase jet fuel to operate its aircraft fleet 
to the extent the company does not have hedges in place  jet fuel will be purchased at prevailing market prices 
southwest also has market sensitive instruments in the form of the types of hedges it utilizes to decrease its exposure to jet fuel price increases in addition to its debt instruments 
the company also operates aircraft under operating and capital leases 
however  leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
airline operators are inherently dependent upon energy to operate and  therefore  are impacted by changes in jet fuel prices 
jet fuel consumed in and represented approximately and percent of southwest s operating expenses  respectively 
southwest endeavors to acquire jet fuel at the lowest prevailing prices possible 
prior to december  the company hedged its exposure to jet fuel market price risk primarily with purchased  out of the money  crude oil call options 
in december  in order to take advantage of historically low jet fuel prices  southwest increased its fuel hedging activity by entering into fixed price swap agreements hedging approximately percent and percent of its jet fuel needs in first and second quarter  respectively 
in january  the company increased its hedging position for second quarter to percent 
during the second half of  the company did not have a significant portion of its fuel purchases hedged as futures prices were substantially higher than then current prices 
since mid  energy markets and prices have changed radically 
as a result  the company has adjusted its hedge strategy 
the company utilizes financial derivative instruments for both short term and long term time frames when it appears the company can take advantage of market conditions 
at december   the company had a mixture of purchased crude oil call options and fixed price swap agreements in place to hedge approximately percent of its total anticipated jet fuel requirements 
the company had also entered into fixed price swap agreements to hedge a small percentage of its and anticipated requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in january and february  the company increased its hedging position by adding fixed price swap agreements and crude oil collars 
as of february   the company s total positions were approximately percent for first quarter  percent for second quarter  percent for third quarter  percent for fourth quarter  percent for first quarter  percent for second quarter  and percent for third quarter the company s fuel hedging strategy could result in the company not fully benefiting from certain fuel price declines 
the fair values of outstanding fixed price swap agreements and purchased crude oil call options related to the company s jet fuel market price risk at december  and  and during the year ended  were not material 
for  the company realized approximately million in gains from hedging activities 
a hypothetical ten percent increase or decrease in the underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december   prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments in place and their related cash flows by approximately million 
airline operators are also inherently capital intensive  as the vast majority of the company s assets are aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to capitalize itself conservatively and grow capacity steadily and profitably 
while southwest does use financial leverage  it has maintained a strong balance sheet and a or equivalent credit ratings on its senior unsecured fixed rate debt with three rating agencies standard poor s  moody s  and duff phelps 
the company s aircraft secured notes million do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are effectively floating rate debt 
the company s million in secured borrowings completed in does not give rise to significant fair value risk because these borrowings are also floating rate debt 
although there is interest rate risk associated with these secured borrowings  the risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company may prepay this debt on any of the semi annual principal and interest payment dates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these borrowings 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company had outstanding senior unsecured notes totaling million at december   and at december  these long term notes represent only percent and percent of total noncurrent assets at december  and  respectively 
the unsecured long term debt currently has an average maturity of nine years at fixed rates averaging percent at december   which is comparable to average rates prevailing over the last ten years 
the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on its unsecured long term debt because the interest rates are fixed and the financial leverage is modest 
additionally  the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash  which was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit and investment grade commercial paper that have maturities of three months or less 
as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at december   is low  as the investments mature within three months 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other interest rate market risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s debt instruments or its short term cash investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
because of the floating rate nature of the company s secured borrowings  a ten percent change in market interest rates as of december   would correspondingly change the company s earnings and cash flows by approximately million in however  a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow associated with the company s publicly traded fixed rate debt or its cash investments 
impact of the year the company has completed all significant aspects of its year project 
the company s year project encompassed information technology systems as well as embedded technology assets along with assessments of material third party relationships and associated risks 
all of the company s internal systems and software  including virtually all software and services provided by third parties  appropriately handled the year date changeover and the company s operations were also unaffected 
while the company has experienced no year related disruptions to date  there are remaining risks associated with the year issue and the company continues to monitor possible future implications of year issues 
based on currently available information  management believes that year related disruptions  if any  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations
