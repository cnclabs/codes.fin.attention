of this growth  million is primarily due to the addition of six affiliated dental practices in and the addition of affiliated dental practices in  representing current affiliated dental practice clinical locations

our negative working capital at december  of million represents a decrease from working capital of million at december  this decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to acquisition earn out and merger and restructure payables and accruals of approximately million excluding amounts paid during  payment of earn out consideration  and utilization of cash to pay down borrowings under our credit facility

additionally  advances to unconsolidated affiliated practices of million were performed 
advances consist primarily of receivables from pas due in connection with cash advances for working capital and operating purposes to certain unconsolidated pas 
the company typically advances funds to the pas during the initial years of operations  until the pa owner repays the seller debt  and the operations improve 
these uses of cash in investing activities were primarily funded through borrowing under our existing credit facility 
as a result  cash provided from the credit facility amounted to million for during  we acquired substantially all of the assets of affiliated dental practice clinical locations  including cash  accounts receivable  supplies and fixed assets 
the addition of these affiliated dental practices has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the aggregate dental practice acquisition purchase price recorded during the year ended december   representing the fair value of the assets acquired  including intangible assets  was million 
approximately million of the purchase price has been allocated to intangible assets 
the total purchase price included million in cash including 
million on deposit at december   million in common stock and warrants issued or to be issued under earn out agreements  and million in liabilities incurred and assumed 
in connection with certain completed affiliation transactions  the company has agreed to pay to the sellers possible future consideration in the form of cash and company capital stock 
the amount of future consideration payable by the company under earn outs is generally computed based upon financial performance of the affiliated dental practices during certain specified periods 
the company accrues for earn out payments with respect to prior practice acquisitions when such amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
during the year ended december   we paid million in additional earn out consideration 
as of december   the company had accrued million for future earn out payments  of which 
million is included in additional paid in capital for anticipated stock issuances while the remaining accrual for anticipated cash payments is included in other current liabilities 
for those acquisitions with earn out provisions  the company estimates the total maximum earn out that could be paid  including amounts already accrued  is between million and million from january to december  of which the majority is expected to be paid in cash 
in future years  such additional earn out consideration could result in additional amortization of million to million annually 
we have made loans to various unconsolidated affiliated dental practices in connection with their acquisition of assets of dental practices and have made working capital advances to certain unconsolidated affiliated dental practices for their operations 
advance and note amounts to be collected within the next year are classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
advances to pas bear interest at a rate of 
the notes receivable from pas generally have terms of to years and are interest bearing with rates between and 
both advance and note amounts are secured by the assets of the pas and are personally guaranteed by the pa owners 
we currently have a credit facility providing a maximum credit line of million 
the credit facility has a revolving feature expiring on september   at which time it will convert into a four year term loan to be repaid in equal quarterly installments 
principal amounts owed under the credit facility bear interest  at the company s option  at varying margins over libor or the prime rate  based on the level of interdent s leverage ratio 
our credit facility requires us to pay an unused commitment fee depending on amounts of unused available credit 
this fee is based on the average daily amount by which the bank commitment under the credit facility exceeds the aggregate amount of all loans then outstanding 
our credit facility contains several covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness  repurchase  or make dividends with respect to  our capital stock  and requirements relating to maintenance of a specified net worth and compliance with specified financial ratios 
in addition  the credit facility requires us to notify certain lenders prior to making any acquisitions and to obtain the consent of the lenders prior to making acquisitions with purchase prices exceeding a certain amount of cash and purchase price 
our obligations under the credit facility and our subsidiaries under the guarantees are secured by a security interest in certain equipment  fixtures  inventories  receivables  subsidiary stock  certain debt instruments  accounts and general intangibles of each of such entities 
we have outstanding million of subordinated convertible notes and million of convertible preferred stock 
the subordinated convertible notes have eight year terms and are convertible into shares of our common stock at for each share of common stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on such subordinated convertible notes 
if certain events of default occur  the subordinated convertible notes then outstanding will automatically convert into shares of our series b preferred stock at a rate of one share of series b preferred stock for each  in outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the subordinated convertible notes  subject to adjustment for stock splits  reverse splits  stock dividends  reorganizations and the like 
the subordinated convertible notes and all outstanding shares of our preferred stock shall be automatically converted into our common stock or  in the case of series a preferred stock and series c preferred stock  redeemed at nominal cost if the rolling day average closing market price of our common stock on out of any consecutive trading days is more than on or prior to may   or more than at any time thereafter 
we are authorized to issue  shares of preferred stock 
presently authorized series of our preferred stock include the following series series a shares authorized  issued and outstanding  series b  shares authorized  zero issued or outstanding  series c shares authorized  zero shares issued or outstanding  and series d  shares authorized   shares are issued and outstanding 
the shares of series b preferred stock are convertible into shares of our common stock at the rate of shares of common stock for each share of series b preferred stock assuming there are no declared but unpaid dividends on the series b preferred stock  and the shares of series d preferred stock are convertible into shares of our common stock on a share for share basis assuming there are no declared but unpaid dividends on the series d preferred stock  in each case subject to adjustment for stock splits  reverse splits  stock dividends  reorganizations and similar events 
the series a preferred stock and series c preferred stock are not convertible 
a total of  and  outstanding shares of interdent common stock issued at a price of and per share  respectively  are subject to repurchase as a result of a subsidiary s failure to achieve certain specified performance targets through december  it is anticipated that these shares will be repurchased in the future 
on october   we announced the signing of a merger agreement with leonard green and associates 
under the terms of the agreement  our stockholders other than certain members of our management at the date of the transaction will receive per share in cash 
completion of the transaction is subject to stockholder approval  receipt of regulatory approvals  and completion of debt financing required to fund the transaction  valued at million 
the agreement with leonard green and associates contemplates the purchase of all public stock to enable the company to be private 
in order to complete this transaction we need to raise capital which would enable the company to pay off its old credit facility and to buy the outstanding stock of the company 
we would also obtain an expanded credit facility to enable the company to be liquid enough to continue with its rapid expansion 
we are continually exploring alternatives to assure that the company has enough capital to continue its rapid growth 
we currently anticipate completing the transaction in the second calendar quarter of however  there can be no assurance that the financing will be obtained to complete the transaction 
we believe that proceeds from our existing credit facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations through the next fiscal year 
we also believe that such funds will be sufficient to complete a number of other future dental practice affiliations and any possible future consideration to be paid 
however  to execute our long term business strategy  we will require substantial additional funding through additional long term or short term borrowing arrangements or through the public or private issuance of additional debt or equity securities to affiliate new practices and to expand and maintain existing affiliated practices 
there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to interdent 
year compliance we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our financial or operating activities due to failure of our computerized systems  resulting from year issues 
furthermore  we have no information that indicates a significant vendor or service provider may be unable to sell goods or provide services to us or that any significant customer may be unable to purchase from us or provide timely payment of services rendered because of year issues 
also  we have not received any notifications from regulatory agencies indicating that significant regulatory action is being or may be taken against interdent  as a result of year issues 
accordingly  management does not expect year issues to have a material adverse effect on interdent s operations or financial results in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments which could expose us to significant market risk 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates as our credit facility has interest rates based upon market libor or prime rates  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in market rates  we lock fixed interest rates for periods of up to days on portions of the outstanding credit facility balance 
at december   we had million in floating rate debt under the credit facility 
the detrimental effect on our pre tax earnings of a hypothetical basis point increase in the interest rate under the credit facility would be approximately 
million 
this sensitivity analysis does not consider any actions we might take to mitigate our exposure to such a change in the credit facility rate 
the hypothetical change used in this analysis may be different from what actually occurs in the future 
our remaining subordinated notes and long term debt obligations of million are at fixed rates of interest
