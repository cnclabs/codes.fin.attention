on november   the company announced several important initiatives intended to build shareholder value 
these included a securities repurchase program and an initiative to develop a new retail concept that could serve as an expansion vehicle 
it is envisioned that the new retail concept could provide an opportunity to the company to have a more dominant position within some of the existing key categories in which the company now operates  as well as allow for entry into new  related businesses in which the company does not currently participate 
a five store test of the new concept is expected to commence in the second half of fiscal at an estimated cost between million and million  net of income taxes 
as announced in november  the board of directors has authorized the company to spend up to million to repurchase homebase common stock and convertible subordinated notes periodically in the open market  as market conditions warrant 
as of january   the company had repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of per share  and million in face value of convertible notes for million 
the repurchase program is authorized to extend through december  in light of the decision to pursue a new retail concept and the need to further refine the strategies for existing homebase stores  the company now estimates opening one to three new stores during fiscal the company believes that its current resources  cash flows from operations and amounts available under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to support its growth plans and related strategic initiatives and to finance operations through january  restructuring reserve as of january   million of the fiscal restructuring charge remained accrued on the company s consolidated balance sheet

risk factors if we cannot develop and test our new retail concept successfully  we may not have a new expansion vehicle  and our operating results could be harmed 
in november  we announced our intent to create a new retail concept that could serve as an expansion vehicle 
the new retail concept would have a completely independent identity from our homebase stores  with a different name  merchandising format and product mix 
we plan to start a five store test of the new concept in the second half of fiscal  costing between million and million after taxes 
if we cannot successfully develop and test the concept  the cost of the test may harm our operating results  and we may not have a new expansion vehicle to grow our operating results and counteract the other pressures on our business 
more competition could harm our operating results 
the home improvement  hardware and garden businesses are highly competitive 
we compete with a large number and variety of wholesalers and retailers  including two large national chains in the home improvement warehouse merchandising business which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
the home depot  inc and lowe s companies  inc 
are our major competitors that use the warehouse store format 
competition is most intense in the areas of price  product selection  location  service and name recognition 
competitive factors could require price reductions or cause an increase in operating costs  including increases in expenditures for marketing and customer service  that would harm our operating results 
some of the markets in which we now operate  or in which we might operate in the future  may already be at or near the saturation point in terms of home improvement stores 
some of our major competitors appear to have a strategy of clustering stores within  or saturating  markets in which they operate  or of placing their warehouse stores so close to our stores as to directly challenge our competitive position in such markets 
these strategies of our major competitors could harm our current operations and endanger our financial condition 
almost all of our stores have at least one home improvement warehouse retailer within their trading area  at an average distance of approximately three miles 
some of our major competitors have expansion plans in place 
we expect that our major competitors will open additional stores in our current market areas  which could harm our competitive position 
we will be harmed if comparable store sales decline or do not improve 
a significant measure of our performance is the change in annual same store sales  which calculates the change from year to year in the sales of our stores open for two full years 
while our same store sales improved somewhat last year  they have generally declined in recent years 
a variety of factors affect our same store sales  including the timing and concentration of new store openings actions of competitors  including the opening of additional stores in our markets the retail sales environment general economic conditions weather conditions our ability to execute our business strategies effectively 
if same store sales do not continue to improve  our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
if we have difficulty employing and retaining enough trained personnel to support our business  it could harm our operating results 
to support our business  we must hire and retain an adequate number of personnel  particularly store managers and sales associates  who possess the training and experience necessary to meet our customer service standards 
we may find it difficult to attract  develop and retain the personnel necessary to support our business 
if we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel  our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
our relatively short history as a separate company could harm our ability to access credit facilities and the capital market 
our business was operated as a division of a much larger company until july  so we do not have a significant operating history as a separate  stand alone company 
before july  the two divisions of waban inc  bj s and homebase  each had access to the cash flow generated by the other and to the combined credit of the enterprise  which was based on the combined assets and operating results of the bj s and homebase divisions 
if our financial performance as a separate  stand alone company is poor  it could harm our ability to access credit facilities and capital markets in the future 
to the extent we experience reduced access to capital or higher capital costs  we may have difficulty financing our business strategies  which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
reliance on the western us market could harm our operating results 
our home improvement stores are located in the western united states  with more than half of them in california 
we have been harmed in the past by economic downturns experienced in our geographic markets  and future economic downturns in the western us could again harm us 
the extent of our real estate holdings subjects us to substantial environmental risks and regulations 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  emission and disposal of hazardous materials 
we have engaged and may continue to engage in real estate development projects and we own parcels of real estate on which our stores are located 
if we do not comply with environmental laws  it could result in the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts of law  which could harm our operating results or financial condition 
we do not have environmental liability insurance to cover these events 
we do not know of any significant environmental hazard on properties we own or have owned  or operate or have operated 
however  if significant environmental hazards occur or are discovered  we could be subject to severe penalties  including the costs of remediation  which could harm our operating results or financial condition 
potential conflicts of interest  management overlap 
our interests and those of bji may conflict due to the ongoing relationships between the companies 
sources of conflict include our continuing liability for some of bji s contractual obligations  including bji leases  and the other arrangements between the parties regarding lease liabilities 
in addition  herbert j 
zarkin currently holds the executive offices of chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer with us and chairman of bji s board of directors  lorne r 
waxlax is a director of both homebase and bji  and edward j 
weisberger serves as an officer and director of both homebase and bji 
we have implemented procedures to limit the involvement of messrs 
zarkin  waxlax and weisberger in conflict situations  including requiring them to abstain from voting as directors of homebase on some matters 
continuing obligations of homebase for lease liabilities after the spin off 
under the terms of the spin off  bji assumed all liabilities to third party lessors for leases entered into by homebase before the spin off for use by the former bj s division 
while we will continue to be liable  by law  with respect to those lease liabilities  bji has agreed to indemnify us for those liabilities 
however  if bji is not able to make payments under the indemnity  we would be harmed 
we may be harmed if holders of our notes require us to repurchase some or all of the notes upon a change of control and we do not have sufficient funds to complete the repurchase 
on january   we had outstanding the principal amount of million of senior subordinated convertible notes 
in the event of a change of control of homebase  each holder of our notes has the right to require us to repurchase the notes held by the holder  in whole or in part  at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes put up for redemption  plus interest accrued through the repurchase date 
if a change of control were to occur  we might not have the financial resources or be able to arrange financing on acceptable terms to pay the repurchase price for all the notes as to which the repurchase option is exercised 
any repurchase in connection with a change of control could  depending on the circumstances and absent a waiver from the holders of our senior debt  be blocked due to the subordination provisions of the notes 
if we do not repurchase the notes when required  an event of default with respect to the notes and with respect to senior debt occur  whether or not the repurchase is permitted by the subordination provisions 
such an event of default  and its consequences  could harm our operating results and financial condition
