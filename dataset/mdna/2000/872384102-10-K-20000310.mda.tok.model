the financial condition and liquidity section analyzes cash flows and financial position 
discussion included in other matters addresses key trends  future plans and contingencies 
throughout these discussions  management addresses items that are reasonably likely to materially affect future liquidity or earnings 
through its ownership of the products olp and the crude oil olp  the partnership operates in two industry segments refined products and lpgs transportation  and crude oil and ngls transportation and marketing 
the partnership s reportable segments offer different products and services and are managed separately because each requires different business strategies 
the products olp segment is involved in the transportation  storage and terminaling of petroleum products and the fractionation of ngls 
revenues are derived from the transportation of refined products and lpgs  the storage and short haul shuttle transportation of lpgs at the mont belvieu  texas  complex  sale of product inventory and other ancillary services 
labor and electric power costs comprise the two largest operating expense items of the products olp 
operations are somewhat seasonal with higher revenues generally realized during the first and fourth quarters of each year 
refined products volumes are generally higher during the second and third quarters because of greater demand for gasolines during the spring and summer driving seasons 
lpgs volumes are generally higher from november through march due to higher demand in the northeast for propane  a major fuel for residential heating 
the crude oil olp segment is involved in the transportation  aggregation and marketing of crude oil  ngls  lube oils and specialty chemicals 
revenues are earned from the gathering  storage  transportation and marketing of crude oil  ngls  lube oils and specialty chemicals principally in oklahoma  texas and the rocky mountain region 
marketing operations consist primarily of purchasing crude oil along its gathering and pipeline systems and third party pipelines to facilitate the aggregation  transportation and ultimate sale of crude oil to local refineries or transportation to major oil hubs 
operations of this segment are included from november   the date of its acquisition from a duke energy subsidiary 
results of operations summarized below is financial data by business segment in thousands years ended december  operating revenues refined products and lpgs transportation    crude oil and ngls transportation and marketing   total operating revenues    operating income refined products and lpgs transportation    crude oil and ngls transportation and marketing   total operating income    income before extraordinary item refined products and lpgs transportation    crude oil and ngls transportation and marketing   total income before extraordinary item    for the year ended december   the partnership reported net income of million  compared with a net loss of million for year ended december  the net loss in included an extraordinary charge of million for early extinguishment of debt  net of million allocated to minority interest 
excluding the extraordinary loss  net income for the year would have been million for year ended december  the million increase in income before the loss on debt extinguishment resulted from a million increase in income provided by the crude oil and ngls transportation and marketing segment  which was acquired effective november   and a million increase in income provided by the refined products and lpgs transportation segment 
the increase in income provided by the refined products and lpgs transportation segment resulted primarily from a million increase in operating revenues  partially offset by a million increase in costs and expenses and a million decrease in other income net 
for the year ended december   the partnership reported a net loss of million  which included the extraordinary loss for early extinguishment of debt of million 
excluding the extraordinary loss  net income for the year would have been million  compared with net income of million for the million decrease in income before loss on debt extinguishment resulted from a million decrease in income provided by the refined products and lpgs transportation segment  partially offset by million in income provided by the crude oil and ngls transportation and marketing segment  which was acquired effective november  the decrease in income provided by the refined products and lpgs transportation segment resulted primarily from a million decrease in operating revenues and a million increase in costs and expenses  partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
see discussion below of factors affecting net income for the comparative periods by business segment 
refined products and lpgs transportation segment volume and average tariff information for  and is presented below percentage increase years ended december  decrease in thousands  except tariff information volumes delivered refined products    lpgs    mont belvieu operations    total    average tariff per barrel refined products lpgs mont belvieu operations average system tariff per barrel compared to operating revenues for the year ended increased to million from million for the year ended this million increase resulted from a million increase in refined products transportation revenues  a million increase in lpgs transportation revenues  a million increase in revenues generated from mont belvieu operations and a million increase in other operating revenues 
refined products transportation revenues increased million for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  as a result of a increase in total refined products volumes delivered and a increase in the refined products average tariff per barrel 
strong economic demand coupled with lower refinery production resulted in a million barrel increase in jet fuel volumes delivered and a million barrel increase in distillate volumes delivered 
jet fuel volumes delivered also benefited as a result of new military supply agreements that became effective in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by a million barrel decrease in motor fuel volumes delivered due to unfavorable midwest price differentials and reduced refinery production received into the ark la tex system and a million barrel decrease in natural gasoline volumes delivered attributable to lower feed stock and blending demand 
additionally  mtbe volumes delivered decreased million barrels as a result of the partnership canceling its tariffs to midwest destinations  effective july  this action was taken with the consent of mtbe shippers as a result of lower demand for mtbe transportation caused by changing blending economics  and resulted in increased pipeline capacity and tankage available for other products 
the increase in the refined products average tariff per barrel was primarily attributable to a higher percentage of long haul distillate volumes delivered in the midwest  partially offset by the general tariff reduction pursuant to the producer price index for finished goods less ppi index  effective july  the partnership has deferred recognition of approximately million of revenue with respect to potential refund obligations for rates charged in excess of the ppi index while its application for market based rates is under review by ferc 
see further discussion regarding market based rates included in other matters market and regulatory environment 
lpgs transportation revenues increased million for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  due to a increase in volumes delivered  partially offset by a decrease in the average lpgs tariff per barrel 
propane volumes delivered in the northeast increased from the prior year primarily due to colder winter weather during the first and fourth quarters of propane deliveries in the midwest market area and the upper texas gulf coast increased and  respectively  from the prior year primarily due to increased petrochemical feed stock demand 
the decrease in the average lpgs tariff per barrel resulted from the larger percentage of short haul barrels during  coupled with the reduction in tariffs rates pursuant to the ppi index  effective july  revenues generated from mont belvieu operations increased million for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  primarily due to higher storage revenue and increased petrochemical and refinery demand for shuttle deliveries of lpgs along the upper texas gulf coast 
other operating revenues increased million during the year ended december   compared with  primarily due to a million increase in gains on the sale of product inventory  a million increase in operating revenues from the fractionator facilities acquired on march   and lower exchange losses incurred to position product in the midwest market area 
costs and expenses increased million during the year ended december   compared with the prior year  due to a million increase in operating  general and administrative expenses  a million increase in operating fuel and power expense  a million increase in depreciation and amortization charges  and a million increase in taxes other than income 
the increase in operating  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a million increase in expenses associated with year activities  a million increase in rental fees from higher volume through the connection from colonial pipeline at beaumont  a million increase in labor related expenses attributable to merit increases and increased incentive compensation accruals  partially offset by lower post retirement benefit accruals  and increased outside services for pipeline maintenance

refined products transportation revenues increased million for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  as a result of the increase in volumes delivered and a increase in the refined products average tariff per barrel 
the increase in volumes delivered in was attributable to i favorable midwest price differentials for motor fuel  distillate  jet fuel and natural gasoline  and ii the full period impact of capacity expansions of the mainline system between el dorado  arkansas  and seymour  indiana  the ark la tex system between shreveport  louisiana  and el dorado  and the connection to the colonial pipeline at beaumont  texas 
the increase in the refined products average tariff per barrel reflects new tariff structures for volumes transported on the expanded portion of the ark la tex system and barrels originating from the pipeline connection with colonial s pipeline 
lpgs transportation revenues decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  due to a decrease in volumes delivered  partially offset by a increase in the lpgs average tariff per barrel

butane revenues decreased million  or  from the prior year due primarily to unfavorable blending economics in the midwest and termination of a throughput agreement during the second quarter of decreased petrochemical demand along the upper texas gulf coast resulted in a decrease in short haul propane deliveries 
the increase in the lpgs average tariff per barrel resulted from an increase in of the ratio of long haul to short haul propane deliveries 
revenues generated from mont belvieu operations decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  primarily due to lower storage revenue  lower product receipt charges and decreased propane dehydration fees 
additionally  mont belvieu shuttle deliveries decreased during the year ended  compared with the prior year  due to lower petrochemical and refinery demand for lpgs along the upper texas gulf coast 
the decrease in the mont belvieu shuttle deliveries was largely offset by a increase in the average tariff per barrel attributable to a lower percentage in of contract deliveries  which generally carry lower tariffs 
other operating revenues decreased million during the year ended december   compared with  primarily due to decreased product inventory volumes sold  unfavorable product location exchange differentials incurred to position system inventory  lower amounts of butane received in the midwest for summer storage and decreased terminaling revenues

interest expense decreased million during the year ended december   compared with  as a result of the repayment on january  of the remaining million principal balance of the first mortgage notes  partially offset by interest expense on the million principal amount of the senior notes issued on january   and interest expense on the million term loan used to finance the purchase of the fractionation assets on march  the weighted average interest rate of the million principal amount of the first mortgage notes was  compared with the weighted average interest rate of the million principal amount of the senior notes of 
the interest rate on the million term loan is 
interest capitalized decreased million from the prior year as a result of lower construction balances related to capital projects 
other income net increased during the year ended december   compared with the prior year  as a result of a million gain on the sale of non carrier assets in june and a million loss on the sale of non carrier assets in august these factors were partially offset by lower interest income earned on cash investments in crude oil and ngls transportation and marketing segment the crude oil and ngls transportation and marketing segment was added to the partnership s operations with the acquisition of the assets of a duke energy subsidiary effective november  the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase for accounting purposes 
accordingly  only operations from november  have been included in the partnership s financial statements

market and regulatory environment tariff rates of interstate oil pipeline companies are currently regulated by the ferc  primarily through an index methodology  whereby a pipeline company is allowed to change its rates based on the change from year to year in the producer price index for finished goods less ppi index 
in the alternative  interstate oil pipeline companies may elect to support rate filings by using a cost of service methodology  competitive market showings market based rates or agreements between shippers and the oil pipeline company that the rate is acceptable settlement rates 
during june  the partnership filed rate increases on selective refined products tariffs and lpgs tariffs  averaging 
these rate increases became effective july  without suspension or refund obligation 
on july   general rate decreases of for both refined products tariffs and lpgs tariffs became effective 
the rate decreases were calculated pursuant to the index methodology promulgated by the ferc 
in may  the products olp filed an application with the ferc to charge market based rates for substantially all refined products transportation tariffs 
such application is currently under review by the ferc 
the ferc approved a request of the products olp waiving the requirement to adjust refined products transportation tariffs pursuant to the ppi index while its market based rates application is under review 
under the ppi index  refined products transportation rates in effect on june  would have been reduced by approximately effective july  if any portion of the market based rates application is denied by the ferc  the products olp has agreed to refund  with interest  amounts collected after june   under the tariff rates in excess of the ppi index
