item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business rfm designs  develops  manufactures and markets a broad range of radio frequency components and modules 
the company s products are organized into two product groups  the communications products group and the low power products group 
the communications products group includes frequency control modules and filter products 
the low power products group includes low power componenets  as well as virtual wire r short range radio products 
the company s products are based on saw technology  and the company s strategy is to leverage its radio frequency design skills and its packaging technology to provide saw based solutions to the current and emerging needs of the electronics industry 
the company s products include more than resonators  filters  oscillators  transceivers  transmitters and receivers 
the company s average selling prices within these product lines generally range from 
to for low power products and to for communications products 
results of operations the following discussion relates to the financial statements of the company for the fiscal year ended august  current year or fiscal  in comparison to the fiscal year ended august  prior year or fiscal  as well as the fiscal year ended august  fiscal 
in addition  there is discussion of the financial statements for the three months ended august  fourth quarter  in comparison to the three months ended august  comparable quarter of the prior year  as well as the three months ended may  previous quarter 
the following table sets forth  for the years ended august i the percentage relationship of certain items from the company s statements of income to total sales and ii the percentage change in these items from year to year percentage of sales year to year change to to sales cost of sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative litigation total operating expenses income loss from operations  other income expense  net  income loss before income taxes  income tax benefit expense  net income loss  sales the following table sets forth the components of the company s sales and percentage relationship of the components to total sales for the periods indicated year ended august  amount of total amount of total amount of total dollars in thousands product sales low power product group low power components    virtual wire r radio products    subtotal    communications products group frequency control modules    filters    subtotal    total product sales    technology development sales total sales    product sales decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in number of units sold of low power component products 
product sales decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to reduced prices amidst competitive pressures in the company s largest product line  low power components 
low power components sales decreased in fiscal as a result of a decrease in the number of units shipped  primarily due to a change in the company s sales policy  largely occurring in the company s first quarter 
in the first quarter  the company decided not to offer special promotions programs to increase its turns business  because of the impact such programs had on long term gross margins 
this decision decreased sales in all product lines in the first quarter  but particularly low power components 
in addition  average selling prices for low power components products declined from the prior year  due to continuing competitive pressures 
during the year  however  the average selling prices for low power component products stabilized  at least in part due to the company s decision to discontinue special promotions programs 
sales for low power component products decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to declining prices from competitive markets 
this decline was partially offset by a increase in the number of units shipped 
the company believes that the markets for its low power component products are still very competitive and these markets have attracted a number of large international competitors  particularly for the automotive segment 
the increased competition has resulted in lower average selling prices in many cases 
the company believes that the impact of lower average selling prices may continue to be significant enough in future periods to offset the impact of selling an increased number of units 
thus sales for low power components may not increase  or even remain at the same level in future periods 
for several years  the company has devoted a considerable amount of its capital  technical  sales and marketing resources to the virtual wire r short range radio products 
sales for these products have decreased in fiscal year and increased in fiscal compared to fiscal in both years  sales were favorably impacted by an increase in the number of units sold for these products  as they achieved greater acceptance in the marketplace 
in current fiscal year  average selling prices for these products decreased as the products reached higher volume price points  resulting in a small overall decrease in sales 
during the year  the company made two significant decisions related to these products 
the first was a decision to stop selling the first generation version of these products  after allowing customers an opportunity to have a last time buy and to transition these customers to second generation or other company products 
the second generation products are designed to be more cost effective than first generation products 
the negative impact on gross margins of selling the first generation products should be largely complete by the second quarter of fiscal year the second decision impacting these products was the decision to focus new product development on communications products  rather than low power products 
the company believes that it has already developed a full family of virtual wire r products  so it can convert some of the engineering resources devoted to these products elsewhere 
the company intends to continue to work with its customers to develop new applications using virtual wire r short range radio products 
the timing of when any sales resulting from such new applications reach the production phase is dependent upon the timing of both the customers product development cycles and their product introduction cycles 
it is difficult to predict when  or if  these new products will have a significant impact on the company s sales 
filter sales increased in fiscal  while they decreased in fiscal the higher sales in fiscal results from an increased number of units sold 
the company has increased its engineering resources in this area and has developed a number of new products this year 
the increase in number of units sold reflects success in several of these programs 
the company will continue to invest in new product development in filter products  as it believes the rapidly growing wireless communications markets that they serve represent an excellent growth opportunity 
there is a long development and introduction cycle for filter products  so there can be no assurance as to when or if this strategy to focus on filter products will have a significant impact on the company s sales 
the decrease in fiscal over fiscal was due to a loss of sales to a major customer that ceased operation in fiscal frequency control module sales decreased in fiscal and sales decreased in fiscal the reduction in sales in fiscal was primarily due to a reduced number of units sold for several types of older products  particularly military oscillators and clock oscillators as programs involving these products experienced decreased demand 
the company expects that demand for these older products may not return to former levels  and in fact may continue to decline 
late in fiscal year  the company introduced a new line of optical timing products based upon its patented technology that target the optical dense wave division multiplex dwdm marketplace 
the company believes that products serving the optical network market represent a tremendous growth opportunity 
the first versions of this product were in dip style packages and began shipping in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the company plans to introduce surface mount versions of these products in the second half of fiscal year it is not certain when or if these new products will have a significant impact on the company s sales 
the company s top five customers accounted for approximately   and of the company s total sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
distribution related customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s total sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
one customer accounted for of total sales in  while no customer did so for fiscal years and the company s sales strategy is to seek diversification in its customer base  but due to the very competitive nature of the markets in which it competes  the company is not certain it will be able to continue to achieve this diversification 
international sales primarily in europe and asia were approximately  and of the company s total sales during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company considers all product sales with a delivery destination outside north america to be international sales 
these sales are denominated primarily in us currency 
the company intends to continue its focus on international sales in the future and anticipates that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its business 
however  international sales are subject to fluctuations as a result of local economic conditions and competition 
therefore  the company cannot predict whether it will continue to derive a significant portion of its business from international sales 
while the company has achieved sales increases in prior periods  there can be no assurance that this can be achieved in future periods 
the company s success is highly dependent on achieving technological advances in its product design and manufacturing capabilities  as well as its ability to sell its products in a competitive marketplace that can be influenced by outside factors such as economic and regulatory conditions 
competition from alternative technologies or from competitors duplicating the company s technologies may adversely affect selling prices and market share 
gross profit margin gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal the decline of gross margins is the result of three significant trends that occurred in both fiscal and fiscal first  the sales prices for the low power components and virtual wire r short range radio products declined due to competitive pressures in the market place 
average selling prices for low power components decreased from fiscal to fiscal  and from fiscal to fiscal average selling prices for virtual wire r short range radio products decreased from fiscal to fiscal  and from fiscal to fiscal this decline in average selling price was not matched by a decrease in per unit manufacturing costs  which in fact increased slightly as explained in the following paragraph 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company changed its sales strategy to no longer offer special promotions programs to increase its turns business 
this has had the effect of stabilizing prices for its low power products during fiscal and to greatly reduce the adverse impact that short lead time orders had on manufacturing costs for expediting materials  additional overtime  and other incremental costs 
it is believed that the long term benefits of this decision will allow for more stable prices and more predictable manufacturing costs and result in improved gross margins 
these products are still sold in a very competitive market  so it is not certain that a strategy to seek stable prices will allow the company to increase or even maintain its sales levels for its low power products 
if selling prices need to be reduced to maintain sales levels  it is not certain if the company can reduce per unit manufacturing costs in future periods to the same extent as the decrease in selling prices 
if that were to occur  gross margins would be adversely impacted in a material way 
second  a decline in sales volume in both fiscal years and resulted in higher fixed overhead costs as a percentage of sales 
the decrease in selling prices caused the need to produce more units to reach the same sales dollars 
the company has added equipment and other manufacturing overhead costs to increase the capacity in each of its facilities to handle both new products and an increased volume of its older products 
in the past year  added fixed overhead costs related to additional manufacturing equipment amounted to approximately million 
as a result  overhead costs as a percentage of sales increased by in fiscal if additional sales dollars are not obtained in future periods  overhead costs would remain at very high levels or even increase as a percentage of sales 
due to its offshore initiative  the company does not believe it will need significant additions to assembly facilities and equipment in the next year 
third  there were million in special charges to cost of sales in the first quarter  primarily related to the transition to new products  including continuing product introduction costs for the transceiver and costs related to the conversion to the second generation of virtual wire r short range radio products 
as stated above  a decision was made to stop selling the first generation version of these products  after allowing customers an opportunity to have a last time buy 
the second generation products are designed to be more cost effective than first generation products 
the negative impact on gross margins of selling the first generation products should be largely complete by the second quarter of fiscal year the company has embarked upon efforts to reduce manufacturing costs 
the first effort involves a focused program to improve production rates  yields and productivity within the existing facilities 
this has resulted in a significant reduction in per unit manufacturing costs in the second half of fiscal year  compared to the first half 
management intends to continue this focus on improved operations  although there can be no assurance these efforts will result in lower per unit costs 
the other major cost reduction effort is a program to outsource some assembly operations offshore 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company signed agreements with two different partners to manufacture its filter and to products 
production also began in this quarter 
the company believes a successful offshore manufacturing program could result in a material reduction in manufacturing costs 
the company plans to phase in the transition of products over several quarters  to insure uninterrupted product delivery to customers 
in addition  the transition will be supported with ample resources to address any contingencies that may arise 
as a result  the full benefit of the offshore program will not be seen at least until fiscal year given the complexities of the manufacturing processes involved  there can be no assurance that the offshore program will be successful 
the company has in the past experienced sudden increases in demand  which have put pressure on its manufacturing facilities to increase capacity to meet this demand 
in current quarter  for instance  the company experienced some difficulty in securing the additional labor resources necessary to meet rising demand 
in addition  new products sometimes require different manufacturing processes than the company currently possesses 
the company has devoted the bulk of its capital expenditures to increase capacity and improve its manufacturing processes 
the company may not be able to increase its manufacturing capacity and improve its manufacturing processes in a timely manner so as to take advantage of increased market demand 
failure to do this would result in a loss of potential sales in the periods impacted 
research and development research and development expenses decreased approximately million in fiscal and increased approximately  in fiscal expenses in fiscal were relatively high  due to costs of approximately  in the second quarter related to the introduction of a new packaging process and approximately  in the fourth quarter related to the costs of the transceiver product introduction 
these unusual expenses resulted in the increase in costs over since these unusual costs did not recur in fiscal  this also accounted for the bulk of the decrease compared to in addition  in fiscal year there was an increase of approximately  in engineering costs included in cost of sales related to the increase in technology development sales that occurred 
the company believes that the continued development of its technology and new products is essential to its success and is committed to continuing its investment in research and development  which is expected to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased approximately  or in fiscal and decreased in fiscal the increase in was due to an increase in sales commission expense related to the company s efforts to increase sales coverage by sales representative firms 
the decrease in was due primarily to decreases in sales incentives and marketing costs 
since sales and marketing expenses increased slightly more than sales  such expenses increased to of total sales in fiscal from of total sales in fiscal the company believes that while sales and marketing expenses initially increased as a percentage of sales  the changes it has made with its sales force will ultimately result in greater sales  although this increase is not assured 
the company expects to incur higher sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in future periods as it expands its sales and marketing efforts 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased approximately in fiscal and increased in fiscal the increase in was primarily attributable to employee severance costs  most of which occurred in the first quarter 
the increase in was primarily related to an increase in incentive costs related to restricted stock grants 
since sales decreased and general and administrative expenses increased  such expenses increased to of sales in fiscal from in fiscal the company currently expects general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods to support future operations  but that severance costs are not expected to recur 
litigation and unusual legal expense litigation and unusual legal expense  which amounted to  in fiscal  zero in fiscal and  in fiscal  primarily consists of expenses related to the resolution of several unrelated legal issues 
all of the legal matters involved have been resolved and the company does not expect to incur similar expenses in future periods 
other income expense during the current year  the company maintained indebtedness at a higher average balance compared to prior years  resulting in an increase in interest expense for fiscal  compared to fiscal as a result  other expense increased approximately  in the current year compared to the prior year 
the company expects that increased borrowings will result in increased interest expense in future periods 
income tax expense benefit the company s income tax benefit was approximately million in the current year  compared to an expense of  in fiscal and an expense of million in fiscal  reflecting changes in income or loss before income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the changes in the effective tax rate largely resulted from the availability of net operating loss credits in fiscal year and changes in benefits derived from the foreign sales corporation in fiscal year earnings per share the net loss was million in the current year as compared to a net income of  in the prior year and a net income of million in fiscal the company s diluted loss per share was per share for fiscal  compared to a net income of 
per share for fiscal and net income of 
per share for fiscal fourth quarter of fiscal unaudited quarterly financial data is presented in note of the accompanying financial statements 
sales for the fourth quarter of million increased approximately  compared to million in the comparable quarter of the prior year 
the sales increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of units sold in three of the company s four product lines 
sales also increased approximately compared to the previous third quarter 
gross profit margins were in the fourth quarter  compared to for the comparable quarter of the prior year 
this was primarily due to significant additional costs in the prior year related to ramping production late in the quarter and in bringing newly developed products to production status for the company s transceiver product line 
as a result  start up costs  lower than desired yields and some loss of productivity occurred in the prior year 
gross profit margins were slightly lower than the in the previous quarter  reflecting a large increase in sales of lower margin first generation virtual wire r short range radio products which were shipped as part of a last time buy program 
operating expenses for the fourth quarter were approximately million for the current quarter  compared to approximately million for the comparable quarter of the prior year 
current quarter expenses included a  decrease in research and engineering expense related to an unusual expense that occurred in the prior year that did not recur and an increase of  for litigation and unusual legal expenses 
current quarter operating expenses were higher than the previous quarter s million  primarily due to the litigation and unusual legal expense 
operating loss for the fourth quarter was approximately million compared to a loss of million in the comparable quarter of the prior year 
this decline in operating loss was due to the higher gross margins for the current quarter and lower operating expenses 
the operating loss for the current quarter was larger than the approximately million for the previous quarter  primarily due to the litigation and unusual legal expenses 
diluted loss per share was 
in the fourth quarter  compared to a loss of 
for the comparable quarter of the prior year and 
for the previous quarter 
without the unusual legal expenses in the quarter  the loss for the current quarter would have been 
per diluted share 
financial condition new financing arrangements in december  the company entered into an agreement with a commercial bank for a new credit facility consisting of a million revolving credit facility and a million term note 
included in the revolving credit facility is an million loan that is supported by the export import bank exim bank 
both facilities terminate on december  in addition  the company borrowed million under a temporary overadvance loan  collateralized by its fiscal year federal income tax refund that is to be repaid by january  the proceeds of these new loans and the sale of approximately million in short term investments were used to pay off approximately million for the revolving credit facility that was effective as of august   and million in obligations related to the equipment collateralized operating lease facility that was also in effect as of august  as a result  the company completely satisfied its obligations to its former bank and acquired approximately million in capital assets that had formerly been utilized under operating leases 
the structure of the new banking agreement ties amounts borrowed under the agreement to a borrowing base consisting of certain receivables  inventory  and fixed assets 
essentially all the assets of the company  tangible and intangible  are pledged as collateral under both facilities 
the term loan requires equal monthly payments of principal and interest totaling  beginning january the interest rate for both facilities is over prime rate 
as part of the agreement  the bank was given a ten year warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
this new credit facility contains financial covenants relating to various matters  including but not limited to  minimum net worth  quarterly and monthly earnings  and limitations on changes in corporate structure  and restrictions on dividends and capital spending 
although the company believes that it will be able to meet the covenants  there is no assurance that this will occur 
should there be a covenant violation without a waiver on favorable terms  there could be a significant adverse impact on the company s operations 
to move manufacturing equipment to support the offshore manufacturing initiative  it will be necessary to pay off the portion of the term note related to the equipment being moved 
there is no assurance that this can be accomplished on favorable terms 
should that not occur  there could be a slowdown in the company s plans to expand offshore production 
in december  the company entered into an agreement to raise approximately  in cash by the sale of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
the sale consisted of  units 
each unit was sold at a price of and consisted of one share of common stock and a three year warrant to purchase one share of common stock at 
the agreement called for certain restrictions on the sale or further acquisition of stock by the investors  as well as the right to require regristration in the future 
the proceeds of the sale of this stock will be used to support the operations of the company 
old financing arrangements the major source of liquidity at august   consisted of approximately  of cash 
the million in short term investments were pledged as collateral on a line of credit agreement with a commercial bank and not available for immediate use 
as of august   the company was in violation of certain covenants in regards to its line of credit 
the amount of the line was reduced to the amount outstanding as of august  approximately million and there was no remaining availability under an equipment collateralized operating lease facility 
the structure of the loan had previously been modified to tie amounts borrowed under the agreement to a borrowing base consisting of certain receivables  inventory  cash and marketable securities  all of which are pledged as collateral  and the interest rate was increased by one percentage point 
the current credit facility contains restrictions and financial covenants relating to various matters including net worth  interest coverage and levels of debt 
the expiration date of the old line of credit was december  cash flows net cash used in operating activities was million in the year to date period of fiscal as compared to net cash provided from operating activities of million for the year to date period of fiscal the decrease in cash available from operations is due to the million net loss in the current year to date period that was partially offset by a million reduction in accounts receivable and inventories 
the company s internal plan is to maintain a nearly breakeven cash flow from operations for fiscal year there can be no assurance that this will be achieved 
cash used in investing activities was  for the current year  as compared to million of cash used in investing activities for the prior year  primarily as a result of approximately million in capital expenditures offset by a net reduction of million in short term investments 
cash used in investing activities was million in the prior year  due to million in capital expenditures 
the company expects to acquire a total of approximately million to million of capital equipment by the end of fiscal  consisting primarily of equipment needed for its wafer fabrication manufacturing facilities 
due to its offshore manufacturing initiative  the company does not expect to require significant additions to its assembly facilities or equipment 
net cash generated from financing activities was million in and million in  respectively 
in the current year  approximately million was raised from a net increase in borrowings and million in sales of stock from stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
in the prior year  million was raised in a net increase in borrowings and  in sales of stock 
as of the date of this report  the company had approximately million available in cash and under the new credit arrangement  based upon the borrowing base at that time 
in addition  approximately million more may become available under the revolving credit facility  if the company s borrowing base were to increase sufficiently to support the increased borrowing 
there can be no assurance that this will happen 
the company believes that cash generated from operations  if any  its cash balances and the amounts available under its new credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s operating cash requirements through the fiscal year to the extent that these sources of funds are insufficient to meet the company s capital or operating requirements  the company may be required to raise additional funds 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
should that occur  there could be significant adverse impact on the company s operations 
year readiness disclosure the company completed its plan to address year yk computer issues and during the year rollover the company did not experience any significant problems related to computer hardware  software and imbedded chip malfunctions 
the company does not expect to experience yk issues in future periods
