item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a substantial portion of the company s non us transactions is denominated in french francs 
although sames  sa is not typically subject to significant foreign exchange transaction gains or losses  its financial statements are translated into us dollars as part of the company s consolidated financial reporting 
fluctuations in the french franc us dollar exchange rate therefore will affect the company s consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
at november   the french franc had depreciated by approximately compared to the prior year end while the average french franc us dollar exchange rate was approximately higher in the twelve months ended november  compared to the comparable period 
the company also has operations in japan and sweden  where transactions are denominated in japanese yen and swedish krona 
in the twelve months ended november   the net change in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment  which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  was an unrealized loss of million 
an unrealized foreign currency translation gain of 
million was recorded in the twelve months ended november  and an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of million was recorded in the twelve months ended november  foreign currency transactions and translation of financial statements foreign currency exchange transactions have not typically resulted in significant periodic gains or losses  although sames north america recorded a gain of approximately 
million during the twelve months ended november  the gain was recorded due to the combination of a relatively high intercompany payable to sames  sa  denominated in french francs  and the depreciation of the french franc  mentioned above  relative to the us dollar during the period 
the company generally does not use derivative financial instruments to manage currency exchange risks and no such instruments were outstanding at november  quarterly fluctuations the company has experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipates that those fluctuations will continue 
the fluctuations have been caused primarily by periodic changes in the components of the company s sale mix 
in particular  the company s sales of large automotive installations can fluctuate substantially and they generally result in relatively lower gross profit margins 
sales of standard products and spare parts typically generate relatively higher gross margins 
the company therefore believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance
