item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide greater details of the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information under item selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial data included elsewhere page herein 
certain statements under this caption constitute forward looking statements under the reform act which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to i the timely completion of the development and qualification for manufacturing of the company s new edram and fram products  ii broader customer acceptance of its edram and esdram products and low density fram products  iii acceptance of new high density fram products  which may be developed  iv the company s ability to manufacture its products on a cost effective and timely basis at its alliance foundry operations  v the company s ability to perform under existing alliance and joint development agreements and to develop new alliance and foundry relationships  vi the alliance partners willingness to continue development activities as they relate to their license agreements with the company  vii the availability and related cost of future financing  viii the retention of key personnel  ix the outcome of the company s patent interference litigation proceedings  and x factors not directly related to the company  such as competitive pressures on pricing  marketing conditions in general  competition  technological progression  product obsolescence and the changing needs of potential customers and the semiconductor industry in general 
for additional information concerning these and other factors  see expected future results of operations in this item since its inception  the company has been primarily engaged in the research and development of ferroelectric technology and the design  development and commercialization of fram products and edram products 
revenue has been derived from the sale of the company s fram and edram products beginning in the company has also generated revenue under license and development agreements entered into with a limited number of established semiconductor manufacturers and involving the development of specific applications of the company s technologies 
accordingly  fluctuations in the company s revenues have resulted primarily from the timing of significant product orders  the timing of the signing of license development agreements  and the achievement of related performance milestones 
for  and  fram product sales represented approximately  and of total product sales revenue  respectively  while edram product sales accounted for  and  respectively  for the same periods 
during these periods  product sales revenue accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total revenues  the remainder of which were generated principally from license and development fees  royalties and customer sponsored research and development revenue 
as a result of the company s limited revenues as compared to its substantial ongoing product research and development costs and high manufacturing costs for certain of its products  the company has incurred losses on a consolidated basis in each fiscal year since its inception and has required substantial capital infusions in the form of debt and equity financing 
page the company has entered into development and or licensing arrangements with several major semiconductor manufacturers  namely hitachi  rohm  toshiba  fujitsu  ibm and infineon to advance the development of both its fram products and edram products and to provide the company with access to advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes and capacity for such products 
in december  the company also entered into a license agreement with samsung  although such arrangement does not include any development activities between the company and samsung or the availability of manufacturing capacity to the company from samsung 
in addition to these licensing and or development arrangements  in december  the company entered into a fram development agreement with asahi which does not currently include a license to the company s fram technology 
in march  the company entered into a two year joint development agreement with fujitsu to pursue the development of advanced fram manufacturing processes 
this agreement provided the company with research and development funding and wafer fabrication processing equipment supplied by fujitsu 
results of operations revenues 
in  product sales revenues totaled million a decrease of approximately from product revenues consisted of million of fram products and million of edram products 
this is compared to product sales revenues during of million from the sale of million of fram products and million of edram products 
the decrease in product sales revenue in as compared with resulted primarily from a decrease in the volume of edram megabit products ordered and shipped to new and existing customers 
the company believes that the downward trend in megabit edram product revenues is a result of fluctuations in demand from a limited number of megabit edram customers 
although the trend in megabit edram revenues has been down during  the company still has substantial demand for the product and such demand is expected to continue for at least more years 
fram product revenues increased from the prior year primarily as a result of increased availability of fram products from one of the company s fram foundry manufacturing sources and from renewed sales and marketing activities resulting from the increased availability 
the company was able to maintain average selling prices on its products during despite price declines in competing products during the year 
product sales for consisted of kilobit  kilobit and rfid fram products and megabit and the recently introduced megabit edram products 
in  product sales revenues increased by approximately over product sales revenues in to a total of million  consisting of sales of million of fram products and million of edram products  compared to total product sales revenues during of million from the sale of million of fram products and million of edram products 
the increase in product sales revenue in as compared with resulted primarily from an increase in the volume of edram products shipped to new and existing customers  primarily in the communications sector 
the increase in fram product revenues during resulted from the first availability of fram products manufactured by one of the company s foundry partners 
page the company recognized million in license and development fee revenue during in  the company did not recognize any license and development fee revenue 
in  the company recognized license and development fee revenue of million 
license and development fee revenue is primarily attributable to the achievement of contractual milestones for existing licensees and development partners 
the company also licensed edram technology to nec during pursuant to the settlement of the company s patent infringement litigation with nec 
the company believes that its lack of license fee revenues during were driven primarily by the asian financial crisis and the overall semiconductor industry downturn experienced during the year 
further  the company and its alliance partners did not reach any contractual milestones during the year to allow for the recognition of any milestone licensing revenue pursuant to the terms of existing licensing agreements 
the company s license fee revenues during resulted from the achievement of milestones pursuant to an existing license arrangement with fujitsu and from the company entering into a new fram development agreement with asahi 
during  the company recognized royalty revenues of million compared with no such royalty revenue recorded in and the million nonrefundable payment was received under a fram licensing agreement with an existing licensee 
the payment was consideration for a direct licensing right to use ramtron intellectual property in the design  manufacture and sale of rf id products 
the company enters into customer sponsored research and development activities primarily as a means to further the development of its technology with certain strategic partners  customers or potential future technology licensees 
revenues from such activities were   and  in  and  respectively 
costs related to such activities were   and  in  and  respectively 
increases in customer sponsored research and development activities during are primarily the result of entering into an advanced fram manufacturing process development agreement with fujitsu in march cost of sales 
in  and  cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues were  and  respectively 
during the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues remained relatively flat as compared to the decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues in compared with resulted primarily from lower costs of manufacturing for the company s edram products and relatively stable average selling prices of the edram products 
the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for the company s fram products were approximately in  in and in cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for the company s fram products improved during resulting primarily from cost reductions achieved through manufacturing the company s fram products at an alliance foundry partner in japan 
additionally  the company was able to reduce its page costs of subcontract product assembly and testing on a per unit basis 
historically  the low manufacturing volume of fram products has resulted in higher costs associated with the company s external packaging and testing services and the cmos underlayer supply used in internal fram manufacturing 
improvements in the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for fram products are expected during  resulting primarily from the company receiving product from the advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes and facilities of the company s foundry alliances  assuming further successful completion of development and product qualification 
as the company s fram product sales increase the company will be better able to take advantage of volume manufacturing efficiencies 
the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for the company s edram products were approximately in  in  and in the increase in is primarily due to lower average selling prices on certain of the company s megabit edram products 
during the latter part of the company decided to sell low demand k x edram products at significantly discounted prices 
the discounted sale of the k x edram inventory helped a significant customer lower overall system costs in a price sensitive application 
substantially all of the k x edram product was sold during the company expects edram cost of product sales as a percentage product revenues to increase during as the company introduces new products with initially higher manufacturing costs 
as the volume of sales and production increase into on these products  the company expects to be able to achieve increasingly lower manufacturing costs and commensurate improvement in product gross margins 
provision for inventory write down 
during  the company increased its provision for excess and obsolete inventory by million 
the company determined it had excess inventories of a specialty fram product built for a selected market segment 
additionally  the company has determined that certain fram products which were manufactured in the colorado springs fabrication facility  prior to receiving product from our foundry partners  should be scrapped due to inferior performance attributes as compared to the same product manufactured by our foundry partners 
loss on manufacturing contract 
in august  the company entered into a contract with cubic corporation to manufacture  in the company s colorado springs manufacturing facility  a limited number of rfid memory chips using the company s fram memory technology 
as of december   the company determined that the total contract revenue compared with the estimated contract costs of manufacturing this product indicated that a loss in fulfilling the contract would be incurred 
the loss resulted from low product manufacturing yields  raw material quality issues and complications in product testing due to the complexity of the chip design 
accordingly  the company recorded a charge to earnings reflecting the total estimated loss to be incurred in the fulfillment of the contract in the amount of  the manufacturing of this product was completed in march the loss on manufacturing contract as a percentage of product revenues in was 
page research and development 
during research and development costs including customer sponsored research and development remained relatively flat as compared to totaling million as compared to million in in march  the company entered into a two year joint development agreement with fujitsu to pursue development of advanced fram manufacturing processes 
this agreement provided the company with research and development funding and wafer fabrication processing equipment supplied by fujitsu 
funding to ramtron in from this agreement totaled million 
in  research and development expenses including customer sponsored research and development increased to from million in the company incurred substantial increases in research and development expenses during for product development of its megabit esdram products and for additional future edram products 
edram product engineering expenses associated with the megabit esdram development increased significantly during to million from 
million in such increases in product engineering expenses included megabit esdram development costs for photomasks  engineering wafers and test probe cards totaling approximately million 
further  edram engineering design expenses increased by or roughly 
million to million during as compared to 
million during to support the megabit esdram development and future edram product development 
these increases in expenses for new edram product development were offset by decreases in fram research and development activities that utilized the company s colorado springs fabrication facility 
during the last five months of  the company s colorado springs fabrication facility was used almost entirely for the fulfillment of an rfid manufacturing contract entered into in august  rather than for fram technology development purposes 
certain of the resources that would typically be used in fram research and development activities were  therefore  used in fulfilling the rfid manufacturing contract and are included in cost of sales amounts and a recorded million loss on manufacturing contract recorded in the company anticipates that overall research and development costs will increase during and in future years as new fram and edram products and technologies are developed 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expense sg a increased million to million as compared to million in these increases are primarily attributable to legal and financial advisory fees incurred in connection with the company s preferred stock restructuring efforts and from increased in foreign withholding taxes related to license and development fee revenues recognized during in  sg a expenses increased by  to million from million in the primary increases in sg a expenses during when compared to were for commissions on increased product revenues and for financial advisory and legal costs incurred associated with legal and restructuring issues surrounding the company s convertible preferred stock 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in foreign withholding taxes during  as there were no licensing fee revenues recorded during the company recorded  in foreign withholding taxes from licensing activities during the company believes that sg a expenses for will remain relatively flat as compared to the company expects that increases in commissions as a result of increased product sales will be partially offset by reduced legal and financial advisory fees in page common stock price adjustment 
in december  the company issued and sold in a private placement to certain investment funds holders  shares of common stock at an issue price of per share 
the purchase agreement for such common stock provided that  if during the twelve month period following the closing of the transaction  the company sold any shares of common stock for an issue price lower than the purchase price  the purchase price per share of the common stock would be adjusted downward to equal the lower issue price 
any adjustment would be effected by issuing additional shares of common stock to the holders 
an issuance of common stock for an issue price lower than the purchase price occurred during september and october as a result of preferred stock conversions 
the lowest issue price from these conversions was per share  which then triggered a price adjustment pursuant to the terms of the common stock purchase agreement 
the holders are not required to accept  by way of this adjustment  a number of common shares such that the total number of common shares held by the holders would exceed of the total outstanding common stock of the company 
the company would be required to effect the adjustment by cash refund 
as of december   the additional shares and cash refund to effect the limitation adjustment was  shares and  respectively 
accordingly  the company s obligation to deliver cash to the holders was recorded as a charge to earnings during on july  the company s shareholders approved a restructuring plan that created a one year unsecured promissory notes for the cash refund amount of  at interest maturing july  in accordance with the provisions of the promissory notes  on february  the holders elected to convert the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest of approximately million into common stock of the company at a conversion rate of per share 
accordingly   common shares were issued to the holders 
interest expense 
related party interest expense in increased  totaling  primarily related to non cash amortization of a note payable discount recorded during for the valuation of stock warrants issued in connection with the amendment of the company s credit facility with the national electrical benefit fund 
in  related party interest expense increased by approximately or  over resulting from the expensing of interest on million of additional borrowings  which occurred during the last four months of under the company s credit facility with the national electrical benefit fund 
there were no additional borrowings under the credit facility during and other income expense 
in  the company recorded interest income of approximately 
million as compared to 
million in the company also recognized income of approximately 
million related to the reclaim of precious metal targets during in  the company recognized income associated with the collection of a 
million receivable written off in the previous year 
page imputed dividends accretion of discount on convertible preferred stock 
imputed dividend and accretion of discount results from certain provisions of the company s preferred stock  whereby a dividend is to be paid to the holders of the preferred stock in additional shares of preferred stock  and the conversion price of the preferred stock is determined by applying a discount  which increases over a fourteen month period from to a maximum of by may the discount computed at issuance of  is recorded as a reduction of preferred stock and an increase to additional paid in capital 
the discount is being recognized ratably as a non cash deemed dividend over the applicable fourteen month period 
in  the company recorded preferred stock non cash imputed dividends and accretion of discount totaling 
million as compared to million for the decrease in is primarily attributable to fewer preferred shares remaining outstanding during the year as a result of conversions of preferred stock during september and october  completion the amortization period in may and restructuring of the company s preferred stock in august during the year ended december   the company recorded preferred stock non cash imputed dividends and accretion of discount totaling 
million and 
million  respectively  as compared to 
million and million in  respectively 
preferred stock settlement 
on july   the company s common stockholders approved the restructuring of the terms of the company s preferred stock and on august   the company entered into an agreement with the holders of a majority of the outstanding preferred stock to restate the terms of the preferred stock 
in accordance with the restated terms of the preferred stock  holders thereof had until the close of business on august   to elect i to continue to own shares of preferred stock  ii to exchange shares of preferred stock  including accrued dividends  for cash in the amount per preferred stock share equal to of the liquidation value thereof  or iii to exchange the shares of preferred stock  including accrued dividends  for shares of the company s common stock at an exchange ratio of liquidation value of series a preferred per share of common stock 
effective as of august   of the  shares of preferred stock outstanding on august    shares plus accrued dividends were retired and canceled in exchange for the payment in the aggregate of  to the former holders thereof   shares of preferred stock were exchanged for  shares of common stock  and shares of preferred stock with restated terms remained outstanding 
the restated terms of the remaining preferred stock include i a fixed conversion at per share  ii a three year term expiring on july   iii an adjusted dividend rate of per annum subject to possible future adjustments  and iv a mandatory redemption feature at the date of maturity 
page for the year ended december   the company recorded a gain on the settlement of the preferred stock of million 
the million gain on the settlement of the preferred stock included a  gain recorded during april from an earlier preferred stock settlement 
the remaining balance of the million gain was determined on august  pursuant to the decisions of holders of the preferred stock regarding their restructuring options as described above 
the gain was determined on that date by comparing the fair value of the new instrument ie  cash  common stock and or restated preferred stock with the recorded value of the exchanged preferred stock including dividends  less restructure costs  with the difference being the recorded gain  which was recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
expected future results of operations the company is continuing its efforts to improve and increase commercial production and sales of its edram products and low density fram products  decrease the cost of producing such products and develop and commercialize new high density and low density fram products and enhancements to its existing fram and edram products 
the company expects revenues will continue to be sporadic in the foreseeable future until the company s products gain wider market acceptance  new license arrangements are entered into and milestones under the company s existing and any new license and development agreements are achieved 
the company s ability to significantly increase product sales and achieve profitability will depend on several factors  including i the completion of the development and qualification for manufacturing of the company s high density fram products  ii the completion of the development and qualification for manufacturing of the company s new edram products  iii wider customer acceptance of its edram products and low density fram products  iv market acceptance of new high and low density fram products which may be developed  v the company s ability to manufacture its products on a cost effective and timely basis through alliance foundry operations and third party foundry sources  vi the availability and related cost of future financing  and vii factors not directly related to the company  including market conditions  competition  technological progression  product obsolescence and the changing needs of potential customers and the semiconductor industry in general 
to gain access to advanced cmos manufacturing processes and facilities  ramtron has entered into manufacturing alliances and licensing agreements for fram products with companies having or constructing advanced memory products manufacturing capability  including rohm  hitachi  toshiba and fujitsu 
since the purchase or construction of an advanced manufacturing facility capable of mass producing memory devices would require a capital outlay well beyond the company s current capital resources  the company believes that the most suitable alternative is this strategic alliance approach  which the company believes will enable it to develop  manufacture and sell fram products more rapidly and cost effectively than any other available alternative 
ramtron s intention is to utilize current and future alliance relationships as foundry sources for fram products in order to provide the company with low cost  high volume  high quality fram products for resale to customers 
page the company intends to produce edram s through strategic alliances and foundry arrangements with major semiconductor companies and to expand the market for edram s by making edram products available from multiple sources 
this approach avoids the high capital costs associated with dram manufacturing that would have otherwise been incurred by the company if it had chosen to manufacture these products with company provided resources 
as a result of industry wide oversupply of semiconductor memory products  significant price decreases within the industry have occurred during the past several years 
historically  the semiconductor memory industry has experienced declining average selling prices  and the company believes these declines will continue to affect the company 
accordingly  the company s ability to increase revenues and margins on its products depends on the company s ability to increase unit sales volumes and to introduce new products with higher margins or further reduce its manufacturing costs to offset the declines in average selling prices 
absent these actions  declining average selling prices would have an adverse effect on the company s gross product margins and the overall financial performance of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase unit sales volumes  introduce new  higher margin products or reduce its manufacturing costs in the future 
year the company utilizes software and related technologies throughout its business and relies on suppliers of services and materials that will be affected by the date change in the year or prior 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit fields to designate a year 
as the century date change occurs  date sensitive systems will recognize the year as  or not at all 
this inability to recognize the year may cause systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
the company has initiated a year project to address the year issues as they relate to the company 
throughout the company maintained an active year program to update and replace software and hardware that it determined would be effected by the date change in the year and to monitor the remediation progress of all critical suppliers 
all remediation efforts were completed prior to december the company did not experience any material interruption of business as a result of year date changes 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  because revenues generated from operations and licensing have been insufficient to fund operations  the company has depended for funding principally on its stockholders  and in particular from until february on oren l 
benton benton  a former principal stockholder and director and the former chief executive officer of the company  and from through on the national electrical benefit fund the fund  a principal stockholder of the company 
benton and the fund financed the company s cash flow requirements through equity investments and loans  most of which were subsequently converted into equity 
page the company also raised funds through the private placement of convertible preferred stock in  all of which has been converted into common stock 
in  the company entered into a million loan facility  bearing interest at  between the company and the fund 
during  the company and the fund agreed to amend the terms of the credit facility extending the maturity date to march   decreasing the interest rate to and requiring the company maintain certain financial ratios  as defined in the loan document 
the company s borrowings under the fund s credit facility  including outstanding principal and accrued interest  totaled approximately million as of december  no additional borrowings are available to the company under the amended credit facility 
in december  the company sold approximately million of common stock  and in february  the company sold approximately million of series a convertible preferred stock  to certain institutional investors in separate private placements in order to obtain funds for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the company sold approximately million of common stock and common stock warrants in a private placement in december cash and cash equivalents decreased by million in to million 
the company generated million net of expenses from the sale of common stock during  which was offset by the use of million in the preferred stock restructuring and million to fund operating activities 
the company also used million in for investing activities  primarily for costs associated with the defense of the company s proprietary edram patent position 
receivables increased by million in from 
million at the end of to million at the end of the increase in the receivables balance is primarily due to increased customer product deliveries in december as compared to december inventories decreased by in from million at the end of to million at the end of inventory levels decreased as of the end of as the company decreased its production of megabit edram products to correlate with megabit edram sales volumes 
the company also increased its reserves for excess and obsolete inventories million during when it determined there were excess inventories of a specialty fram product built for a selected market segment 
additionally  the company determined that certain fram products which were manufactured in the colorado springs fabrication facility  prior to receiving product from our foundry partners  should be scrapped due to inferior performance attributes as compared to the same product manufactured by our foundry partners 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased slightly on a year over year basis from million at the end of to million at the end of this decrease resulted primarily from work in process decreases during the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in such decreases are the result of reduced manufacturing of megabit edram products to correlate with megabit edram sales volumes 
page during  the company invested million in intellectual property activities  due primarily to legal costs associated with the defense of the company s proprietary edram patent position 
expenditures for intellectual property purposes are expected to decrease during as a result of settling the nec patent infringement proceeding in november equipment and plant expenditures are expected to be minimal during during  the company received approximately million in cash relating to fram and edram licensing agreements for milestone achievements on existing licensing agreements and for a new license agreement 
payments pursuant to existing licensing agreements and new licensing agreements are expected to create additional cash flows during and  subject to the fulfillment of certain milestone conditions with existing license agreements 
an increase in product sales activity and customer sponsored research and development revenues is anticipated in additionally  the company expects to continue to receive cash inflows for research and development support provided by fujitsu throughout based on the company s capital resources as of december  and the expected operating costs and cash flows from product sales and licensing revenues  the company expects to be able to fund its operations through year end the company is currently involved in a patent interference proceeding see patent interference proceeding 
if the company is ultimately unsuccessful in these proceedings  there would be no retroactive cash payment requirements from the company to the junior party as a result of such an adverse decision 
while the company cannot accurately estimate the financial effects of such a result  the company believes that it could  depending on when a final non appealable judgment is ultimately rendered  materially adversely affect the company s fram product business and operating results and  thus  have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition as a whole 
in view of the company s expected future working capital requirements in connection with the design  manufacturing and sale of its fram and edram products  the company s projected continuing research and development expenditures  other operating expenditures and the results of pending patent litigation  the company may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing before or soon after year end there is no assurance  however  that the company will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
any issuance of common or preferred stock to obtain additional funding would result in further dilution of existing stockholders interests in ramtron 
the inability to obtain additional financing when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results and could adversely affect the company s ability to continue our business operations 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial positions  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating activities 
the company currently has no derivative financial instruments 
interest payable on the company s note payable to a related party is fixed  and  therefore  will not effect future earnings or cash flows 
the company manages interest rate risk by investing its excess cash in cash equivalents bearing variable interest rates  which are tied to various market indices 
the company does not believe that near term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
the net effect of a change in interest rates on outstanding cash and cash equivalents and debt at december  would have less than an  effect on the fair value of the debt and earnings or cash flows 
the company has a wholly owned subsidiary located in japan 
the operating costs of this subsidiary are denominated in japanese yen  thereby creating exposures to exchange rate changes 
to date  this subsidiary has had only limited operations and is expected to continue to have limited operations in the foreseeable future  and  therefore  the company does not believe any changes in exchange rates will have a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
the company also purchases certain of its fram products from foundry suppliers in japan with such costs denominated in japanese yen  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the japan us exchange rate may positively or negatively effect the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company  and therefore  the company has chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in japanese currency valuation 
average selling prices of the company s products have not increased significantly as a result of inflation during the past several years  primarily due to intense competition within the semiconductor industry 
the effect of inflation on the company s costs of production has been minimized through improvements in production efficiencies 
the company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures within the industry and markets in which the company participates
