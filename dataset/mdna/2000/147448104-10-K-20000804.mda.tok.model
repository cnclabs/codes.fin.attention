item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k 
casella waste systems  inc the company is a regional  integrated solid waste services company that provides collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services  generates steam and manufactures finished products utilizing recyclable materials primarily throughout the eastern portion of the united states and parts of canada 
the company also markets recyclable metals  aluminum  plastics  paper and corrugated cardboard all processed at its facilities and recyclables purchased from third parties 
the company also generates electricity under its contracts with its two majority owned subsidiaries  maine energy recovery company lp maine energy and penobscot energy recovery company lp perc  and through its wholly owned subsidiary  timber energy resource  inc teri 
as of july   the company owned and or operated five subtitle d landfills  two landfills permitted to accept construction and demolition materials  transfer stations  recycling processing facilities  solid and liquid waste collection divisions  power generation facilities  finished products processing facilities and its cellulose insulation joint venture 
the company s revenues have increased from million for the fiscal year ended april   to million for the fiscal year ended april  from may  through april   the company acquired solid waste collection  transfer and disposal operations  as well as kti  inc kti in december under the rules of purchase accounting the acquired companies revenues and results of operations have been included together with those of the company from the actual dates of the acquisitions and materially affect the period to period comparisons of the company s historical results of operations 
during the year ended april   the company acquired two waste collection  transfer and disposal operations in transactions accounted for as poolings of interests 
under the rules governing poolings of interests  the prior period and year to date financial statements of the company have been restated for all prior years to reflect the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the merged entities as if they had been one company for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
this form k and other reports  proxy statements  and other communications to stockholders  as well as oral statements by the company s officers or its agents  may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act  with respect to  among other things  the company s future revenues  operating income  or earnings per share 
without limiting the foregoing  any statements contained in this form k that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements  and the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of factors of which the company is aware that may cause the company s actual results to vary materially from those forecasted or projected in any such forward looking statement  certain of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include  without limitation  those outlined below in the section entitled certain factors that may affect future results 
the company s failure to successfully address any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
general the company s revenues are attributable primarily to fees charged to customers for solid and disposal waste collection  landfill  waste to energy  transfer and recycling services 
the company derives a substantial portion of its collection revenues from commercial  industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
the majority of the company s residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual households 
landfill  waste to energy facility and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at the company s disposal facilities and transfer stations 
the majority of the company s disposal and transfer customers are under one to ten year disposal contracts  with most having clauses for annual cost of living increases 
recycling revenues consist of revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities  operations and maintenance contracts of recycling facilities for municipal customers  recyclable brokering operations and from the sale of tire derived fuel 
the company  as a result of the kti acquisition  provides integrated waste handling services  including processing and recycling of wood  paper  metals  aluminum  plastics and glass  municipal solid waste processing and disposal  specialty waste disposal  ash residue recycling  brokerage of recycled materials and the manufacturing of finished products  primarily consisting of cellulose insulation manufacturing  using recyclable materials 
effective august   the company contributed its cellulose insulation assets to a joint venture with louisiana pacific  and accordingly  will recognize half of the joint venture s net income loss 
the company emphasizes the use of low cost processing to add value to the waste products delivered and  in some cases  the generation of electric power and steam 
the company operates these non core businesses under four reportable line of business segments waste to energy  residential recycling  commercial recycling and finished products 
these line of business segments are reflected in the company s revenues as follows waste to energy is reflected under disposal  residential recycling is reflected under recycling  commercial recycling is reflected under recycling and brokerage  and finished products is reflected under its own line 
the company s revenues are shown net of intercompany eliminations 
the company typically establishes its intercompany transfer pricing based upon prevailing market rates 
the table below shows  for the periods indicated  the percentage of the company s revenues attributable to services provided 
the increase in the company s collection revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal is primarily attributable to the impact of the company s acquisition of collection businesses during these periods  as well as to internal growth through price and business volume increases 
the decrease in the company s collection revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal is primarily attributable to the effects of the kti acquisition 
significant recycling  finished products and brokerage revenues were added through that acquisition 
the decrease in the company s landfill revenues and in the company s transfer revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal is mainly due to a proportionately greater increase in collection and other revenues occurring as the result of acquisitions in those areas  also  as the company acquires collection businesses from which it previously had derived transfer or disposal revenues  the acquired revenues are recorded by the company as collection revenues 
the increase in the company s landfill disposal facilities revenues and the company s transfer revenues as a percentage of revenue in fiscal is primarily attributable to the effects of the kti acquisition 
of revenues year ended april  collection landfill disposal facilities transfer recycling finished products brokerage other total revenues cost of operations includes labor  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  fuel  maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment  worker s compensation and vehicle insurance  the cost of purchasing materials to be recycled  third party transportation expense  district and state taxes  host community fees and royalties 
landfill operating expenses also include a provision for closure and post closure expenditures anticipated to be incurred in the future  and leachate treatment and disposal costs 
general and administrative expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead  professional services and costs associated with the company s marketing and sales force and community relations expense 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method  amortization of landfill airspace assets under the units of production method  and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets using the straight line method 
the amount of landfill amortization expense related to airspace consumption can vary materially from landfill to landfill depending upon the purchase price and landfill site and cell development costs 
the company depreciates all fixed and intangible assets  excluding non depreciable land  down to a zero net book value  and does not apply a salvage value to any of its fixed assets 
certain direct landfill development costs  such as engineering  permitting  legal  construction and other costs directly associated with expansion of existing landfills  are capitalized by the company 
additionally  the company also capitalizes certain third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions  such as legal and engineering 
the company will have material financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of its existing landfills and any disposal facilities which it may own or operate in the future 
the company has provided and will in the future provide accruals for future financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of its landfills generally for a term of years after final closure of a landfill based on engineering estimates of consumption of permitted landfill airspace over the useful life of any such landfill 
there can be no assurance that the company s financial obligations for closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds 
the company routinely evaluates all such capitalized costs  and expenses those costs related to projects not likely to be successful 
internal and indirect landfill development and acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationship that certain items from the company s consolidated financial statements bear in relation to revenues 
of revenues year ended april  revenues cost of operations general and administrative merger related costs depreciation and amortization loss on impairment of long lived assets operating income interest expense  net other income expenses  net provision for income taxes net income before discontinued operations and extraordinary item adjusted ebitda see discussion and computation of adjusted ebitda below 
fiscal year ended april  versus april  revenues revenues increased approximately million  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately million of the increase was attributable to the impact of businesses acquired throughout fiscal and fiscal  including kti  which was acquired in december in addition  the balance of the increase of approximately million was attributable to internal volume and price growth  including the positive impact of higher average recyclable commodity prices in fiscal compared to fiscal cost of operations cost of operations increased approximately million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal cost of operations as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenues was primarily the result of acquiring kti s recyclable brokerage operations  which carry high cost of operations as a percentage of revenues approximately 
brokerage comprised approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal  versus in fiscal additionally  the finished products line of business carries a lower operating margin than the company s core solid waste business operations 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily the result of acquiring kti s recyclable brokerage operations  which carry low general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues approximately 
the general and administrative cost savings from acquiring kti also contributed to the lower general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal merger related costs merger related costs consist of legal  engineering  accounting and other costs associated with the various poolings of interests consummated during fiscal and fiscal four such transactions occurred during fiscal and two occurred in fiscal  resulting in a decrease of million or 
merger related costs as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenues was the result of the company s acquisition of kti 
kti carried lower depreciation expense as a percentage of revenues approximately than the company approximately 
interest expense  net net interest expense increased approximately million  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal interest expense  net  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in from in fiscal the increase in net interest expense as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to two factors 
they are as follows i higher average debt balance in fiscal  versus fiscal and ii the company closed on a new million senior credit facility in december that raised the company s borrowing cost by approximately basis points over the company s previous senior credit facility 
other income expense including minority interest and equity in loss on unconsolidated subsidiary other income expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal other income expense  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the other income expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to the loss on sale of certain assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the equity loss on kti s investment in oakhurst 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal provision for income taxes  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase is primarily due to the company s increase in profitability in fiscal compared to fiscal an additional factor causing provision for income taxes  as a percentage of pre tax net income to vary was poolings of interest resulting in prior period restatements of entities not liable for federal income tax due to subchapter s status 
fiscal year ended april  versus april  revenues revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately million of the increase was attributable to the impact of businesses acquired throughout fiscal and fiscal in addition  approximately million of the increase was attributable to internal volume and price growth net of the negative impact of lower average recycled commodity prices in fiscal compared to fiscal cost of operations cost of operations increased approximately million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase corresponding primarily to the company s revenue growth described above 
cost of operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of i productivity improvements in the company s collection operations as a result of better route density from acquisitions  routing efficiencies through route audits and front end loader vehicle conversions completed throughout fiscal and  ii margin improvements because of price increases in fiscal and and iii higher landfill internalization due to the hyland landfill becoming operational in july general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues remained constant at from fiscal to fiscal due primarily to an increase in management information systems spending and public company expenditures for a full year in fiscal compared to a partial year in fiscal this increase was substantially offset by two acquisitions accounted for using the pooling of interest method 
these acquisitions had relatively low general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue 
merger related costs merger related costs consists of legal  engineering  accounting and other costs associated with the various poolings of interests consummated during fiscal and one such transaction occurred during fiscal and four occurred during fiscal  resulting in an increase of million or 
merger related costs as a percentage of revenue increased from in fiscal to in fiscal depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expense increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues was primarily the result of i higher rates of disposal internalization due to the opening of the hyland landfill  ii higher landfill volumes in fiscal compared to fiscal  resulting in higher landfill amortization expense  and iii front end loader conversions resulting in double container depreciation charges at certain locations 
loss on impairment of long lived assets the company recognized losses on impairment of long lived assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the amount of million 
the impairment charges were non cash charges to write down the assets of the company s waste tire processing facility in eliot  maine and the grasslands composting facility in malone  new york to their fair market values as of april  interest expense  net net interest expense decreased approximately million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease primarily reflects decreased average indebtedness in fiscal  resulting from debt payoffs following the public stock offerings in october and july  from the increased use of the company s class a common stock in effecting acquisitions  and from improved collections efforts 
days sales in accounts receivable was at april  compared to at april  the company capitalized a total of million in interest expense in fiscal  compared to a total of 
million in fiscal other income expense  net net other income expense was not material to the company s results of operations in fiscal and provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased approximately million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase reflects the company s increase in profitability in fiscal compared to fiscal the other primary factors causing income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax net income to vary were i the recording of a fixed asset impairment charge in fiscal which was non deductible for income tax purposes and ii poolings of interests resulting in prior period restatements of entities not liable for federal income tax due to subchapter s status 
liquidity and capital resources the company s business is capital intensive 
the company s capital requirements include acquisitions  fixed asset purchases and capital expenditures for landfill development  cell construction  and site and cell closure 
because of these needs the company has in the past had working capital deficits 
the company had positive net working capital of million at april  compared to million positive net working capital at april  the company has a million revolving line of credit with a group of banks for which bankboston  na is acting as agent 
this line of credit consists of a million senior secured revolving credit facility revolver and a million senior secured delayed draw term b loan term loan 
this line of credit is secured by all assets of the company  including the company s interest in the equity securities of its subsidiaries 
the revolver matures in december and the term loan matures in december funds available to the company under the line of credit were million at april  on june   the company entered into an agreement with berkshire partners pursuant to which it agreed to sell berkshire redeemable convertible preferred stock  which is convertible into the company s class a common stock at per share 
the company expects to raise approximately million in the transaction  which is expected to close in august the company believes that its cash provided internally from operations together with the company s available credit facilities and the preferred stock financing should enable it to meet its needs for working capital for the next twelve months 
net cash provided by operations for the fiscal years ended april  and april  was million and million  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in the company s net income for the fiscal year  net of non cash depreciation and amortization expense  which was partially offset by an increase in net working capital 
net cash provided by operations in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal primarily due to increases in net income  net of non cash depreciation and amortization expense 
for fiscal and fiscal  cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively 
the increase in investing activities reflects the company s capital expenditure and capital needs for acquisitions which have increased significantly  reflecting the company s rapid growth by acquisition and development of revenue producing assets 
the company s cash needs to fund investing activities are expected to increase further as the company continues to complete acquisitions 
for fiscal  cash used in investing activities was million 
for fiscal and fiscal  the company s financing activities provided cash of million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the fiscal year ended april  the net cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal years ended april  and primarily reflects the net proceeds of the company s secondary public stock offering and borrowings on the company s credit facility  offset by repayments 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal reflects primarily bank borrowings and seller subordinated notes  less principal payments on debt 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of the company s contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
the company therefore believes it should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require the company to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases  particularly during periods of high inflation 
the company s business is located in the eastern united states 
therefore  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region such as state regulations and severe weather conditions 
the company is unable to forecast or determine the timing and or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
year issues as of the date of this filing  the company has not incurred any significant business disruptions as a result of year issues 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
amends fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  by deferring the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the company will adopt sfas no 
beginning may  the company has yet to quantify the impacts of adopting sfas no 
on its financial statements and has not determined the timing or method of adoption 
however  sfas no 
could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda represents operating income earnings before interest and taxes  or ebit plus depreciation and amortization expense and loss on impairment of long lived assets 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  but is provided because the company understands that certain investors use this information when analyzing the financial position and performance of the company 
fiscal year ended april  restated operating income    depreciation and amortization    loss on impairment of long lived assets  adjusted ebitda    ebitda as a percentage of revenues see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
analysis of the factors contributing to the change in ebitda is included in the discussions above 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
we may experience difficulties integrating kti s operations and assets 
we acquired kti on december  since that time  we have experienced difficulties in integrating the operations of kti and these difficulties have caused us to revise our publicly disclosed projections 
there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience difficulties in integrating kti s operations effectively and that the acquisition will result in the synergies and other benefits anticipated by the two companies 
among other matters  in connection with the kti acquisition we assume certain obligations to finance and support a tire recycling joint venture 
we cannot assure you that the joint venture will achieve projected financial results or not divert management resources 
our increased leverage may impact our ability to make future acquisitions 
as a result of the acquisition of kti and the increase in our credit facility  our indebtedness has increased substantially 
this increased indebtedness has resulted in increased borrowing costs  which have adversely impacted our operating results 
in addition  the aggregate amount of indebtedness has limited and may continue to limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  and thereby may limit the company s ongoing acquisition program 
we may not be successful in making acquisitions  which could affect our future growth 
our strategy envisions that a substantial part of our future growth will come from making acquisitions consistent with our strategy 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and  once identified  to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us  or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with our operations 
certain of these acquisitions may be of significant size and may include assets that are outside our geographic territories or are ancillary to our core business strategy 
in addition  due to the increased consolidation of the solid waste industry and our current size  we cannot assure you that we will be able to make acquisitions in the future at a rate consistent with our historical growth rate 
we are dependent on the members of our senior management team 
we are highly dependent upon the services of the members of our senior management team  the loss of any of whom may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  train  motivate and retain highly trained personnel 
we may be in default under our credit facility if either john casella or james bohlig ceases to be employed by us 
our ability to make acquisitions is dependent on the availability of adequate cash and the attractiveness of our stock price 
we anticipate that any future business acquisitions will be financed through cash from operations  borrowings under our bank line of credit  the issuance of shares of our class a common stock and or seller financing 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient existing capital resources  that our stock price will be sufficiently attractive for use in an acquisition or that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital resources on terms satisfactory to us  if at all  in order to meet our capital requirements 
we also believe that a significant factor in our ability to close acquisitions will be the attractiveness of our class a common stock as consideration for potential acquisition candidates 
this attractiveness may  in large part  be dependent upon the relative market price and capital appreciation prospects of our class a common stock compared to the equity securities of our competitors 
the recent declines in the market price of our class a common stock could materially adversely affect our acquisition program 
environmental regulations could subject us to fines  penalties and limitations on our ability to expand we are subject to potential liability and restrictions under environmental laws 
our waste to energy and manufacturing facilities are subject to regulations limiting discharges of pollution into the air and water  and the solid waste operations are subject to a wide range of federal  state and  in some cases  local environmental and land use restrictions 
if we are not able to comply with the requirements that apply to a particular facility  we could be subject to fines and penalties  and we may be required to spend large amounts to bring an operation into compliance or to temporarily or permanently stop an operation that is not permitted under the law 
those costs or actions could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental and land use laws also can have an impact on whether our operations can expand and  in the case of our solid waste operations  may dictate those geographic areas from which we must  or  from which we may not  accept waste 
the waste management industry has been and likely will continue to be subject to regulation  as well as to attempts to regulate the industry through new legislation 
those regulations and laws also may limit the overall size and daily waste volume that may be accepted by a solid waste operation 
if we are not able to expand or otherwise operate one or more of our facilities profitably because of limits imposed under environmental laws  we may be required to increase our utilization of disposal facilities owned by third parties  and if so  our business  financial condition and results of operation could suffer a material adverse effect 
we have grown through acquisitions  and we have tried to evaluate and address environmental risks and liabilities presented by newly acquired businesses as we have identified them 
it is possible that some liabilities  including ones that may exist only because of the past operations of an acquired business  may prove to be more difficult or costly to address than we anticipate 
it is also possible that government officials responsible for enforcing environmental laws may believe an issue is more serious than we would expect  or that we will fail to identify or fully appreciate a historic liability before we become legally responsible to address it 
some of the legal sanctions to which we could become subject could cause us to lose a needed permit  or prevent us from or delay us in obtaining or renewing permits to operate our facilities 
the number  size and nature of those liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
our operating program depends on our ability to operate and expand the landfills we own and lease and to develop new landfill sites 
several of our landfills are subject to local laws purporting to regulate their expansion and other aspects of their operations 
there can be no assurance that the laws adopted by municipalities in which our landfills are located will not have a material adverse effect on our utilization of our landfills or that we will be successful in obtaining new landfill sites or expanding the permitted capacity of any of our current landfills once their remaining disposal capacity has been consumed 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials our results of operations may be materially adversely affected by changing purchase or resale prices or market requirements for recyclable materials 
our recycling business involves the purchase and sale of recyclable materials  some of which are priced on a commodity basis 
the resale and purchase prices of  and market demand for  recyclable materials  particularly wastepaper  plastic and ferrous and aluminum metals  can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control 
these changes have in the past contributed  and may continue to contribute  to significant variability in our period to period results of operations 
some of our subsidiaries involved in the recycling business use long term supply contracts with customers with floor price arrangements to minimize the commodity risk for recyclable materials  particularly wastepaper and aluminum metals 
under these contracts  our subsidiaries obtain a guaranteed minimum floor price for the recyclable materials along with a commitment to receive additional amounts if the current market price rises above the minimum price 
these contracts are generally with large domestic companies  which use the recyclable materials in their manufacturing processes 
any failure to continue to secure long term supply contracts with minimum price arrangements  or a breach by customers of one or more of these contracts could reduce our recycling revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the seasonality of our revenues could adversely impact our financial condition future seasonal fluctuations in our revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues have historically been lower during the months of november through march 
this seasonality reflects the lower volume of solid waste during the late fall  winter and early spring months resulting primarily from the volume of solid waste relating to construction and demolition activities decreasing substantially during the winter months in the northeastern united states  and decreased tourism in vermont  maine  new hampshire and eastern new york during the winter months  which tends to lower the volume of solid waste generated by commercial and restaurant customers  which is only partially offset by the winter ski industry 
since some of our operating and fixed costs remain constant throughout the fiscal year  our operating income is seasonally impacted 
in addition  particularly harsh weather conditions could result in increased operating costs for some of our operations 
our business is geographically concentrated and is therefore subject to regional economic downturns our operations and customers are principally located in the eastern united states 
therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to regional economic downturns and other regional factors  including state regulations and severe weather conditions 
in addition  as we expand in our existing markets  opportunities for growth within these regions will become more limited 
the costs and time involved in permitting and the scarcity of available landfills will make it difficult for us to expand vertically in these markets 
we cannot assure you that we will complete enough acquisitions in other markets to lessen our regional geographic concentration 
we may not be able to effectively compete in the highly competitive solid waste services industry the solid waste services industry is highly competitive  is undergoing a period of increasingly rapid consolidation  and requires substantial labor and capital resources 
some of the markets in which we compete or will likely compete are served by one or more of the large national or multinational solid waste companies  as well as numerous regional and local solid waste companies 
intense competition exists not only to provide services to customers  but also to acquire other businesses within each market 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than us 
from time to time  competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract 
these practices may either require us to reduce the pricing of our services or result in our loss of business 
as is generally the case in the industry  municipal contracts are subject to periodic competitive bidding 
there can be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder to obtain or retain these contracts 
if we are unable to compete with larger and better capitalized companies  or to replace municipal contracts lost through the competitive bidding process with comparable contracts or other revenue sources within a reasonable time period  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in our solid waste disposal markets  we also compete with operators of alternative disposal and recycling facilities and with counties  municipalities and solid waste districts that maintain their own waste collection  recycling and disposal operations 
these entities may have financial advantages because user fees or similar charges  tax revenues and tax exempt financing may be more available to them than to us 
our finished products divisions and our insulation manufacturing joint venture with louisiana pacific compete with other parties  some of which have substantially greater resources than we do  which they could use for product development  marketing or other purposes to our detriment 
one of our subsidiaries sells its entire output to a few customers and lacks the capacity to meet all of its commitments one of our subsidiaries operates three steam generating plants  one of which produces steam for a facility owned by e 
i 
du pont de nemours and company under a five year contract expiring on may  du pont has significantly reduced operations at this facility  and has the option to terminate the contract upon payment of a termination fee 
the second plant produces steam for an industrial park 
approximately of the steam produced by the plant is purchased by one customer under a contract that may not be terminated by the customer except for cause  and the balance is sold to ten customers under contracts which provide that our subsidiary may elect not to supply steam 
currently  maximum contracted capacity for all customers for steam exceeds the maximum rated capacity that may be produced by this plant 
actual demand  however  has not exceeded the maximum rated capacity 
if actual demand grows  the plant may need to install equipment to respond to peak demands  as well as equipment which may be necessary to allow the plant to meet stricter air quality standards  which may be adopted in the near future 
the cost of this air quality equipment  not including the equipment necessary to respond to peak demands  is expected to be approximately million 
we have closed the third steam generating plant  which sold all of its output to a customer which has filed for bankruptcy 
the termination of the contract with du pont or any of the significant customers who purchase steam from our subsidiary or its subsidiary could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected if we inadequately accrue for closure and post closure costs we have material financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of our existing landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any disposal facilities which we may own or operate in the future 
in addition to the landfills we currently operate  we own four unlined landfills which are not currently in operation 
we have provided and will in the future provide accruals for financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of our owned or operated landfills  generally for a term of years after final closure of a landfill 
we cannot assure you that our financial obligations for closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose 
such a circumstance could result in unanticipated charges and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could be precluded from entering into contracts or obtaining permits if we are unable to obtain third party financial assurance to secure our contractual obligations municipal solid waste collection and recycling contracts  obligations associated with landfill closure and the operation and closure of waste to energy facilities may require performance or surety bonds  letters of credit or other means of financial assurance to secure our contractual performance 
if we are unable to obtain the necessary financial assurance in sufficient amounts or at acceptable rates  we could be precluded from entering into additional municipal solid waste collection contracts or from obtaining or retaining landfill operating permits 
any future difficulty in obtaining insurance could also impair our ability to secure future contracts conditioned upon the contractor having adequate insurance coverage 
accordingly  our failure to obtain financial assurance bonds  letters of credit or other means of financial assurance or to maintain adequate insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to write off capitalized charges in the future  which could adversely affect our earnings any charge against earnings could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and the market price of our class a common stock 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to our acquisitions  pending acquisitions  landfills and development projects 
from time to time in future periods  we may be required to incur a charge against earnings in an amount equal to any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances  net of any portion thereof that we estimate will be recoverable  through sale or otherwise  relating to a any operation that is permanently shut down or has not generated or is not expected to generate sufficient cash flow  b any pending acquisition that is not consummated and c any landfill or development project that is not expected to be successfully completed 
we have incurred such charges in the past 
our class b common stock has ten votes per share and is held exclusively by john w 
casella and douglas r 
casella the holders of our class b common stock are entitled to ten votes per share and the holders of our class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share 
at july   an aggregate of  shares of our class b common stock  representing  votes  were outstanding  all of which were beneficially owned by john w
