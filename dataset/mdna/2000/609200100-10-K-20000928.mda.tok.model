item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction forward looking statements this discussion and other information provided from time to time by the company contain historical information as well as forward looking statements about the company  the premium wine industry and general business and economic conditions 
such forward looking statements include  for example  projections or predictions about the company s future growth  consumer demand for its wines  including new brands and brand extensions  margin trends  the premium wine grape market and the company s anticipated future investment in vineyards and other capital projects 
actual results may differ materially from the company s present expectations 
among other things  reduced consumer spending or a change in consumer preferences could reduce demand for the company s wines 
similarly  competition from numerous domestic and foreign vintners could affect the company s volume and revenue growth 
the price of grapes  the company s single largest product cost  is beyond the company s control and higher grape costs may put more pressure on the company s gross profit margin than is currently forecast 
interest rates and other business and economic conditions could change significantly the cost and risks of projected capital spending 
for these and other reasons  no forward looking statement by the company can nor should be taken as a guarantee of what will happen in the future
