liquidity and capital resources aegis realty  inc the company is a maryland corporation that has qualified as a real estate investment trust reit under the internal revenue code of as amended the code 
the company was formed to acquire  own  operate and renovate primarily supermarket anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers 
as of december   the company owned a portfolio of retail properties the retail properties containing a total of approximately million gross leaseable square feet gla  held partnership interests in two suburban garden apartment properties the multifamily properties  held one fha insured participating mortgage secured by a suburban garden apartment property the fha mortgage and had net assets of approximately  the company was formed on october  as the result of the consolidation the consolidation of four publicly registered  non listed limited partnerships  summit insured equity lp insured i  summit insured equity lp ii insured ii  summit preferred equity lp summit preferred and eagle insured  lp eagle the partnerships 
one of the general partners of the partnerships was an affiliate of related capital company related a nationwide  fully integrated real estate financial services firm 
as of december   there were  shares of common stock outstanding an additional  shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of op units 
the company has initiated a focused business strategic plan designed to increase funds from operations ffo and to enhance the value of its stock 
the plan concentrates principally on external growth and internal growth 
the company s external growth will be accomplished through continued acquisitions of retail properties either directly or in joint venture on an individual or bulk basis 
the company believes that there are significant opportunities available to acquire undervalued  undermanaged and or underutilized neighborhood and community shopping centers 
unlike most small capitalized reits  the company has the ability to benefit from its affiliation with a much larger company  related  with a national presence 
the company is using its affiliation with related to acquire properties on a national basis 
the company believes that by acquiring shopping centers on a national basis  rather than targeting a few markets or a region  it will be able to grow at a meaningful rate  without the need for it to compromise asset quality or current return 
in addition  a national acquisition program allows the company to maintain geographic diversity  which the company believes reduces the risk otherwise associated with focusing on one region 
the company seeks to acquire primarily  but not exclusively  supermarket anchored shopping centers  which are well located in primary and secondary markets 
acquisitions will be balanced between stabilized centers that the company believes are undervalued and centers that may be enhanced through intensive management  leasing  redevelopment or expansion efforts 
in all such cases  the company generally seeks to acquire only those centers that are expected to immediately increase ffo 
in addition  the company will consider strategic combinations in the form of portfolio acquisitions  joint ventures or mergers in order to maximize shareholder value 
on september   the company acquired an out parcel of developable land contiguous to the rolling hills square retail property for a purchase price of  not including acquisition fees and expenses of approximately  internal growth will occur from the re deployment of proceeds from the sale or other disposition of non core assets currently in the portfolio and through intensive management  leasing and redevelopment services provided to the company by the property manager and the advisor 
the company considers non core assets to be those assets the company has enhanced and no longer offer above market rates of return or those assets which due to location  configuration or tenant profile no longer offer the company the prospects of better than market rates of growth 
the company regularly reviews its portfolio to identify non core assets and to determine whether the time is appropriate to sell or otherwise dispose of such assets whose characteristics are no longer suited to the company s overall growth strategy or operating goals 
the company requires long term financing in order to invest in and hold its portfolio of retail properties and other investments 
to date  this long term liquidity has come from proceeds from the credit facility  notes payable assumed upon the purchase of certain properties and the issuance of shares of the company s common stock or op units in exchange for real estate 
although the credit facility may be increased  the company s charter dictates leverage of no more than of the company s total market value 
on a short term basis  the company requires funds to pay its operating expenses and those of the retail properties  to make improvements to the retail properties  pay its debt service and make distributions to its shareholders 
the primary source of the company s short term liquidity needs are the cash flow received from the retail properties and interest income 
on august   options to purchase  shares of common stock were granted to an officer of the company and certain employees of an affiliate of the advisor  who are not employees of the company 
vesting of the options is contingent upon the recipient continuing to provide services to the company to the vesting date 
the exercise price of these options is per share 
the term of each option is ten years 
the options will vest in equal installments on august   and on december   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  intended to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the credit facility 
this agreement effectively changes the company s interest rate on  of the credit facility debt to a fixed rate of and matures on december  the company accounts for the net cash settlements under this swap agreement as adjustments to the interest expense on the credit facility 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the interest rate swap agreement  however  the company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counter party 
as a reit  the company is required to distribute at least of its taxable income to maintain reit status 
funds generated from operations are expected to be sufficient to allow the company to meet this requirement 
the advisor believes that the stability of the company s operations and its ability to maintain liquidity are enhanced by i geographic diversity of its portfolio of real estate and its mortgage note 
ii of total revenues for the year ended december  were earned from shopping center anchor tenants which are national credit tenants and from interest on an fha mortgage 
iii no single asset accounts for more than of total revenues for the year ended december  iv leases that provide for recovery of actual common area maintenance charges and real estate taxes  thereby minimizing any effects from inflation 
v leases that provide for increases in rents based on a percentage of tenants sales 
vi a mortgage note which is substantially guaranteed by fha and a co insurer and that provides for participation in increases in operating results and market value of the underlying collateral 
during the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries decreased approximately  this decrease was primarily due to improvements to real estate  acquisitions of real estate including acquisition expenses  distributions paid to shareholders  an increase in deferred loan costs  and distributions paid to minority interest  which exceeded net cash provided by operating activities  and net proceeds from notes payable 
included in the adjustments to reconcile the net income to cash provided by operating activities is depreciation and amortization in the amount of  the company anticipates that cash generated from operations will provide for all major repairs  replacements and tenant improvements on its real estate and will provide sufficient liquidity to fund  in future years  the company s operating expenditures  debt service and distributions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the debt financing used to raise capital for the acquisition of the company s investments expose the company to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental policies  domestic and international political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
cash flows from the company s investments do not fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
in addition  as of december   approximately of the company s total notes payable outstanding are either fixed rate or non interest bearing  and so the payments on these instruments do not fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
in contrast  payments required under the credit facility vary based on market interest rates  primarily the day euro contract rate 
thus  an increase in market interest rates would result in increased payments under the credit facility  without a corresponding increase in cash flows from the company s investments in the same amounts 
for example  based on the  outstanding under the credit facility at december   and taking into account the interest rate swap agreement in place throughout as described  the company estimates that an increase of in the day euro contract rate would decrease the company s annual net income by approximately  a increase in the day euro contract rate would decrease annual net income by approximately  these estimates include the impact of the interest rate swap agreement discussed below 
for the same reasons  a decrease in market interest rates would generally benefit the company  as a result of decreased payments under the credit facility without corresponding decreases in cash flows from the company s investments 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow company management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s cash flows and earnings 
on december   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the credit facility floating rate debt 
management may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies
