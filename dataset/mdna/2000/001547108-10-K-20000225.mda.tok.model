item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is set forth in item ak steel s other operations consist of its sawhill tubular division  douglas dynamics  llc and greens port industrial park 
sawhill tubular  with three plants located in ohio and pennsylvania  manufactures a wide range of steel pipe and tubing products for the non residential construction  industrial  plumbing and heating markets 
douglas dynamics manufactures snowplows and ice control products for four wheel drive light trucks at plants in maine  tennessee and wisconsin 
its products are sold under the brand names western and fisher through independent distributors in the united states and canada 
greens port industrial park  which consists of approximately acres on the houston  texas ship channel  leases land  buildings and rail car storage facilities to third parties and operates a deep water loading dock on the channel 
customers ak steel s flat rolled carbon steel products are sold primarily to automotive manufacturers and to customers in the appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction markets  consisting principally of manufacturers of home appliances  heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment and lighting products 
hot rolled  cold rolled and semi finished steel products are also sold to distributors  service centers and convertors who may further process these products or resell them without further processing 
ak steel sells its stainless steel products primarily to customers in the automotive industry  as well as to manufacturers of food handling  chemical processing  pollution control and medical and health equipment 
electrical steels  which are iron silicon alloys with unique magnetic properties  are sold primarily to manufacturers of power transmission and distribution transformers  electrical motors and generators  and lighting ballasts 
in conducting its steel operations  ak steel s marketing efforts are principally directed toward those customers  such as automotive manufacturers  who require precise on time delivery  technical support and the highest quality flat rolled steel 
management believes that ak steel s enhanced product quality and delivery capabilities  and its emphasis on customer technical support and product planning  are critical factors in its ability to serve this segment of the market 
the following table sets forth the percentage of the steel operations net sales attributable to various markets years ended december  automotive appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction distributors  service centers and convertors ak steel s shipments to the automotive market have increased steadily in recent years  consistent with management s strategy of concentrating on the high end markets for flat rolled steel 
a major factor contributing to this increase has been the growth in the number of us based plants of foreign automotive manufacturers 
ak steel s steel operations segment supplies products to all of these producers and is a major supplier to general motors  ford motor company and daimlerchrysler ag 
shipments to general motors  ak steel s largest customer  accounted for approximately  and of steel operations net sales in  and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of net sales for any of these years 
ak steel is party to agreements with all of its major automotive and most appliance industry customers with terms that range from one to three years 
these agreements  which are typically finalized late in the year  set forth prices to be paid for each product category during each year of their term  and  except for nickel and chrome  where surcharges may be passed on to the customer  do not permit adjustment to reflect changes in prevailing market conditions or raw material costs 
during  approximately of ak steel s sales of flat rolled steel products were made pursuant to these agreements  with the balance being made at market prices at the time of sale 
raw materials the principal raw materials required for ak steel s manufacturing operations are carbon and stainless steel scrap  iron ore  coal  electricity  natural gas  oxygen  chrome  nickel  silicon  molybdenum  zinc  limestone and other commodity materials 
in addition  ak steel purchases carbon steel slabs from other steel producers to supplement the production from its own steelmaking facilities 
purchases of coal  iron ore and limestone  as well as transportation services  are made at negotiated prices under multi year agreements 
purchases of carbon steel slabs  stainless steel scrap and other raw materials are made at prevailing market prices  which are subject to fluctuation in accordance with supply and demand 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information with respect to the anticipated impact of rising raw materials prices on operations 
ak steel believes that adequate sources of supply exist for all of its raw material requirements 
employees as of december   the company had approximately  employees 
approximately  employees at nine of ak steel s fourteen plants are represented by international  national or independent unions  under contracts with expiration dates extending through labor contracts covering employees at the following plant locations expire in of total contract location union employees expiration date ashland works united steelworkers of america september  zanesville works zanesville armco independent organization  inc may  sawhill tubular united steelworkers of america wheatland  pennsylvania january  united steelworkers of america warren  ohio september  on february   represented employees at sawhill tubular s wheatland plant ratified a new year collective bargaining agreement 
ak steel s mansfield works was one of the facilities owned and operated by armco prior to its merger with ak steel on september  on september   the contract between armco and the united steelworkers of america covering approximately hourly workers  including on layoff status  at the mansfield works expired 
because of production slowdowns  vandalism and threats of violence on the part of union members  armco informed the union  and the company understood  that it would lock out represented employees while it continued to bargain with the union 
since early september  the mansfield works has been operated by salaried employees and temporary replacement workers 
on november   ak steel announced that it would permanently close the dover works and its redundant galvanizing line effective january  the plant employs approximately workers 
production at the plant ceased on december  competition ak steel competes with domestic and foreign flat rolled carbon  stainless and electrical steel producers and producers of plastics  aluminum and other materials that can be used in lieu of flat rolled steels in manufactured products 
price  service  quality and delivery are the primary competitive factors and vary in relative importance according to the category of product and customer requirements 
domestic steel producers face significant competition from foreign producers who typically have lower labor costs 
in addition  many foreign steel producers are owned  controlled or subsidized by their governments and their decisions with respect to production and sales may be influenced more by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions 
on june   armco and other domestic producers of flat rolled stainless sheet and strip products filed petitions with the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission itc charging eight foreign countries with violations of us trade laws 
on may   the department of commerce doc announced antidumping and countervailing duties on imports of certain stainless steel products of up to and on july   the itc voted affirmatively that foreign stainless steel imports have injured the domestic industry 
these rulings triggered the imposition of tariffs  which should result in higher prices for foreign flat rolled stainless steel and lower imports 
in mid  the doc and the itc began to review existing antidumping and countervailing duties involving italian and japanese producers of electrical steel  to determine whether these protections should be extended for another five years 
their deliberations are expected to extend into  during which time the current protections will remain in place 
the failure to obtain or extend meaningful tariff protections for products similar to those produced and sold by ak steel could adversely affect prices and reduce profit margins for those products 
environmental matters domestic steel producers  including ak steel  are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
over the past three years  ak steel has expended the following for environmental related capital investments and environmental compliance costs years ended december  in millions environmental related capital investments environmental compliance costs management does not anticipate any material impact on ak steel s recurring operating costs or future profitability as a result of its compliance with current environmental regulations 
moreover  because all domestic steel producers operate under the same set of federal environmental regulations  management believes that ak steel is not competitively disadvantaged by its need to comply with these regulations 
environmental remediation ak steel and its predecessors have been conducting steel manufacturing and related operations for approximately years 
although their operating practices are believed to have been consistent with prevailing industry standards during this time  hazardous materials may have been released at one or more operating sites  including sites that are no longer owned by ak steel 
potential remediation expenditures have been estimated for those sites where future remediation efforts are probable based on identified conditions  regulatory requirements or contractual obligations arising from the sale of a business 
pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which governs the treatment  handling and disposal of hazardous waste  the united states environmental protection agency epa and authorized state environmental agencies may conduct inspections of rcra regulated facilities to identify areas where there have been releases of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents into the environment and order the facilities to take corrective action to remediate such releases 
the company s major steelmaking facilities are subject to rcra inspections by environmental regulators 
while the company cannot predict the future actions of these regulators  the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities 
under authority conferred by the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  the epa and state environmental authorities have conducted site investigations at certain of ak steel s facilities  portions of which previously had been used for disposal of materials that are currently subject to regulation 
while the results of these investigations are still pending  in the future ak steel could be directed to expend funds for remedial activities at the former disposal areas 
given the uncertain status of these investigations  however  management is unable to predict if and when such expenditures might be required or their magnitude 
environmental proceedings under the authority of cercla  the kentucky department of environmental protection conducted a comprehensive review of the waste management control systems and handling practices at the ashland works coke department and steelmaking facility in july  august and september as a result of this inspection  the kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet instituted an administrative proceeding against the company in november  alleging certain regulatory violations 
ak steel has entered into non binding mediation with the kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet 
in  the ohio environmental protection agency oepa notified ak steel that it had referred to the ohio attorney general for potential enforcement action certain alleged violations of ohio s water discharge and hazardous waste regulations at the middletown works 
although management believes that ak steel has a strong basis for contesting the alleged violations  it is in the process of negotiating a consent order with the ohio attorney general that will address the state s concerns 
federal regulations promulgated pursuant to the clean water act impose categorical pretreatment limits on the concentrations of various constituents in coke plant wastewater prior to discharge into publicly owned treatment works potw 
due to concentrations of ammonia and phenol in excess of these limits in wastewater from the middletown works  ak steel  through the middletown potw  petitioned the epa for removal credits  a type of compliance exemption  based on the middletown potw s satisfactory treatment of the wastewater for ammonia and phenol 
the epa declined to review the petition on the grounds that it had not yet promulgated new sludge management rules 
ak steel thereupon sought and obtained from the united states district court for the southern district of ohio an injunction prohibiting the epa from instituting enforcement action against ak steel for noncompliance with the pretreatment limitations  pending the epa s promulgation of the applicable sludge management regulations 
management is unable to predict the outcome of this matter 
however  if the epa eventually refuses to grant petition for removal credits  ak steel could incur additional costs to construct pretreatment facilities at the middletown works 
on february   the oepa issued a notice of violation nov with respect to the zanesville works alleging noncompliance with both a order and various state regulations regarding hazardous waste management 
ak steel is continuing to work with the oepa and the ohio attorney general s office to achieve final resolution of this matter 
no proposed penalties were included in the nov and management is unable to estimate potential penalties  if any  based on current information 
subsequent to a multi media inspection of middletown works during the fall of  usepa region v notified ak steel that legal proceedings had been initiated alleging violations of clean air act and clean water act regulations 
the company is in discussions with region v and the department of justice concerning these matters 
on september   armco received an order from the epa under section of rcra requiring armco to develop a plan for investigation of eight areas of the mansfield works that allegedly could be sources of contamination 
on october   armco filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio seeking pre enforcement review 
on april   the court dismissed the complaint on the basis that the statute did not allow pre enforcement review of agency orders 
thereafter  armco filed a motion for reconsideration  which is still pending 
in july  armco submitted to the usepa a work plan for investigation that is currently under review 
in december  the usepa region v requested additional information to be supplied in support of the modified investigation plan submitted by armco in july in addition to the foregoing matters  the company is or may be involved in proceedings with various regulatory authorities that may require the company to pay fines  comply with more rigorous standards or other requirements or incur capital and operating expenses for environmental compliance 
management believes that the ultimate disposition of the foregoing proceedings will not have  individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

operating results in were negatively impacted to by a work stoppage at general motors ak steel s largest customer and a planned twenty day blast furnace outage at the middletown works 
in addition  the company realized lower selling prices  particularly for its carbon hot rolled  stainless sheet and strip and stainless semi finished products 
record levels of imported hot rolled steel eroded the market price for non contract spot steel sales 
other operations net sales derived from the company s other operations totaled in compared to in operating profit attributable to these operations were in and in the decline in net sales and operating profit were primarily due to lower snowfalls in the winter of  that adversely affected snowplow sales  as well as a general oversupply in the market for tubular products 
impact of raw material costs and sales revenue on anticipated year results late in  prevailing market prices for most raw materials used in the steel manufacturing process began to escalate sharply 
unlike many of the key raw materials used by the company  such as iron ore  coal and limestone  for which the company has long term contracts  carbon steel slabs and scrap  as well as certain blast furnace additives  can only be acquired on a spot basis and there is no organized market that would enable the company to hedge its exposure to rising prices 
prices for steel scrap  which the company melts and recycles in its basic steel manufacturing operations  are expected to average about per ton higher in than in carbon steel slabs  which the company purchases from other steel producers to supplement its own production  are expected to cost approximately per ton more in than in the company purchases about million tons annually of carbon scrap and  as a result of the increased finishing capabilities of its rockport works  expects to purchase approximately  tons of carbon steel slabs in the increased costs of these materials  as well as other raw materials  are expected to result in an overall increase of approximately in the company s raw material costs in compared to approximately of the company s steel sales are made pursuant to relatively long term agreements one to three years  primarily with the major automotive manufacturers 
consistent with customary industry practice  the company s long term sales agreements with carbon steel customers do not provide for price escalation in the event of rising raw material costs 
during the past few years  selling prices have been under pressure as a result of imports  domestic increases in capacity and intensified efforts by automotive producers to reduce their own manufacturing costs 
the company estimates that  on average  in its selling prices under these agreements will be approximately lower than in  although the decrease will be partly offset by projected increases in the percentage of total shipments attributable to higher priced  higher margin value added cold rolled  coated and stainless products 
because of increased demand  the company expects to realize an average price increase of in its spot market sales 
on balance  the company expects that it will realize an overall increase of to in average selling price for steel products in although the company s operating costs in are expected to benefit from realized cost based synergies of its merger with armco and continuing improvements in productivity  these benefits will be materially offset by the anticipated increase in the company s raw material costs and lower pricing on long term sales agreements
