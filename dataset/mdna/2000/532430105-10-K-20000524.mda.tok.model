item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s earnings are impacted by significant increases in paper prices 
in order to mitigate this risk  the company implemented a price protection program beginning in september by signing a collar hedge contract with enron capital and trade resources corporation 
this four year contract covers  short tons of a certain grade of paper which the company uses  among other grades  to produce its catalogs 
there is a floor and ceiling to paper prices within the contract 
if paper prices remain within the range of the contract  there will be no payment to either party to the contract 
if paper prices exceed the established ceiling  the company will be reimbursed by the counterparty for the excess 
conversely  if paper prices fall below the established floor  the company would pay the counterparty 
the company did not pay a premium in connection with the establishment of the contract 
no amounts are required to be recorded in the accompanying financial statements 
as of february   market prices for paper remained within the ranges specified in the contract and as a result  no payments have been required to be made by either party under the agreement 
the company has performed a sensitivity analysis to determine what the impact would be under the hedge contract if the price of paper covered by this contract were to change by over the next months 
the current price as of february  for the grade of paper subject to this contract is per short ton 
if the price of this grade of paper should increase by over the next months  there would be no payment to the company by the counterparty 
if the price of this grade of paper should decrease by over the next months  the company would be required to make payment to the counterparty 
however  any payments made would be offset by the corresponding cost savings the company would achieve in the lower prices it would pay for its purchases of paper 
therefore  the overall cost would not be material to the company s consolidated statement of income  balance sheet or statement of cash flows as of february
