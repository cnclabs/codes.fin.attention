also  selling and marketing expenses increased as the company continued to invest significantly in new product development  retail account expansion and distribution channel gains 
these investments have resulted in increased placement of cobra products as well as gross margin improvement

in the fourth quarter of  due to the continued positive trend in earnings and the successful launch of the company s new products  management concluded that there was no need for a valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that all of the net deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings 
in the future  the company will report a tax provision since the deferred tax valuation allowance no longer exists to offset any tax expense

also contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative costs was consulting expense incurred to make the company s data processing systems year compliant and higher legal and related costs incurred to register and protect the company s trademarks worldwide

at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of million 
liquidity and capital resources on december   the company had a million secured credit agreement with two financial institutions for a three year revolving credit facility that expires february  loans outstanding under the new agreement bear interest  at the company s option  at the prime rate or libor plus percent 
the credit agreement specifies that the company may not pay cash dividends and contains a material adverse change clause  which  under certain circumstances  could accelerate the payment of the debt 
the company classifies the debt as short term for financial reporting purposes 
at december   the company had approximately million available under the credit line 
the company also has a million secured credit agreement with the same institutions under which borrowings are secured by the cash surrender value of certain life insurance policies owned by the company 
to date  there have been no borrowings under this agreement  which expires on august  net cash flows from operating activities were million for the year ended december  operating cash flows were generated principally from net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million and a million reduction in inventories 
also contributing to the net cash flows from operating activities were a million decrease in receivables and a million increase in accrued liabilities offset by an million increase in other assets and a million increase in other current assets 
inventories decreased mainly because of the strong fourth quarter sales and lower inventories of cordless telephone products  a business that the company exited in receivables decreased because of a large payment which was due at december   but was paid in early january accrued liabilities increased primarily because higher fourth quarter sales led to higher customer advertising program accruals 
other assets increased primarily due to an increase in the cash surrender value of officer s life insurance 
investing activities required cash of million in  principally for the purchase of tooling and equipment 
financing activities used cash flows of million in  reflecting net repayments of the company s borrowings under its line of credit agreement  partially offset by the repurchase of  shares of company common stock for an aggregate cost of  in august  the company s board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock 
on may   the company announced that a second repurchase program has been approved to acquire up to another million of common stock 
through december   the company has repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of  at december   the company had no material commitments  other than approximately million in outstanding purchase orders for products compared with million at the end of the prior year 
working capital requirements are seasonal  with demand for working capital being higher later in the year as customers begin purchasing for the holiday selling season 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and from borrowings under its credit agreement will be sufficient in to fund its working capital needs 
in addition  the majority of any taxable income in and the forseeable future will be offset by net operating loss carryforwards that totaled million at december  until the company has utilized its net operating loss carryforwards  the cash payment of federal income taxes will be minimal 
year the company  with the assistance of an outside consultant  completed its year remediation program during the program included replacing some computer hardware and modifying some of the software used in the conduct of its business 
the company also queried all of its major customers and vendors as to their preparedness 
the responses received indicate that the company s major customers and vendors are year compliant 
the final total cost to the company of these year compliance activities was approximately to date  the company has not experienced any significant year related interruptions or failures and does not believe that any of its major customers or vendors have experienced any such problems that would be expected to have an adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
nevertheless  it is possible that year related interruptions or failures could occur in the future 
the failure to correct a year problem could interrupt  or result in a failure of  normal business operations and consequently materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
while the company believes its own hardware and software are year compliant  the year readiness of the company s customers and vendors is inherently uncertain and beyond the company s control 
accordingly  the company cannot determine at this time whether the consequences of year interruptions or failures will materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company has not developed formal contingency plans to date 
however  as described under item business in this report  the company has a network of suppliers and the company does not enter into long term supply contracts 
the company believes that  if necessary  other suppliers could be found 
as stated above  the company is not aware that any of its major customers have experienced any year related interruptions or failures that would be expected to have an adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in the event a major customer is not year compliant  the company believes that such non compliance would be unlikely to materially affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
item a market risk and financial instruments the company is subject to market risk associated principally with changes in interest rates 
interest rate exposure is principally limited to the million of debt of the company outstanding at december  the debt is priced at interest rates that float with the market  which therefore minimizes interest rate exposure 
a basis point movement in the interest rate on the floating rate debt would result in an approximately  increase or decrease in interest expense and cash flows 
the company does not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for trading or other purposes 
the company s suppliers are located in foreign countries  principally in the far east  and the company made approximately of its sales outside the united states in  however  the company minimizes its foreign currency exchange rate risk by conducting all of its transactions in us dollars
