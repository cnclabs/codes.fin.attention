management believes that the decline in open market sales is primarily attributable to recent changes in the procurement regulations that allow the government to purchase products by other means eg gsa schedule contracts  government wide agency contract gwac  blanket purchase agreements bpa s in a quicker and easier manner than was the case before such changes 
in addition  the decrease in sales under gsa schedule contracts can be attributed primarily to decreased sales relating to gsa schedule b c contract of million offset by an increase in bpa sales of million from the same period last year 
in  gsa schedule contracts expressly authorized agencies to procure from schedule holders under bpa s which incorporate many terms and conditions of the gsa schedule contracts

the net interest expense increased approximately  or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was due primarily to increased average borrowings as a result of increased sales volumes  as well as additional borrowings required for the btg division acquisition 
in addition  during the company utilized more prompt payment discounts as compared to the same period in income taxes 
no provision for income tax has been recognized with respect to the company s income from operations for due to the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance that fully offset the company s current tax expenses for new accounting pronouncements sfas  earnings per share  and sfas  disclosure of information about capital structure  were adopted by the company in the fourth quarter of  with no material effect on the company s consolidated financial statement presentation 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income  was adopted by the company in and in accordance therewith  the company s comprehensive income equals reported net income loss 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  was adopted by the company in the fourth quarter of effect of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its operations 
however  in the event inflation increases in the future it could temporarily adversely affect the profitability of gtsi s sales under its government fixed price contracts  which generally preclude the company from passing on inflation related or other increases in product costs to government customers during the term of a pre existing contract 
the company mitigates this risk in part by often obtaining agreements from certain of its suppliers prohibiting them from increasing their prices to gtsi during fixed price  term contracts 
seasonal fluctuations and other factors the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in its operations as a result of government buying and funding patterns  which also impact the buying patterns of gtsi s prime contractor customers 
these buying and funding patterns historically have had a significant positive effect on gtsi s bookings in the third quarter ending september each year the government s fiscal year end  and consequently on sales and net income in the third and fourth quarters of each year 
quarterly financial results are also affected by the timing of the award of and shipments of products under government contracts  price competition in the microcomputer and workstation industries  the addition of personnel or other expenses in anticipation of sales growth  product line changes and expansions  and the timing and costs of changes in customer and product mix 
in addition  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new product releases by leading microcomputer and workstation hardware and software manufacturers  delays in vendor shipments of new or existing products  a shift in sales mix to more complex requirements contracts with more complex service costs  and vendor delays in the processing of incentives and credits due gtsi  have occurred all of which are also likely to occur in the future and have adversely affected the company s operating performance in particular periods 
the seasonality and the unpredictability of the factors affecting such seasonality make gtsi s quarterly and yearly financial results difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuation 
the company s stock price could be adversely affected if any such financial results fail to meet the financial community s expectations 
additionally  legislation is periodically introduced in congress that may change the government s procurement practices 
gtsi cannot predict whether any legislative or any regulatory proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  the impact upon its operating results 
changes in the structure  composition and or buying patterns of the government  either alone or in combination with competitive conditions or other factors  could adversely affect future results
