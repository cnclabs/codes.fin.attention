working capital is required to fund adequate levels of inventories and accounts receivable 
capital expenditures totaled and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these capital expenditures reflect our ongoing commitment to maintain safe  efficient plants and continually increase productivity 
commitments for capital expenditures at may  were not significant  however  it is estimated that gross capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending may  will approximate to of net sales and revenue 
additional expenditures in fy are possible in line with growth in earnings and cash flow  or expansion opportunities in certain markets 
because the company s operating cash flow is significantly influenced by the general economy and  in particular  levels of domestic construction activity  current results should not necessarily be used to predict the company s liquidity  capital expenditures  investment in instalment notes receivable or results of operations 
the company believes that the mid state trust v variable funding loan agreement will provide mid state with the funds needed to purchase the instalment notes and mortgages generated by jim walter homes and its affiliates

the company is subject to interest rate risk on its existing credit facilities  trust v variable funding loan  and any future financing requirements

the company has historically managed interest rate risk through the periodic use of interest rate hedging instruments 
there were no such instruments outstanding at may  while the company can not predict its ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on its existing debt  management continues to evaluate its financial position on an ongoing basis 
the company is at risk on its portfolio of instalment notes receivable 
the company s instalment notes receivables are fixed rate and have terms ranging from to years 
the company manages its risk by securitizing its instalment notes into asset backed trust agreements funded by fixed rate debt 
therefore  the company s asset liability management requires a high degree of analysis and estimation 
the company is also subject to a limited amount of foreign currency risk  but does not currently engage in any significant foreign currency hedging transactions to manage exposure for transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
year disclosure the company s year yk compliance project determined the readiness of the company s business for the year the company defined yk compliance to mean that the computer code will process all defined future dates properly and give accurate results
