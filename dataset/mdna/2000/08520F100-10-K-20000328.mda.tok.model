within language services  els boc revenues declined from the prior year 
els boc was affected by weakened asian student enrollments due to the economic conditions in the far east 
enrollments from latin america were also down due to economic instability in venezuela and brazil  and the increased strength of the dollar over the currencies in these countries 
aggressive pricing and agent commission structures by competitors also adversely affected results 
in addition  due to organization changes and the relocation of the els headquarters from los angeles to princeton in the latter part of  many overseas sales agents did not sell the els programs aggressively in the latter months of and early part of due to perceived uncertainties about the future of els programs

footnotes continued on next page the decline in instruction operating ebita was due mainly to weakness in the us  poland  and certain latin american countries 
in the us  growth in teacher salaries  rent and certain other fixed costs  coupled with a lesson volume decline  led to lower ebita and ebita margins 
in latin america  economic uncertainty in argentina  brazil  colombia and venezuela led to ebita declines in these countries 
in poland  the ebita was negatively affected by new legislation on teachers social security 
the decreases in these countries were partially offset by ebita increases primarily in mexico  japan and most european countries  notably  france  uk  denmark  and spain 
despite reductions in its overall costs from the prior year  els boc s ebita and ebita margin decreased because the percentage decline in els revenues outpaced the percentage decline of certain costs most notably teachers salaries  advertising and certain fixed expenses

these declines were partially offset by increased production in norway  and increased activity in france and poland from acquisitions made in the second and fourth quarters of  respectively 
corporate expenses rose due to increases in salary and related costs  and other sundry expenses 
the reduction in instruction s ebita margin occurred primarily as teacher costs  rent and salary related costs grew faster than revenues

on december   the securities and exchange commission sec issued its staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which provided its views on applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues

through december  such amounts had been recognized in income based on historical experience by country  refunds subsequently issued were not material 
beginning in  deferred revenues on lessons paid for but not expected to be taken were recognized in income when the obligation to issue a refund has constructively expired
