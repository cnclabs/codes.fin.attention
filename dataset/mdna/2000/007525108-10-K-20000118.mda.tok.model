factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in risk factors  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be required to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
general we provide hardware and software based data storage solutions to the open systems marketplace 
our storage solutions integrate into a wide range of rapidly evolving network computing environments and are designed to enable organizations to organize  protect and retrieve complex mission critical data 
we design  manufacture  sell and support specialized data storage hardware and software products and provide related services 
currently  we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of storage libraries and related service and support 
as a result of our investments in software development  we expect sales of our proprietary software products to increase in the future 
we distribute our products primarily through value added resellers vars  and original equipment manufacturers oems  and we also sell directly to large end users 
since  our general trends include growth in sales of library products  growth in international sales  a reduction in sales of standalone digital linear tape dlt drives and growth in our oem business 
gross profit margins depend on a number of factors  including customer and product mix  price competition and tape drive costs 
we cannot assure you that we can maintain our gross margin levels 
in august  we acquired emass  inc for million in cash and the assumption of million in indebtedness  and expensed million of acquired in process research and development 
emass established our presence in denver and expanded our operations in europe 
this acquisition brought with it certain product offerings  including large scale libraries and proprietary software products designed to operate in conjunction with our hardware products and the hardware products of our competitors 
additionally  we gained a field service organization which now serves our combined business 
the acquisition of emass resulted in increases in our net sales  selling and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
however  as a result of the complete integration of the emass business into our existing business  we do not separately track the operating results of the former emass business 
on september   we acquired mountaingate imaging systems corporation 
in connection with the acquisition  we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock  paid  cash and assumed approximately million of mountaingate s debt 
this acquisition brought with it centravision  a storage area network san software technology 
we expensed million of acquired in process research and development associated with centravision software 
foreign currency gains or losses arise as a result of our operation of european subsidiaries  the functional currencies of which are the french franc  german mark and british pound sterling 
all monetary assets are translated into the functional currencies on the financial statements of these subsidiaries 
some us dollar receivables and payables in these subsidiaries offset each other to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses 
to the extent that these monetary assets and liabilities do not fully offset each other and the us dollar exchange rate changes with respect to these currencies  transaction gains or losses may result 
for large sales denominated in other currencies  we attempt to implement appropriate hedging strategies 
fiscal year compared to net sales 
net sales in fiscal increased to million compared with net sales of million in fiscal this increase reflects the recognition of revenue associated with the emass business for all of fiscal compared with recognition for two months of fiscal  as well as strong sales growth across our major product lines in both our branded products and oem business 
revenue from branded products increased in fiscal to million 
revenue from oems was million or of total revenue for fiscal and million or of total revenue for fiscal revenue from a single oem was in fiscal these oem sales consisted primarily of the small library faststor products 
net sales outside the united states accounted for of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit was million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the increase was due to a shift in product mix toward higher margin tape libraries  software and service  and away from lower margin standalone tape drives and media  as well as the effects of overall volume increases 
gross profit in fiscal was adversely impacted by higher overhead with our new washington facility  increases in personnel to support our oem business  and lower than anticipated product revenues 
the cost of direct material  including tape drives  comprised a substantial majority of cost of sales in fiscal and selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the dollar increase in selling and administrative expenses was due to increased sales and administrative personnel both in the headquarters office and in regional offices throughout the united states and increased advertising and promotion costs 
the slight percentage decrease in selling and administrative expenses was due to the increase in net sales 
acquired in process technology 
in connection with the acquisitions of mountaingate in fiscal and emass in fiscal  acquired in process technology was identified and valued by an independent third party and was expensed immediately 
in each case  the value of acquired in process technology was determined by estimating the stage of development of each in process research and development project at the date of acquisition and estimating cash flows resulting from anticipated revenues generated from such projects  and then discounting the projected net cash flow 
in the case of mountaingate  the acquired in process technology was valued at million  approximately of the total assets acquired 
the project we are currently pursuing is an nt version of the centravision product that will also include many new features required to function in the enterprise open solutions market 
we expect to incur significant costs to develop the acquired in process technology into a commercially viable product 
costs include engineering time and material  in addition to costs associated with beta versions and testing 
the valuation of the in process technology included estimates of the costs to complete the nt version of centravision of approximately million 
we expect that this product will be released in the third quarter of fiscal approximately  of costs were incurred from the date of acquisition through october   and as of october  the costs and timing of the project were consistent with the initial estimates of mountaingate management 
development expenses incurred subsequent to september   the date of acquisition  are included in research and development expenses 
we believe that this project will be successfully developed  however  if it is not  our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods 
in addition  the failure of the project could impair the value of other intangible assets acquired and adversely affect our sales and profitability in future periods 
acquired in process technology of emass was valued at million  approximately of the total assets acquired 
projects we are currently pursuing include a new large library storage product and associated software  as well as separate software products using unix and windows nt platforms 
of the total value of acquired in process technology  was associated with the in process library products and with the in process software products 
we expect that these products  if successfully developed  will replace existing large library and software products 
we expect that customer service and maintenance contracts will  however  continue to provide revenue associated with the older products 
we expect to continue to incur costs to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products 
costs include engineering time and material  in addition to costs associated with prototype and test systems 
the valuation of the in process technology included estimates of the costs to complete the new large library storage product and associated software of approximately million 
we expect that these products will be released in the fourth quarter of fiscal approximately million and  of costs were incurred from the date of acquisition through october  and  respectively 
estimates of the costs to complete the separate software amass products utilizing unix and nt platforms were approximately  approximately million of costs have been incurred through october  amass nt was released in the third quarter of fiscal  and the other software products are expected to be released in the second and third quarters of fiscal we will continue to incur development costs through such dates 
expenses incurred subsequent to august are included in research and development expenses 
we believe that each of these projects will be successfully developed  however  if they are not  our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods 
in addition  the failure of any particular project could impair the value of other intangible assets acquired and adversely affect our sales and profitability in future periods 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal much of this increase relates to an emphasis on software based products 
approximately of the fiscal research and development spending was related to software based products 
we intend to maintain this level of research and development spending  relative to net sales  as we continue investing heavily in software development and new hardware products 
other income expense 
interest income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal this increase in interest income is the result of higher cash balances reflecting our follow on offering which was completed in september 
interest expense of  in fiscal relates to interest on a bank loan primarily used to finance the acquisition of emass and to operating credit lines through a german bank 
all us bank debt was paid off at october  the gain on sale of marketable equity securities relates to investments in certain securities made during fiscal and sold during fiscal provision for income taxes 
income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal includes taxes paid in various federal  state and international jurisdictions 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal was negatively impacted by certain  one time  non deductible expense associated with the mountaingate acquisition 
there are significant deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences associated with subsidiaries acquired in the emass transaction 
at october  a full valuation allowance had been established on these deferred tax assets 
during fiscal we determined that it was more likely than not that we could realize the deferred tax assets and consequently reduced the previously established valuation allowance by million 
we reduced the valuation of certain noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition by the same amount 
at october  we had a valuation allowance of million  which if reduced will lower our effective income tax rate in future years 
fiscal year compared to net sales 
net sales in fiscal increased to million compared with net sales of million in fiscal the increase in net sales relates both to an increase in sales of small libraries and to the inclusion of emass sales in the fourth quarter of the year  offset by a significant decrease in standalone tape drive and media sales between fiscal and the increase in small library sales is due to market growth as well as to oem sales under agreements entered into during fiscal these oem sales consisted primarily of the faststor products introduced in the final quarter of fiscal the transition during fiscal of dlt tape drives  supplied by quantum  from a condition of supply constraint to one of general availability was a major factor in the reduction in the sales of standalone dlt tape drives and a reduction in sales to distributors and resellers as they reduced their inventories of these products 
tape drives purchased from third party manufacturers  primarily dlt drives  involve rapidly changing technology 
to remain competitive  we sometimes reduce prices on our library products in response to the decreases in purchased tape drive cost 
primarily due to declining tape drive prices  in fiscal  we lowered prices on certain library and other products 
sales to our top two customers were of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal year international sales were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  accounting for of net sales in both fiscal years 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease is the result of many factors including higher overhead associated with the new washington facility  increases in personnel to support our oem business  and lower than anticipated product revenues  particularly in the third quarter 
gross profit margins decreased further due to certain product price reductions 
these factors more than offset the benefit of a shift in product mix toward higher margin libraries and away from lower margin standalone products 
the gross profit percentage in the fourth quarter benefited from the larger libraries and software sales of emass but was reduced by a  charge to cost of goods sold as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to record emass inventory at its fair market value 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses in fiscal were million or of sales  compared with million or of sales in fiscal the increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales is due to increased sales personnel in our headquarters  regional and international sales offices  increased advertising and promotion costs and increased costs associated with our new headquarters facility 
in addition  with the purchase of emass we acquired duplicative assets consisting of computer systems to track product serial numbers and customer service information 
these assets totaled  and were expensed subsequent to the acquisition 
acquired in process technology 
in connection with the purchase of emass in august  the existence of acquired in process technology was determined and valued by an independent third party appraisal 
as discussed in more detail above  the value associated with this intangible asset of million  approximately of the total purchase price  was expensed immediately 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million or of net sales for the year ended october  compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the dollar and percentage increases are both related to our significant expenditures associated with both hardware and software in process technology 
other income expense 
interest income of million for fiscal was comparable to fiscal interest income of million 
interest expense incurred in fiscal of  represented interest from august to october  on a bank loan  the proceeds of which were used to partially finance the acquisition of emass 
the gain on sale of marketable securities relates to investments in certain equity securities that were sold in fiscal foreign currency gains or losses arise as a result of the operation of our european subsidiaries  adic europe and grau 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal was million  which represented an effective tax rate of of pre tax income 
the expense associated with the write off of acquired in process technology is not deductible for state or federal income tax purposes 
without this expense  the effective tax rate would have been 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was  which reflected our investment in certain nontaxable bonds as well as the utilization of certain credits for increasing research activities 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal in each of these periods  operating cash was primarily used to fund increases in accounts receivable and inventories and was offset by net income  depreciation and other allowances and accounts payable growth 
additionally  in fiscal and  net income was reduced by the expensing of acquired in process technology  a noncash item 
other noncash items in fiscal include an increase in the allowance for inventory obsolescence of million 
as our installed base of library products has increased  the need for service and warranty repair inventory  especially inventory at regional locations to support on site service  has also increased 
we have provided an allowance against these inventories  as well as for inventories used for demonstration purposes  in addition to our allowance for excess and obsolescence 
because these inventories can remain in the field for an extended time  the amount of this allowance has increased substantially over the past two years 
cash flows used in investing activities were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal fiscal includes a million investment in network integrity  inc  a million investment in backup  an internet based backup and data access service company  ongoing investments in property  plant  equipment and marketable equity securities  proceeds from the sales of marketable equity securities and approximately  for cash related to acquisitions 
our investing activities in fiscal were primarily associated with the acquisition of emass in august in connection with this acquisition  we acquired assets with a fair value of million and assumed million of liabilities 
included with emass s assets was million in cash 
additionally  we invested in property  plant and equipment  primarily associated with our new headquarters facility and various technology additions and upgrades  and also invested in certain marketable equity securities  some of which were sold later in the year 
in august  we used million to acquire a minority equity position in crossroads systems  inc  a provider of fibre channel interconnection products 
we used an additional million to purchase plant and equipment in fiscal cash flows provided by financing activities were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal in september we completed our follow on stock offering of million and repaid substantially all our long term debt 
in june  we finalized two operating lines provided by german banks totaling approximately million in german marks and borrowed the entire amount 
these short term loans are scheduled to be repaid may and bear interest at each bank s rate  approximately through november additionally  in june we refinanced our mortgage loan collateralized by our german facility totaling approximately million in german marks 
in august  we received proceeds from long term borrowings of million 
in march  we completed a public offering of stock that provided cash of million 
at october   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  up from million at october  our working capital  the difference between current assets and current liabilities  was million at october   with a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to we have a million bank line of credit that expires in february  all of which was available as of october  borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at the bank s reference rate or an adjusted libor rate 
a credit agreement covers the line of credit and long term note payable and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios and levels of working capital  tangible net worth and profitability 
we had no material or unusual commitments as of october  other than annual rental commitments 
additionally  at october   our investment in crossroads systems  inc had a market value of  the market for technology stocks is extremely volatile and there is no assurance that we will realize this value when and if we liquidate our investment in crossroads 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  bank line of credit  and anticipated cash flow from our operating activities  will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we may utilize cash to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that we believe are strategic 
we regularly evaluate other companies and technologies for possible acquisition by us 
in addition  we have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in companies with whom we have identified potential synergies 
however  we have no present commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisition of other businesses  products or technologies 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
fas establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components with the same prominence as other financial statements and has been implemented 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

fas has been implemented 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards no

fas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
fas defers the effective date until the fiscal year ending october  we will adopt fas in our quarter ending january  and do not expect such adoption to have an impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
this pronouncement summarizes certain of the sec staff s views on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
we are required to adopt sab for our fiscal year ending october  we are currently reviewing the requirements of sab  but do not expect such adoption to have an impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
market risk management we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency rates and interest rates 
we may enter into various derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar  and are translated in us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
a depreciation in the us dollar would result in an approximately  decrease in income before provision for income taxes for fiscal at october   we had variable rate debt of approximately million provided by german banks  and fixed rate debt of million  also provided by a german bank 
the fair value of such debt approximates the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet at october  market risk is estimated as the potential for interest rates to increase on the variable rate debt 
any such increase would be immaterial to the consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement on the variable rate debt  which beginning in december fixes the interest rate at 
impact of european monetary conversion we are aware of the issues associated with the changes in europe resulting from the formation of a european economic and monetary union 
one change resulting from this union required european monetary union  or emu  member states to irrevocably fix their respective currencies to a new currency  the euro  as of january   at which date the euro became a functional legal currency of these countries 
during the next three years  business in the emu member states will be conducted in both the existing national currency  such as the french franc or the german mark  and the euro 
as a result  companies operating or conducting business in emu member states will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling these currencies  including the euro 
we are still assessing the impact that the conversion to the euro will have on our internal systems  the sale of our products and the european and global economies 
we will take appropriate corrective actions based on the results of such assessment 
we have not yet determined the cost related to addressing this issue 
year readiness disclosure many computers  software and other equipment include computer code in which calendar year data is abbreviated to only two digits 
as a result  some of these systems could fail to operate or fail to produce correct results if is interpreted to mean  rather than this error could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
products 
we believe the current versions of our hardware and software products are year compliant 
all new products are being designed to be year compliant 
while most of our internally manufactured library products have no date functionality built into them  this is not true for certain software and large library products 
year compliant upgrades are currently available for all of these products  and our service personnel are able to install these upgrades in conjunction with routine maintenance 
in addition  we reviewed hardware used in connection with certain large library products  replaced certain systems that could not be made compliant and upgraded those that could 
we estimate that the total costs to replace this hardware approximate  all of which has been expended 
these costs were partially reimbursed by customers 
we cannot be assured that all of our existing products will contain all necessary date codes 
further  use of our products in connection with other products that are not year compliant  including noncompliant hardware  software and firmware  may result in the inaccurate exchange of dates and result in performance problems or system failure 
any failure of our products to perform could result in claims against us 
the cost of defending any such claim which may arise  as well as any liability for year related damages  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
internal information technology systems 
our business depends on numerous systems potentially vulnerable to year related problems 
we modified such systems as needed  and replaced several network servers and various other pieces of equipment and software at a cost of approximately  based on our assessments  software vendor certification and our experience to date  we believe that the enterprise resource planning computer systems at our various manufacturing sites are year compliant 
systems other than information technology systems 
in addition to computers and related systems  the operation of office and facilities equipment  such as fax machines  telephone switches  security systems and other common devices  could be affected by year problems 
we assessed the potential effect and costs of remediating the year problem on our office equipment and facilities and replaced certain equipment at an immaterial cost 
to date  we have not experienced significant year problems in operational systems  equipment and facilities 
suppliers 
our reliance on key suppliers  and therefore on the proper function of their information systems and software  means that their failure to address year issues could have a material impact on our operations and financial results 
we asked key suppliers to provide information regarding their readiness for year related issues  received responses from substantially all of them  reviewed the responses and believe no further actions are required to mitigate vulnerability to problems with suppliers and other third parties systems 
we made provisions to carry approximately one month of inventory of certain critical and custom parts to help us mitigate any supplier risk 
year costs 
we incurred primarily internal staff cost and other expenses related to infrastructure and facilities enhancements necessary to prepare our systems for the year we also utilized a third party to do additional testing of our enterprise resource planning computer system in redmond 
there were no material direct out of pocket costs in these areas 
contingency plans 
we developed contingency plans to be implemented in the event of critical year problems 
the extent of existing but undetected year problems remains unknown  but to date  there has been no need to implement our contingency plans 
worst case scenario 
we believe that the most likely worst case scenario related to the year issue that we could experience would be either an inability to obtain inventory components from suppliers or delays in receiving orders or payments from customers due to year problems experienced by these third parties 
if either of these events transpires  we could experience decreased revenue due to our inability to produce and ship our products or our inability to collect payments due to us in a timely fashion 
disclaimer 
the discussion of our efforts and ongoing expectations relating to year compliance include some forward looking statements 
we cannot be certain that we will not incur additional  unanticipated costs  losses or liabilities related to internal or third party year problems not yet known to us 
such costs  losses and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results
