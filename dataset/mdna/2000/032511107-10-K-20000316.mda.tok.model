the company s average wellhead gas price in was up over anadarko s average wellhead gas price in had decreased from natural gas markets improved in  with the company s average price increasing from per mcf in to per mcf in the stronger prices were the result of lower nation wide production volumes and higher gas demand  particularly from electric power generation facilities 
natural gas markets were volatile in  with the company s average monthly price fluctuating from a high of per mcf in january to a low of per mcf in september anadarko employs marketing strategies to help manage production and sales volumes and mitigate the effect of the price volatility  which is likely to continue in the future

production of oil usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand or in market prices 
anadarko s average crude oil price for increased compared to the improvement in crude oil prices for was due in large part to a decrease in the production quotas among the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec 
crude oil prices in were down compared to the company s ngls sales volumes in were essentially flat compared to ngls sales volumes in increased compared to primarily due to the restructuring of processing agreements in late the average ngls price was up compared to by comparison  ngls prices were below ngls production is dependent on natural gas prices and the economics of processing the natural gas volumes to extract ngls 
marketing strategies natural gas the us natural gas market has grown significantly throughout the last years and management believes continued growth to be likely 
natural gas prices have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be so 
management believes the company s excellent portfolio of exploration and development prospects should position anadarko to continue to participate in this growth 
anadarko s wholly owned marketing subsidiary anadarko energy services company aes is a full service marketing company offering supply assurance  competitive pricing and services tailored to its customers needs 
most of the company s gas production is sold through aes 
aes also purchases and sells third party gas in the company s market areas 
aes sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer 
aes has expanded its marketing capabilities to move larger volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility 
included in this strategy is the use of leased natural gas storage facilities and various hedging strategies to better manage price risk associated with natural gas sales 
see use of derivatives under item a of this form k 
crude oil and condensate anadarko s revenues are derived from production in the us and algeria 
presently  most of the company s us crude oil production is sold on day evergreen contracts with prices based on postings plus a premium 
oil from the hbns field in algeria is lifted by tanker load and sold as saharan blend to customers primarily in the mediterranean area 
saharan blend is a very high quality crude that provides refiners with large quantities of premium products like high quality jet and diesel fuel 
aes purchases and sells third party crude oil and condensate in the company s domestic and international market areas 
gas gathering systems and processing anadarko s investment in gas gathering operations allows the company to better manage its gas production  improve ultimate recovery of reserves  enhance the value of gas production and expand marketing opportunities 
the company has invested million to build or acquire gas gathering systems over the last five years 
anadarko owns and operates four major gas gathering systems in the company s core producing areas 
in  anadarko sold its hemphill gathering system in southwest kansas 
the company s overall gas gathering capacity is more than mmcf d and serves about  wells 
approximately of the gas flowing through these systems is from anadarko operated wells 
the company processes gas at various third party plants under agreements generally structured to provide for the extraction and sale of ngls in efficient plants with flexible commitments 
the company has agreements with six plants in the mid continent area and eight plants in the gulf coast area 
anadarko s strategy to aggregate gas through company owned and third party gathering systems allows anadarko to secure processing arrangements in each of the regions where the company has significant production 
operating results drilling activity during  anadarko participated in a total of gross wells  including oil wells  gas wells and dry holes 
this compares to gross wells oil wells  gas wells and dry holes in and gross wells oil wells  gas wells and dry holes in the decline in activity during and is a direct result of lower commodity prices

reserve replacement drilling activity is not the best measure of success for an exploration and production company 
anadarko focuses on growth and profitability 
reserve replacement is the key to growth and future profitability depends on the cost of finding oil and gas reserves  among other factors 
the company believes its performance in both areas is excellent 
for the th consecutive year  anadarko more than replaced annual production volumes with proved reserves of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls  stated on an energy equivalent barrel eeb basis 
during  anadarko s worldwide reserve replacement was of total production which reached a record of mmeebs 
the company s worldwide reserve replacement in was of total production of mmeebs 
the company s worldwide reserve replacement in was of total production 
over the last five years  the company s annual reserve replacement has averaged of annual production volumes 
anadarko continues to increase its energy reserves in the us while the nation s energy reserves have been declining over the past ten years 
in  the company replaced of its us production volumes with us reserves 
this compares to a us reserve replacement of of production volumes in the company s us reserve replacement for the five year period was of production 
by comparison  the most recent published us industry average was 
source us department of energy anadarko s us reserve replacement performance for the same period was of production 
industry data for are not yet available 
cost of finding cost of finding results in any one year can be misleading due to the long lead times associated with exploration and development 
a better measure of cost of finding performance is over a five year period 
anadarko has consistently outperformed the industry in average finding costs 
for the period  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per eeb 
the company s us finding performance for the same period was per eeb 
industry data for are not yet available 
for comparison purposes  the most recent published five year average for the industry shows worldwide finding cost was per eeb and us finding cost was per eeb 
source arthur andersen for the same five year period of  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per eeb and its us finding cost was per eeb 
the company s low finding costs are due to the success of anadarko s exploration programs 
for  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per eeb compared to per eeb in and per eeb in anadarko s us finding cost for was per eeb compared to per eeb in and per eeb in proved reserves at the end of  anadarko s proved reserves were mmeebs compared to mmeebs at year end and mmeebs at year end reserves increased by in compared to due primarily to exploration and development drilling in both the us and overseas 
anadarko s proved reserves have grown by over the past three years  primarily as a result of successful exploration projects in alaska  algeria and the gulf of mexico  as well as successful exploitation and development drilling programs in major domestic fields in core areas onshore and offshore and producing property acquisitions 
the company s proved natural gas reserves at year end were trillion cubic feet tcf  compared to tcf at year end and tcf at year end anadarko s proved us gas reserves have increased since year end  reflecting two major discoveries in the gulf of mexico s sub salt trend and continued development activity onshore in the us anadarko s crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves at year end increased to million barrels mmbbls  compared to mmbbls at year end and mmbbls at year end crude oil reserves have risen by over the last three years primarily due to large discoveries in alaska  algeria and the gulf of mexico 
crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves comprise of the company s proved reserves at year end  compared to about at year end and at year end the company emphasizes that the volumes of reserves are estimates which  by their nature  are subject to revision 
the estimates are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional performance data 
at december   the present value discounted at of future net revenues from anadarko s proved reserves was billion  before income taxes  and was billion  after income taxes  stated in accordance with the regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec and financial accounting standards board 
the estimated present value of future net revenues  after income taxes  increased compared to due primarily to significantly higher crude oil and slightly higher natural gas prices at year end and additions of proved reserves related to successful drilling worldwide 
see supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities in the consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the present value of future net revenues does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of anadarko s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves  and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
acquisitions and divestitures the company s strategy also includes an active asset acquisition and divestiture program 
during  anadarko acquired through purchases and trades mmeebs of proved reserves for million 
during the same time period  the company sold properties  either as a strategic exit from a certain area or asset rationalization in existing core areas  with proceeds totaling million 
reserves associated with these sales and trades were mmeebs 
during  anadarko sold reserves of mmeebs  of which mmeebs were attributed to the company s non operated interests in algeria blocks a and a 
the agreement million net to anadarko covers contract areas operated by bhp 
the sale allowed anadarko  which had a interest in the contract area  to capture the value of non operated properties and use the proceeds to develop its primary algerian operating areas on blocks and the agreement is subject to approval of state authorities in algeria 
in  anadarko acquired reserves of mmeebs in several transactions totaling million 
the largest acquisition was in the vernon field of jackson parish  louisiana for million 
the interest acquired covers  net acres with producing wells 
in  anadarko acquired reserves of mmeebs in several transactions totaling million 
the largest acquisition was five oil and gas fields in the anadarko basin of central oklahoma  a core operating area of the company for years  which was purchased for million 
the fields cover  gross acres with producing and injection wells 
anadarko s net production from these fields was about mbbls d and mmcf d of gas 
the acquisition also included an interest in a mile  eight inch diameter pipeline that delivers carbon dioxide to the fields and primarily serves third parties 
in  acquisitions of producing properties totaled million and mmeebs 
the largest acquisition was properties in the west panhandle field of texas for million  which accounted for mmeebs of proved reserves 
this purchase provided the company producing properties with significant development potential as well as settling a disputed claim on revenues 
during  anadarko sold reserves of about mmeebs in several transactions with sales proceeds totaling million 
the largest component was the sale of the company s norden ltd 
partnership in colorado in late for million 
producing properties and leases the company owns  net producing oil wells and  net producing gas wells worldwide

a portion of the undeveloped acreage in algeria will be relinquished in the future upon finalization of exploitation license boundaries 
regulatory matters environmental and safety the company s oil and gas operations and properties are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection from the time oil and gas projects commence until abandonment 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment  the issuance of permits in connection with exploration  drilling and production activities  the release of emissions into the atmosphere  the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials  offshore oil and gas operations  the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites 
in addition  these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for the company s failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from the company s operations 
anadarko takes the issue of environmental stewardship very seriously and works diligently to comply with applicable environmental and safety rules and regulations 
compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition in the past 
however  because environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent  there can be no assurances that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
for a description of certain environmental proceedings in which the company is involved  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
other regulatory agencies in certain states and countries have authority to issue permits for seismic exploration and the drilling of wells  regulate well spacing  prevent the waste of oil and gas resources through proration and regulate environmental matters 
operations conducted by the company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions  including various nondiscrimination statutes 
additionally  certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the bureau of land management and the minerals management service of the us department of the interior 
in addition to the standard permit process  federal leases and most international concessions require a complete environmental impact assessment prior to authorizing an exploration or development plan 
additional factors affecting business the company has made in this report  and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings  press releases and discussions with company management  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of concerning the company s operations  economic performance and financial condition 
these forward looking statements include information concerning future production and reserves  schedules  plans  timing of development  contributions from oil and gas properties  and those statements preceded by  followed by or that otherwise include the words believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  projects  target  goal  plans  objective  should or similar expressions or variations on such expressions 
for such statements  the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this form k and in the company s other public filings  press releases and discussions with company management  including commodity pricing and demand crude oil prices continue to be affected by political developments worldwide  pricing decisions and production quotas of opec and the volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures markets 
natural gas prices also continue to be highly volatile 
in periods of sharply lower commodity prices  the company may curtail production and capital spending projects  as well as delay or defer drilling wells in certain areas because of lower cash flows 
changes in crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the company s determination of proved reserves and the company s calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas reserves 
in addition  demand for oil and gas in the us and worldwide may affect the company s level of production 
exploration and operating risks the company s business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and gas  including blowouts  cratering and fire  any of which could result in damage to  or destruction of  oil and gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property and injury to persons 
as protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards  the company maintains insurance coverage  including certain physical damage  employer s liability  comprehensive general liability and worker s compensation insurance 
although anadarko is not fully insured against all risks in its business  the company believes that the coverage it maintains is customary for companies engaged in similar operations 
the occurrence of a significant event against which the company is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
development risks the company is involved in several large development projects 
key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include project approvals by joint venture partners  timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment  and commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons 
in large development projects  these uncertainties are usually resolved  but delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events are commonplace and may  therefore  affect the forward looking statements related to large development projects 
domestic governmental risks the domestic operations of the company have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and by federal  state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production  changes in taxes  royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies  price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection regulations 
foreign operations risk the company s operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  war  insurrection and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the company s international operations 
the company s international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and taxation 
to date  the company s international operations have not been materially affected by these risks 
competition the oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production 
the company s competitors include the major oil companies  independent oil and gas concerns  individual producers  gas marketers and major pipeline companies  as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
kansas ad valorem tax the natural gas policy act of allowed a severance  production or similar tax to be included as an add on  over and above the maximum lawful price for natural gas 
based on the federal energy regulatory commission ferc ruling that the kansas ad valorem tax was such a tax  the company collected the kansas ad valorem tax 
ferc s ruling regarding the ability of producers to collect the kansas ad valorem tax was appealed to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit dc circuit 
the court held in june that ferc failed to provide a reasoned basis for its findings and remanded the case to ferc 
ultimately  the dc circuit issued a decision on august  ruling that producers must refund all kansas ad valorem taxes collected relating to production since october the company filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the supreme court 
that petition was denied on may  anadarko estimates that the maximum amount of principal and interest at issue which has not been paid to date  assuming that the october effective date remains in effect  is about million pretax as of december  for a description of the court proceedings that have occurred  additional action taken by the ferc and litigation filed by the company as a result of the dc circuit decision  see information appearing under kansas ad valorem tax under item of this form k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk use of derivatives anadarko produces  purchases and sells natural gas  crude oil  and ngls 
as a result  anadarko s financial results can be significantly affected by changes in these commodity prices 
anadarko uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge the company s exposure to changes in the market price of natural gas and crude oil  and to provide methods to fix the price for natural gas independently of the physical purchase or sale 
derivative commodity instruments also provide methods to meet customer pricing requirements while achieving a price structure consistent with the company s overall pricing strategy 
while derivative commodity instruments are intended to reduce the company s exposure to declines in the market price of natural gas and crude oil  the derivative commodity instruments may also limit anadarko s gain from increases in the market price of natural gas and crude oil 
as a result  gains and losses on derivative commodity instruments are generally offset by similar changes in the realized price of natural gas and crude oil 
gains and losses are recognized in revenues for the periods to which the derivative commodity instruments relate 
in the event of a loss of correlation between oil and gas reference prices for a derivative commodity instrument and actual oil and gas prices  gains or losses for the amount the instrument has not offset the change in actual prices are recognized in the period 
occasionally  the company may enter into derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in the market price of natural gas and crude oil 
these trading activities do not qualify as hedges of production and are marked to market in the period 
trading gains or losses are recorded with revenues from the corresponding product 
anadarko s derivative commodity instruments currently are comprised of futures  swaps and options contracts 
while the volume of derivative commodity instruments utilized by the company to hedge its market price risk can vary during the year within the boundaries of its established policy guidelines  the fair value of those instruments at december  and was  in the judgment of the company  immaterial 
additionally  through the use of sensitivity analysis the company evaluates separately  for its non trading and trading activities  the potential effect that reasonably possible near term changes in the market prices of natural gas and crude oil may have on the fair value of the company s derivative commodity instruments 
based upon an analysis utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes and assuming a adverse movement in commodity prices  the potential decrease in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments at december  and does not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
anadarko is also exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of the company s variable and fixed interest rate debt as well as fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
the company has evaluated the potential effect that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates may have on the fair value of the company s various debt instruments and its interest rate swap agreements 
based upon an analysis utilizing the actual interest rate in effect as of december  and and assuming a increase in interest rates  the potential increase in interest expense and the potential decrease in the fair value of the derivative interest swap instruments at december  and does not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company
