for the years ended december   and approximately  and of the company s revenues  respectively  were derived from fixed price contracts 
fixed price contracts as a percentage of total company revenue declined in compared to primarily due to the acquisition in july of oao services  inc  which forms the company s professional services business and which primarily has time and materials contracts 
certain of the company s fixed price contracts require the company to meet certain pre established levels of service  while achieving certain operating or managerial efficiencies during the course of the engagements 
profitability is generally lower during the early term of the engagements as the company invests in assuring a smooth start up and in attaining certain service levels prior to the implementation of productivity improvements 
upon completion of the initial performance phase  the company initiates activities to increase profitability through improved management practices and the establishment of new technical and operational methodologies 
professional services provides information technology personnel primarily on a time and materials basis  that are regularly utilized within engagements to meet short or indefinite term requirements 
there are also instances where an engagement has started on a time and materials basis and evolved to a fixed price basis  as the requirements became sufficiently defined 
professional services are offered as part of the company s service offerings to its strategic customers as well as non strategic customers 
the company s healthcare it solutions practice provides proprietary managed care software application solutions under software license agreements via its mc software 
the products are provided on a one time license fee or a per member per month pmpm long term contractual basis and may include system development  customer service  installation services  training  and ongoing support 
in addition  other services may be provided  such as total project management  hardware planning and implementation  and custom programming 
mc is currently installed at over managed care sites in the united states and the bahamas 
e business consulting solutions are generally provided on a time and materials contractual basis 
the company  through its e business consulting solutions services  provides entire life cycle services for organizations 
these services range from initial business process modeling and development  through system installation and implementation 
the company also provides a full suite of continuous support services to help maintain and upgrade these complex  mission critical systems 
the e business consulting solutions segment is dedicated to implementing and supporting third party designed software applications and systems sold on a licensed and asp basis 
the company focuses its efforts on middle market commercial customers  as well as public sector customers 
in support of these efforts  the company has established strategic relationships with third party software vendors such as siebel systems  ncr  sap  compaq and microsoft 
the company signed a special value added industry remarketer vair agreement with siebel systems  inc this agreement permits oaot to design  install  resell and host  on an asp basis  siebel solutions for commercial and public sector customers in north america and europe 
the company has also hired teams of siebel consultants to implement comprehensive crm solutions 
the company has experienced substantial growth since its inception  with revenues increasing to million in  from million in engagements which involve new services to existing customers or services to new customers may result in lower margins during the early term of the engagement 
the company has historically experienced margin improvements after the start up phase of its engagements 
in addition  operating results can be affected by the level of the company s investments in international and other business development activities 
the company believes that its business is not seasonal 
revenues from two strategic customers were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the largest strategic customer accounted for and  and the second largest strategic customer accounted for and of revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has diversified the type of service provided to its strategic customers and expanded the number of strategic customer business units to whom it provides services 
for the year ended december   oaot earned of its revenues from data center management services provided to strategic customers 
for the year ended december   the company earned of revenues from data center management 
a decrease in the revenues or loss of a strategic customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that either strategic customer will renew existing contracts maturing within the next twelve months or continue to engage the company s services at historical levels  if at all 
the termination or non renewal of a strategic customer s contract by an end user customer could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial conditions 
the company s data center contracts with a strategic customer are up for renewal during the second half of company management believes that oaot offers the best solution and value to its customers for these services 
there can be no assurance that oaot will win all or any portion of these contracts or that all or any portion of these contracts  if renewed  would continue at historical profitability levels 
while the it services industry has generally experienced labor shortages and wage inflation in excess of many other industries  the company s engagements have not been materially affected  primarily due to the company s practice of retaining the majority of the outsourced personnel 
the company prices its services under these engagements on the basis of the historical cost of the outsourced function  managerial experience  and its assessment of evolving technical factors 
the company also enters into professional services engagements requiring high demand it specialists for terms ranging up to months  usually on a time and materials basis 
the company is subject to the same general labor pressures inherent in the it services industry when performing these engagements and as it expands its services into other internet centric and technology infrastructure solution businesses 
the company is dependent upon its ability to attract  hire and retain personnel who possess the technical skills and experience necessary to meet the service requirements of its clients 
in pricing its services under shorter term engagements  the company evaluates the existing labor market for it specialists and the expected duration of the engagement 
the company often places its employees in the workplace of both its strategic and end user customers 
the company is therefore exposed to potential liability with respect to actions taken by its employees  such as damages caused by employee errors  misuse of client proprietary information  or theft of client property 
due to the nature of the company s potential liability with respect to any such actions  there can be no assurance that any insurance maintained by the company will be adequate to cover any such liability
