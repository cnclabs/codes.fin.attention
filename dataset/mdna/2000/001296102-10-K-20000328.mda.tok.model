although the terms of ahl s contracts vary significantly  ahl s aviation services and facility services businesses generally agree to provide a stated service level and clients generally agree to pay ahl an hourly rate for services provided 
certain of ahl s clients  especially in the cargo services area  are billed a fixed dollar amount per month for services performed 
under some contracts  ahl is entitled to rate increases when there are increases in the federal minimum wage  notwithstanding that most of ahl s employees are paid at rates in excess of the federal minimum wage 
in the marketing support services business  ahl generally enters into three year contracts with its clients  pursuant to which it agrees to provide services for a fixed number of programs per year 
the scope and magnitude of the programs are determined by the client 
most contracts have multi year terms and they are generally terminable by either party upon to days written notice 
most of the contracts entered into by ahl have been renewed or extended upon the expiration of their original terms 
ahl has experienced an average annual retention rate of over of its contracts over the last three fiscal years  excluding the united kingdom transportation operations sold during sales and marketing ahl targets large corporations and institutions that have significant contract staffing and outsourcing needs  marketing its services to potential clients through senior management  regional and district managers and a local sales force 
as part of its operating philosophy  ahl emphasizes building and maintaining relationships with personnel at various levels of its clients organizations  including relationships with both senior executives and local operating personnel 
ahl is developing a national sales and marketing strategy  under which ahl will focus on cross selling its services to its primarily fortune clients 
furthermore  ahl has designated certain senior managers as responsible for specific national account relationships and is in the process of adding national account sales representatives 
workforce management ahl s core competency includes recruiting  hiring  training  motivating and managing the large numbers of personnel required to provide many of the support services needed by its clients 
ahl s district managers and their human resources staff have ongoing responsibility for hiring  recruiting and training ahl s local workforce 
recruiting 
ahl has developed innovative recruiting methods that have been particularly effective in reaching targeted pools of prospective employees  in addition to utilizing traditional recruiting methods such as job fairs  trade journals  local advertising  and interviewing at vocational schools 
after analyzing the demographics of each market  ahl seeks to establish relationships with community groups and leaders 
for example  in a number of markets  ahl has found that senior citizens are an excellent source of potential employees for its pre departure screening services and recruiters frequently visit senior citizen centers 
ahl leverages these community relationships to provide a feeder into its employment pool and believes that current employees serve as effective recruiters for it 
ahl believes these methods are more effective than more traditional recruiting methods 
hiring 
within the united states  every employee hired by ahl must complete a written application and provide proof of citizenship or resident alien status 
further  most employees are subject to a year employment and criminal background check 
unlike many of its competitors  ahl requires mandatory pre employment drug testing for all aviation services and facility services employees 
in europe  ahl screens potential applicants through a telephone interview  and each potential employee must complete a written application and undergo an examination that includes vision  hearing and psychological testing 
an initial one year background check is required for every new employee 
each european employee is hired subject to a three month probationary period and continuity of employment is subject to a year background check 
where legally permitted  employees in certain european countries are also subject to random drug testing

ahl is the only organization approved by the united kingdom department of transport the united kingdom dot to provide aviation security training to personnel of the united kingdom dot  the agency that regulates aviation security matters in the united kingdom 
retention 
ahl believes that employee retention is critical to lowering operating costs and providing high quality service to its clients 
accordingly  ahl places significant emphasis on programs to motivate its employees and reduce employee turnover 
since inception  ahl has been able to provide quality service and expand its business despite the high employee turnover that is inherent in low wage  task repetitive positions 
ahl s club recognizes employees for superior attendance  attitude  appearance and performance 
members receive quarterly bonuses and other rewards  and are recognized throughout ahl 
ahl believes its historical retention rates are significantly higher than industry averages 
field management 
ahl has developed a management structure under which significant workforce decisions are made at the local level  thereby requiring field managers to assume responsibility for recruiting  hiring and retention 
ahl s bonus system for regional and district managers is based upon achievement of specific performance objectives  including revenue  profitability  new business and client retention 
regional and district managers can earn bonuses of up to of their base compensation by achieving all their objectives established annually by ahl 
ahl has a stock option plan for key corporate and field management employees 
employees 
as of december   ahl had  employees 
approximately  of its employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
each of these agreements was assumed by ahl in connection with an acquisition or an outsourcing contract previously held by another vendor 
ahl considers its relations with its employees to be good 
there currently is an effort by a union to organize of ahl s aviation services employees at los angeles international airport 
the outcome of this effort is not known  but is not expected to have a material impact on operations 
management information systems ahl s management information systems contribute significantly to its daily operations  financial performance and customer service 
ahl has invested  and will continue to invest  resources in the development of systems to grow and support the business needs of its clients

in operational support services  ahl acquired several integrated scheduling and accounting systems through its acquisitions 
in marketing support services  ahl uses technology extensively 
the state of the art marketing and sales support applications and related infrastructure provide the business with order entry and inventory control automation  organized distribution facilities  efficient out bound logistics  and valuable management database and reporting systems 
across all its business lines  ahl has utilized technology to simplify  automate and integrate the administrative and management reporting processes that serve its business units 
competition the contract staffing and outsourcing industry is extremely competitive and highly fragmented  with limited barriers to entry 
companies within the contract staffing and outsourcing industry compete on the basis of the quality of service provided  their ability to provide national and international services  the range of services offered  and price 
ahl believes its competitive advantages include its reputation for providing high quality service and its ability to serve large clients in the united states and europe 
most of ahl s competitors offer a more limited range of services and focus on a few specific industries 
ahl competes in international  national  regional and local markets with outsourcing companies  specialized contract service providers and in house organizations that provide services to potential clients and third parties 
ahl s principal national competitors include aviation services icts international nv and international total services  inc  facility services burns international services corporation and the wackenhut corporation  operational support services manpower  inc  kelly services  inc 
and adecco sa  and marketing support services young america corporation  startek  inc  psfweb  inc  clientlogic corporation and damark international  inc ahl also competes with numerous local and regional companies as well as divisions of several major staffing companies 
certain of ahl s competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial resources and larger operations than ahl 
government regulation current regulations relating to aviation security 
ahl s business  particularly its aviation services line of business  is significantly affected by government regulation 
the aviation security services provided by ahl are subject to extensive regulation by the faa in the united states and comparable regulatory authorities in europe 
aviation security in the united states is subject to regulations and directives issued by the faa and to legislation enacted by the united states congress 
under current regulations  responsibility for aviation security is shared between the faa and various other federal  state and local agencies and industry participants which include air carriers and airport authorities as well as independent contractors that perform services for or on behalf of these industry participants 
the faa conducts threat and vulnerability assessments and  through its regulatory authority  directs the aviation industry to implement measures that address existing and anticipated threat situations 
the faa also tests security measures at airports to assess vulnerabilities in current airport security systems 
any change in the faa s directives relating to aviation security could affect ahl s operations in the aviation services business 
under faa regulations  which the faa has proposed to revise through rulemaking proceedings  each air carrier and airport authority must adopt and carry out an faa approved security program that provides for the safety of persons and property traveling in air transportation against acts of criminal violence and aircraft piracy 
air carriers are responsible for providing security measures for all people and items connected with their aircraft  including passengers  baggage  and maintenance and flight crews 
airport authorities are responsible for maintaining a secure environment on airport grounds and for providing law enforcement support and training 
each security program adopted by an airline must include the screening of passengers and their carry on baggage  and other persons having access to controlled areas  to prevent the carriage aboard aircraft of weapons or explosive devices  controlling access to aircraft  checked baggage and cargo  appropriate controls on shipping of cargo  and security inspection of any aircraft left unattended 
airlines may utilize either their own employees or third party contractors to carry out their security programs 
screeners operating x ray systems must receive initial and recurrent training in the detection of weapons and other dangerous articles 
certain of these requirements are currently the subject of an faa rulemaking proceeding  which has been delayed until more data becomes available  and may be modified upon adoption of final rules 
current faa regulations require pre departure screeners and their supervisors to undergo a year criminal and employment background check and a five year employment verification  and a fingerprint based criminal record background check if warranted  with the employer required to maintain records of these investigations throughout the term of employment 
airport operations and air carriers are required to audit employment history investigations 
ahl believes that it complies with these standards 
from time to time  the faa issues directives requiring the implementation of specific actions by air carriers and airport authorities 
for example  following the destruction of twa flight in july  the faa began to require additional passenger profiling for specified types of flights  matching of passengers and checked baggage  additional searching of aircraft cabins and cargo areas  additional physical searches of carry on items and other enhanced security measures 
ahl s business can be negatively or positively affected by any such directives 
generally  european standards for aviation security are more stringent than those currently in effect in the united states 
passengers are subject to more comprehensive profiling and review of documents  parked aircraft must be guarded  searched and cleaned in accordance with applicable regulations  passenger baggage is subject to match procedures as well as random x ray and hand searches  commercial cargo is guarded and subject to random x ray searches  and airline employees and other crews are subject to additional security measures 
the faa requires that us airlines utilize similar passenger profiling programs in their european operations 
ahl is subject to random periodic testing by the faa with regard to adherence to regulations relating to pre departure screening and passenger profiling  hiring practices including background checks  drug testing  training and individual employee file maintenance and baggage handling 
in the united kingdom  the uk dot also conducts testing relating to passenger and baggage handling  aircraft security  document verification and employee background checks 
any failure to meet these performance standards or to pass these tests may result in the loss of a contract or ahl s license to perform services  either of which is likely to have a material adverse effect on ahl s reputation  business  results of operations and financial condition 
recent developments relating to aviation security 
several initiatives by united states governmental authorities and industry participants have resulted in recommended changes in regulatory requirements relating to aviation security 
these initiatives have been undertaken by the united states congress  through provisions of the federal aviation reauthorization act of the act  the white house commission on aviation safety and security the gore commission  which published its final report in february  and the aviation security advisory committee asac  a committee of government  industry  and consumer advocacy representatives that issued its recommendations in december each of these groups has considered issues that have ranged from the fundamental structure of  and sharing of responsibilities relating to  aviation security to specific near term measures that could be implemented to improve aviation security 
the gore commission included the heads of various federal agencies and was charged with making recommendations as to how the partnership between the us government and industry participants can achieve improved aviation security 
the gore commission issued its final report in february and included among its recommendations development of uniform performance standards for the selection  training and certification of pre departure screening companies  implementation of procedures for matching of passengers and checked baggage on a nationwide basis  the continued development and implementation of an automated passenger profiling system  and utilization of us customs service personnel and computer systems to complement the efforts of the faa and other federal agencies 
the act required that the faa conduct a study and report to congress on whether to transfer certain responsibilities of air carriers to either airport authorities or to the federal government or whether to provide for some other sharing of current responsibilities 
this report has not yet been issued by the faa 
however  ahl believes that the faa is likely to follow the final recommendation released by the gore commission  as described above 
the act directed the faa to certify companies that provide pre departure screening  continue to assist air carriers in developing computer assisted passenger profiling programs  assess programs for matching of passengers and checked baggage that are currently being utilized in the industry on a test basis  and report on changes to enhance and supplement the screening and inspection of cargo and mail shipments 
on january   the faa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing the certification of pre departure screening companies  one of the recommendations of the gore commission 
the proposed rule would require faa certification for companies the airlines hire to perform security screening at airports to meet enhanced requirements 
it would establish uniform standards for security screening company performance  strengthen training and testing standards for screeners  and impose more stringent experience and training requirements on screening company managers and instructors 
the proposed rule would make screening companies accountable  along with air carriers  for screener performance and screener training 
as discussed in the proposed rule  the faa is currently developing and deploying threat image projection and computer based training 
threat image projection is an automated screener testing system that is installed onto existing x ray machines and is used to project artificial threat images onto x ray screens 
screeners ability to detect these images is then used to evaluate individual performance and identify areas for additional training 
it also gives the faa objective data needed to achieve compliance with certification standards 
the threat image projection system is a component of the screener proficiency evaluation and reporting system  a system that the faa has been working with airlines to deploy  which aims to improve the training and monitoring of skills of screeners through computer based training aids 
the proposed rule would require that screening companies adopt and implement faa approved screening company security programs that would include threat image projection standards 
the proposed rule also notes that the faa anticipates making computer based training available for use  but does not anticipate requiring its use at this time 
the comment period for the proposed rule ends april  the proposed rule does not identify a target date for implementing the new program 
regarding implementation of bag match and automated profiling systems  the faa has developed an automated passenger profiling system referred to as computer assisted passenger screening caps 
both caps and manual passenger screening systems are being used in the passenger bag match system  to select passengers luggage which will either be examined by explosives detection systems or will not be allowed to be transported unless a passenger is on the flight 
on january   several air carriers voluntarily implemented caps  and most other carriers have since opted to implement it as well 
on april   the faa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require additional security checks to the checked baggage of certain passengers on domestic flights carrying over people 
the proposed rule encourages the use of the caps system to select passengers whose checked luggage would be subject to additional security screenings 
the proposed rule also permits alternatives  such as checking all baggage or matching each piece of checked luggage to its owner on a particular flight 
the comment period for the proposed rule was extended to august  no final rule has been adopted 
ahl cannot accurately predict the outcome of these or any future aviation security initiatives 
however  any such initiatives could have a positive or an adverse effect on ahl 
other applicable regulations 
in many european airports in which ahl operates  a license is required from the airport authority in order to perform services at the airport 
some airport authorities limit the number of licenses they issue 
ahl is also required to maintain various licenses and permits from state and local government authorities in order to provide commercial security  shuttle bus and certain other services 
risk management and safety because ahl s business is labor intensive  workers compensation is a significant operating expense for ahl in the united states 
in addition  ahl is exposed to possible claims by its clients customers or employees  alleging discrimination or harassment by ahl s employees 
ahl is also exposed to liability for the acts or negligence of its employees who cause personal injury or damage while on assignment  as well as claims of misuse of client proprietary information or theft of client property 
ahl has adopted policies and procedures intended to reduce its exposure to these risks 
ahl maintains insurance against these risks with policy limits it considers sufficient  subject to self insurance of  per incident and an aggregate stop loss 
in addition  ahl maintains aviation liability insurance of million per incident 
ahl establishes reserves in its financial statements for the estimated costs of pending claims as well as the estimated costs of incurred but not yet reported claims 
the reserve for these unreported claims is based on prior experience 
ahl s reserves are periodically revised  as necessary  based on developments related to pending claims 
ahl s reserve for workers compensation and automobile claims was million as of december  ahl s risk management specialists  with the assistance of ahl s regional managers  are responsible for claims management and the establishment of appropriate reserves for the portion of claims not covered by insurance

ahl believes that certain employees  who have since been terminated  may have violated faa regulations  as well as company policies and procedures in these matters 
the faa has reviewed other major airport locations of argenbright security and has not identified any similar situations 
ahl has been informed that the matters being investigated are limited to the operations of the philadelphia office  and ahl does not believe that the matters under review represent a systemic problem 
since learning of the issues  ahl has taken the necessary actions to ensure compliance with all faa regulations and company policies and procedures in philadelphia 
additionally  management has reviewed this investigation with the major clients of its philadelphia operations and ahl does not believe that this investigation has had any adverse affect on its relationship with these clients 
ahl is cooperating with the us attorneys office in this investigation and believes this investigation will be concluded in the first six months of ahl is involved in various routine litigation  disputes and claims in the ordinary course of business  primarily employee and customer contract issues

ahl s capital expenditures over the next several years  as a percentage of its revenues  are expected to be generally consistent with those of the most recent fiscal year 
in connection with certain acquisitions  ahl has agreed to pay additional consideration based on operating results of the acquired entity 
the payment of any such earnouts could result in an increase in the purchase prices for such acquisitions and  as a result  additional goodwill

if ahl were to make a significant acquisition for cash  it may be necessary for ahl to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
forward looking statements certain statements made in this report  and other written or oral statements made by or on behalf of ahl  may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
when used in this report  the words believes  expects  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
statements regarding future events and developments and ahl s future performance  as well as its expectations  beliefs  plans  estimates or projections relating to the future  are forward looking statements within the meaning of these laws 
examples of such statements in this report include descriptions of its plans with respect to developing the four business lines  its plans to continue to change its business mix  expectations relating to future acquisitions and its continuing growth 
all forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events to differ materially from those projected 
management believes that these forward looking statements are reasonable  however  you should not place undue reliance on such statements 
these statements are based on current expectations and speak only as of the date of such statements 
ahl undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of future events  new information or otherwise 
the following are some of the factors that could cause ahl s actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in ahl s forward looking statements ahl s historical reliance on certain major clients and the aviation industry  and the consolidation  financial difficulties  and cyclicality of the airline industry  ahl s ability to manage a business that has been growing both internally and through acquisitions  and management s ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates  finance or complete acquisitions on favorable terms and integrate acquired businesses  the high rates of personnel turnover and periodic shortages of personnel that affect the contract staffing and outsourcing industry 
ahl may be required to increase the wages that it pays and the benefits that it provides in order to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  the exposure of ahl s international operations to special risks  including trade barriers  risks of increases in duties  taxes and governmental royalties  social and severance costs  exchange controls  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  national and regional labor strikes  political risks and risks of the new single european currency  the impact of competition  including competition for labor and in other important aspects of ahl s business 
ahl s primary competitors include outsourcing companies  specialized contract service providers and in house organizations that provide services to potential clients and third parties 
ahl s business is extremely competitive and highly fragmented  the unfavorable outcome of any possible pending litigation  disputes or claims against ahl  ahl s exposure to increasing unemployment insurance premiums and workers compensation costs  and general economic conditions which affect the overall level of economic activity  outsourcing and the availability of labor 
inflation ahl does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that ahl s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
year issues ahl previously recognized the material nature of the business issues surrounding computer processing of dates into and beyond the year and began taking corrective action 
ahl s efforts included replacing and testing three basic aspects of its business operations internal information technology it systems  including sales order processing  contract management  financial systems and service management  internal non it systems  including office and other equipment products  and material third party relationships 
management believes ahl has completed all of the activities within its control to ensure that ahl s systems are year compliant and ahl has experienced no interruptions to normal operations due to the start of the year ahl s year readiness capital costs were approximately million 
ahl funded these costs through its credit facility and such costs were generally not incremental to existing it budgets  internal resources were re deployed and timetables for implementation of replacement systems were accelerated 
ahl does not currently expect to apply any further funds to address year issues 
as of march   ahl has not experienced any material disruptions of its internal computer systems or software applications  and has not experienced any problems with the computer systems or software applications of its third party vendors  suppliers or service providers 
ahl will continue to monitor these third parties to determine the impact  if any  on the business of ahl and the actions ahl must take  if any  in the event of non compliance by any of these third parties 
based upon ahl s assessment of compliance by third parties  there appears to be no material business risk posed by any such noncompliance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
a substantial amount of ahl s revenues are received  and operating costs are incurred  in foreign currencies primarily the british pound and the german deutsche mark  with a significant amount of operating income being derived from operations in the united kingdom and germany 
the denomination of foreign subsidiaries account balances in their local currency exposes ahl to certain foreign exchange rate risks 
ahl addresses the exposure by financing most working capital needs in the applicable foreign currencies 
ahl does not engage in hedging transactions to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on ahl has been insignificant 
interest rate risk 
ahl maintains a credit facility  two interest rate swap agreements and other long term debt which subjects ahl to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
ahl s five year credit facility had a balance outstanding at december  of million  which was at a variable rate of interest 
in order to hedge against increasing interest rates  effective october   ahl entered into a four year interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of approximately million to offset a portion of the floating interest rate risk 
on may   this swap agreement was replaced with a three year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of approximately million 
on january   ahl entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of approximately million which terminates on may  the fair value of the million swap agreement at december  approximates million 
thus  if ahl were to unwind the swap agreement  ahl would recognize a cash gain of approximately  at december  a change in the prevailing interest rates of would result in a change in the total fair value of long term debt of approximately million 
fair values were determined from discounted cash flows
