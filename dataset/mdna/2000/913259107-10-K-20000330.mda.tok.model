item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the year in review the year presented both challenges and opportunities for unitil corporation unitil or the company 
we developed an aggressive plan to grow our company and made necessary expenditures for the successful start up of new ventures 
we continued to focus on managing the restructuring of our core utility business in a way that ensures fairness in the treatment of the company s assets and obligations and  at the same time  provides choice for customers 
our massachusetts subsidiary  fitchburg gas and electric light company fg e  successfully completed the divestiture of its electric generation and power supply portfolio  complied with legislatively mandated rate discounts for all customers  and provided systems and information for customers to choose their electric energy supplier 
fg e also began the transition out of the gas merchant function for gas supply under a multi year phase in of a restructured natural gas industry that will provide customers the opportunity to choose their gas supplier 
our new hampshire electric utility operating subsidiaries  concord electric company ceco and exeter hampton electric company e h  continue to prepare for the transition to a deregulated market structure  pending resolution on key restructuring policies and issues that have slowed the restructuring process in the state 
the weather played an important role during the year  as another unusually warm winter negatively impacted gas sales used for heating 
by contrast  the hot summer weather in new england produced record demand for electricity and helped increase electricity sales for the year 
apart from these seasonal weather factors  the underlying economic growth within our utility service territories remains strong 
one of our major customers filed for chapter bankruptcy in june the customer is currently looking for a buyer  with the goal of resuming operations in we continue to work closely with the customer  providing electric and gas service  and are working out payment terms on a current basis 
during  the company continued its work to ensure that the arrival of the new millennium did not impact service to its customers 
we assessed  remediated and tested all our mission critical systems  worked in collaboration with government  industry and business allies  and achieved our goal of being yk compliant by mid year 
unitil experienced no problems  malfunctions or interruption of service resulting from yk effects on any critical systems 
moving forward into the year  we do not anticipate any problems or interruptions to normal business operations as a result of yk 
usourcetm during unitil acquired a minority interest in enermetrix 
com formerly known as north american power brokers  inc through the purchase of million of convertible preferred stock and  of common stock warrants 
enermetrix 
com is a privately held company which has been financed by several rounds of venture capital 
unitil has participated in two of these rounds of financing 
enermetrix 
com is a developer of an internet based energy procurement bid system the enermetrix 
com exchange or the exchange that matches buyers and sellers of energy in competitive markets 
unitil s ownership represents a equity interest in enermetrix 
com and unitil is represented on enermetrix 
com s board of directors 
although the market value of the investment in enermetrix 
com stock is not readily determinable  management believes the fair value of this investment currently exceeds its carrying cost 
in addition  unitil resources  inc uri  a non regulated subsidiary of unitil  licensed enermetrix 
com s innovative internet based technology for brokering electricity and natural gas sales between consumers and suppliers 
under the name usourcetm  we offer retail energy consumers the market benefits of energy supply bidding with the efficiency and cost benefits of e commerce 
customers  with the assistance of our usourcetm sales force and back office support  post their electric and gas requirements on the exchange through the usourcetm website 
customers realize significant time and dollar savings using the exchange  eliminating costly and time consuming rfp s request for proposals and assuring highly competitive  time sensitive bids 
suppliers use the exchange as a low cost  efficient customer acquisition vehicle  and are able to adjust their bids in real time in response to rapidly changing market conditions 
in january  uri signed an agreement with a major software development vendor to further automate the usourcetm product line for mid market business to business e commerce 
the usourcetm website and automated customer enrollment process will facilitate consumer access to the exchange and ultimately to energy suppliers 
this enhanced product development effort is designed to meet the needs and requirements of the mid market business customer segment and increase the total market for usourcetm products and services 
usourcetm continues to attract new customers and has expanded service throughout new york and new england 
uri has entered into a product partnership with a metering and data collection company in order to offer a broader line of products in addition to brokering services 
unitil plans to deploy additional capital and resources to usourcetm to expand our customer base and to more fully automate the on line energy procurement process 
earnings and dividends net income applicable to common stock for was million  above net income 
contributing positively to the company s earnings performance were higher electric and gas distribution revenues and the contribution of revenues from usourcetm 
also contibuting to earnings were lower property and other taxes compared to the prior year 
offsetting these positive contributors were higher depreciation and amortization expenses due to a higher level of plant in service and the accelerated write off of electric generating assets under our restructuring plan in massachusetts 
diluted earnings per average common share were for the year ended december   compared to and for and  respectively 
the average return on common equity was   and in   and  respectively

this annual dividend of in resulted in a payout ratio of 
at its january meeting  the unitil board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on the company s common stock of per share 
this quarterly dividend maintains the annual dividend rate at per share  as the company balances growth initiatives and income objectives 
operating revenues electric unit kwh sales unitil s total electric kilowatt hour kwh sales increased by in compared to  primarily due to system growth and a warmer summer season 
in our utility service territories  cooling degree days were well above normal during the summer cooling season 
sales to residential customers increased by in compared to  and were higher than sales 
these energy sales increases were due to warmer summer weather and a increase in the number of residential customers that we serve 
commercial and industrial sales of electricity were up in  due to a continued strong regional economy 
sales were higher by compared to  reflecting the fact that a major customer had suspended operations in  but resumed operations for a portion of the following table details total kilowatt hour sales for the last three years by major customer class kwh sales s residential    commercial industrial    total kwh sales    electric operating revenue increased by million  or  in compared to approximately one third of this increase was the result of higher sales volume across all customer classes  slightly offset by lower electric rates  due to additional rate discounts mandated in massachusetts and lower energy supply prices in new hampshire 
the remainder of this increase was the result of the resale of energy supply  due to the electric utility industry restructuring process 
the energy component of electric operating revenue represents the recovery of energy supply costs which are collected from customers through periodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms 
changes in energy supply prices do not affect net income  as they normally mirror corresponding changes in energy supply costs 
electric operating revenue s residential    commercial industrial    total operating revenue    operating revenues gas unit therm sales total firm therm gas sales increased in when compared to the decrease in sales is attributable to a increase in sales to commercial industrial customers  offset by a decrease in sales to residential customers  due to the warm winter weather 
total firm therm sales decreased in the two year period from to  as the winter heating season in was warmer than in the following table details total firm therm gas sales for the last three years  by major customer class firm therm sales s residential    commercial industrial    total firm therm sales    gas operating revenues  which represent approximately of unitil s total operating revenues  increased by million  or  in compared to this increase was attributable to an approximate base rate increase that went into effect in december gas operating revenue s residential    commercial industrial    total firm gas revenue    interruptible gas revenue    total gas revenues    operating revenues other other revenue increased from  in to  in this increase was the result of revenue generated from consulting activities of  and the company s internet based energy brokering business  usourcetm of  usourcetm began operations in may of operating expenses fuel and purchased power expense is the cost of power supply  including fuel used in electric generation and the price of wholesale energy and capacity  that meets unitil s electric energy requirements 
fuel and purchased power expenses normally recoverable from customers through periodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms increased million  or in compared to the change was driven by an increase in the company s total energy requirements in  offset by a decrease in wholesale power prices 
an additional component of this increase was the purchase of excess energy supply  due to electric utility industry restructuring and the timing of the divestiture of fg e s power supply portfolio 
the company anticipates that power supply related costs and corresponding revenues will decline in future years  as customers choose alternate competitive energy suppliers under a restructured electric utility industry 
gas purchased for resale reflects gas purchased and manufactured to supply the company s total gas energy requirements 
gas supply costs are recoverable from customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
purchased gas costs remained level in compared to  reflecting a decrease in therms purchased  offset by slightly higher wholesale gas prices in gas purchased for resale decreased by million  or in the two year period from to  driven by a decrease in therms purchased due to warmer winter weather 
under order  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allowed gas pipeline suppliers to recover prudently incurred costs resulting from the transition into a deregulated environment 
through the end of  the amount of transition costs incurred by the company totaled approximately million 
these costs were recovered directly from gas customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
the company did not incur any additional transition costs in and is not expected to incur these costs in the future 
operation and maintenance expense  which includes distribution utility operating costs  conservation and load management c lm program expenditures  and the company s share of operating costs related to power production at the generation facilities in which the company has a partial ownership interest  increased by approximately million  or in compared to the increase in operation and maintenance expenses compared to last year reflects million increase in costs associated with c lm programs  as well as approximately million in costs to launch usourcetm 
the c lm expenses are offset by revenues accrued to be collected in the future from customers through rate recovery mechanisms 
in  operation and maintenance expense increased from by approximately million  or  due to higher administrative costs related to electric utility industry restructuring 
depreciation  amortization and taxes depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  for over the prior year  due to a higher level of plant in service  higher gas plant depreciation rates and the accelerated write off of electric generating assets  due to electric utility industry restructuring in massachusetts 
the electric generating assets will be fully amortized in approximately years 
federal and state income taxes increased by million in compared to this result reflects higher net income before taxes  as well as a higher effective income tax rate in  partially due to the lower level of investment tax credit amortization 
local property and other taxes decreased million  or  in this decrease was related to the divestiture of generating assets and the impact of state and local property tax changes in new hampshire 
non operating income expenses non operating expenses  net in were lower than in  reflecting a higher level of non operating income related to non utility products and services 
interest expense interest expense  net remained level in compared to the prior year 
an increase in accrued interest income associated with deferred rate recovery mechanisms and lower short term borrowing rates were offset by interest expense on a higher level of debt outstanding 
the million decrease in interest expense in from was due to an increase in accrued interest income related to deferred rate recovery mechanisms and interest on refunds received from suppliers 
capital requirements and liquidity unitil requires capital for the acquisition of property  plant  and equipment in order to improve  protect  maintain and expand its electric and gas distribution systems  to improve customer service operations and capabilities  and to pursue new growth opportunities 
the capital necessary to meet these requirements has been derived primarily from the company s retained earnings and through the sale of shares of common stock through the company s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans 
when internally generated funds are not available  it is the company s policy to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the capital requirements of its subsidiaries and  when necessary  to repay short term debt through the issuance of permanent financing 
cash flows from operating activities increased by million in  after decreasing by million in the increase in compared to was due to lower working capital needs at the year end balance sheet date as a result of timing differences of payments on energy supply contracts 
this favorable cash flow variance was offset by higher levels of accrued revenues  due to rate discounts associated with electric utility industry restructuring in massachusetts 
other contributors to the increase in cash flow were a lower level of materials and supplies inventory  an increase in customer deposits  increased interest payable  and a decrease in net regulatory assets 
offsetting these contributors were a smaller increase in deferred tax provisions from the prior year and a higher level of taxes refundable 
cash flow from operating activities is expected to be negatively impacted in the foreseeable future  as a result of electric utility industry restructuring in massachusetts 
as a result of legislatively mandated retail rate caps  the company is deferring the recovery of certain costs related to the restructuring of its utility business 
these costs are currently being funded from internally generated cash 
the company is exploring various financing alternatives to fund projected deferral levels in future years 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to higher working capital needs at the year end balance sheet date  as a result of timing differences of payments on energy supply contracts  as well as increased refunds of customer deposits 
operating activities s cash provided by operating activities    cash flows used in investing activities increased approximately million in higher spending for utility distribution system additions and improvements million plus the company s investment in enermetrix 
com million were offset by cash received from the sale of the company s interest in new haven harbor station million 
the increase of million in compared to reflected higher spending for utility customer and distribution system additions and improvements 
capital expenditures are projected to increase in to approximately million  primarily reflecting a major distribution substation addition and distribution system improvements 
investing activities s cash used in investing activities    cash flows from financing activities decreased by million in compared to this decrease reflects lower borrowings in versus on january   fg e sold  of long term notes at par to institutional investors  bearing an interest rate of

the change in cash from financing activities from to reflects an increase in both short term and long term borrowings 
financing activities s cash from financing activities    regulatory matters restructuring activity electric and gas industry restructuring and the process for separating the competitive retail sale of the electric and gas energy from the regulated delivery of that energy over a utility s transmission and distribution system has been the predominant focus of the company s regulatory initiatives and activities in both massachusetts and new hampshire 
since march  all electric consumers in massachusetts served by investor owned utilities have had the ability to choose their electric energy supplier 
fg e  the company s massachusetts utility operating subsidiary  began implementation of its comprehensive electric restructuring plan that includes the divestiture of its entire regulated power supply business 
in new hampshire  ceco and e h  our electric utility operating subsidiaries  and unitil power corp  our wholesale power company  continue to prepare for the the transition that will move them into this new market structure pending resolution of key restructuring policies and issues that have slowed the restructing process in the state 
massachusetts gas industry restructuring plans continue to be a major focus of our regulatory activities as well 
since  fg e has worked in collaboration with the other massachusetts local distribution companies ldcs and various other stakeholders to develop and implement the infrastructure to offer gas customers choice of their competitive gas energy supplier and to complete the restructuring of gas service provided by ldcs 
fg e is required to file with the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy mdte new gas tariffs to implement natural gas unbundling in accordance with model terms and conditions resulting from these collaborative efforts 
the target date for implementation of approved tariffs and final rules is april  massachusetts electric on january   the mdte approved fg e s restructuring plan with certain modifications 
the plan provides customers with a the ability to choose an energy supplier  b an option to purchase standard offer service provided by fg e at regulated rates for up to seven years  and c a cumulative rate reduction 
the order also approved fg e s power supply divestiture plan for its interest in three generating units and four long term power supply contracts 
the company has been afforded full recovery of any transition costs through a non bypassable retail transition charge 
pursuant to the plan  on october   fg e filed a proposed contract with constellation power services inc for provision of standard offer service 
service under the fg e constellation contract commenced on march   and is scheduled to continue through february  this contract is the result of the first successful standard offer auction conducted in massachusetts 
a contract for the sale of fg e s interest in the new haven harbor plant was approved by the mdte on march  and the sale of the unit closed on april  a contract for the sale of the entire output from fg e s remaining generating assets and purchased power contracts was approved by the mdte on december   and went into effect february  fg e filed an electric rate decrease effective september   as provided for by the massachusetts electric restructuring act the act 
the act mandated a rate reduction in march  to be followed by an additional  inflation adjusted rate reduction by september  the net rate decrease of reflects fg e s divestiture of its generation assets and purchased power portfolio 
on december   fg e filed with the mdte new rates for effect january  the revised rates maintain the required inflation adjusted rate discount 
the mdte approved the rates on january   subject to reconciliation pursuant to an investigation  resulting in an upward inflation adjustment of relative to september rates 
the mdte has issued a notice of public hearing and procedural conference to examine electric restructuring issues including  but not limited to  consistency of the proposed charges and adjustments with the methods approved in fg e s restructuring plan 
as a result of restructuring and divestiture of fg e s generation and purchased power portfolio  fg e has accelerated the write off of its electric generation assets and on fg e s abandoned investment in seabrook station 
an mdte order established the return to be earned on the unamortized balance of fg e s generation plant 
the new return reduces fg e s earnings on its generation assets 
as this portfolio is amortized over the next years  earnings from this segment of fg e s utility business will continue to decline and ultimately cease 
currently  unitil s earnings from this business segment represent approximately of total consolidated earnings 
massachusetts gas in mid  the mdte directed all massachusetts natural gas ldcs to form a collaborative with other stakeholders to develop common principles and appropriate regulations for the unbundling of gas service  and directed fg e and four other ldcs to file unbundled gas rates for its review 
fg e s unbundled gas rates were filed with  and approved by  the mdte and implemented in november on february   the mdte issued an order in which it determined that the ldcs would continue to have an obligation to provide gas supply and delivery services for another five years  with a review after three years 
this order also set forth the mdte s decision regarding release by ldcs of their pipeline capacity contracts to competitive marketers 
in march  the ldcs and other stakeholders filed a settlement with the mdte which set forth rules for implementing an interim firm transportation service through october  the interim service will ultimately be superseded by the permanent transportation service  expected to begin april  the mdte approved the settlement on april  fg e has made separate compliance filings that were approved by the mdte to implement its interim firm gas transportation service for its largest general service customers effective june  and to complement this service with a firm gas peaking service 
on november  the massachusetts ldcs filed model terms and conditions for gas service  including provisions for capacity assignment  peaking service and default service 
in accordance with the mdte s approval of these model terms and conditions in january  fg e is required to file company specific tariffs that implement natural gas unbundling 
the mdte has also opened a rulemaking proceeding on proposed regulations that would govern the unbundling of services related to the provision of natural gas 
the target date for implementation of approved tariffs and final rules is april  new hampshire on february   the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc issued its final plan for new hampshire electric utilities to transition to a competitive electric market in the state final plan 
the final plan linked the interim recovery of stranded cost by the state s utilities to a comparison of their existing rates with the regional average utility rates 
ceco s and e h s rates are below the regional average  thus  the nhpuc found that ceco and e h were entitled to full interim stranded cost recovery  as defined by the nhpuc 
however  the nhpuc also made certain legal rulings  which could affect ceco s and e h s long term ability to recover all of its stranded costs 
northeast utilities affiliate  public service company of new hampshire  filed suit in us district court for protection from the final plan and related orders and was granted an indefinite stay 
in june  unitil  and other utilities in new hampshire  intervened as plaintiffs in the federal court proceeding 
in june  the federal court clarified that the injunctions issued by the court in had effectively frozen the nhpuc s efforts to implement restructuring 
this amended injunction was challenged by the nhpuc  but affirmed by the first circuit court of appeals in december unitil continues to be a plaintiff intervenor in federal district court and cross motions for summary judgement by all parties are now under review by the court 
during  unitil took steps to settle all of the outstanding issues related to the final plan and the federal court litigation over electric industry restructuring 
in september  unitil reached a settlement with key parties and filed this unopposed agreement with the nhpuc for approval 
however  the nhpuc imposed unacceptable conditions to approval of the settlement  and ceco and e h withdrew the proposed settlement from further nhpuc review 
unitil has continued to work actively to explore additional settlement opportunities and to seek a fair and reasonable resolution of key restructuring policies and issues in new hampshire 
the company is also monitoring the regulatory and legislative proceedings dealing with electric restructuring for other utilities in new hampshire 
rate proceedings the last formal regulatory filings to increase base electric rates for unitil s three retail operating subsidiaries occurred in for ceco  for fg e  and for e h 
a majority of the company s operating revenues are collected under various periodic rate adjustment mechanisms including fuel  purchased power  cost of gas  energy efficiency  and restructuring related cost recovery mechanisms 
industry restructuring will continue to change the methods of how certain costs are recovered through the company s regulated rates and tariffs 
on may   fg e filed a gas base rate case with the mdte 
the last base rate case had been in after evidentiary hearings  the mdte issued an order allowing fg e to establish new rates  effective november   that would produce an annual increase of approximately million in gas revenues 
as part of the proceeding  the massachusetts attorney general alleged that fg e had double collected fuel inventory finance charges  and requested that the mdte require fg e to refund approximately million in double collections since the company believes that the attorney general s claim is without merit and that a refund was not justified or warranted 
the mdte rejected the attorney general s request and stated its intent to open a separate proceeding to investigate the attorney general s claim 
on november   the mdte issued an order of notice initiating an investigation of this matter 
this proceeding is underway and is expected to be concluded in the second quarter of on october   the mdte initiated a proceeding designed to result in the eventual implementation of performance based ratemaking pbr for all electric and gas distribution utilities in massachusetts 
pbr is a method of setting regulated distribution rates that provide incentives for utilities to control costs while maintaining a high level of service quality 
under pbr  a company s earnings are tied to performance targets  and penalties can be imposed for deterioration of service quality 
on december   fg e filed a petition with the mdte for authority to defer for later recovery costs associated with its preparation of a pbr filing for its gas division and its participation in the mdte initiated generic gas and electric pbr proceedings 
this petition is pending 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that pbr would have on the company s ability to continue applying the standards of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
on december   the massachusetts attorney general initiated a complaint against fg e 
the attorney general requested that the mdte launch an investigation of the distribution rates  rate of return  and depreciation accrual rates for fg e s electric operations in calendar year to date  the mdte has taken no action on the attorney general s complaint 
millstone unit no 
fg e has a nonoperating ownership in the millstone unit no 
millstone nuclear generating unit which supplies it with megawatts mw of electric capacity 
in january  the nuclear regulatory commission nrc placed millstone on its watch list  which calls for increased nrc inspection attention 
in march  as a result of engineering evaluations  millstone was taken out of service 
the nrc authorized the restart of millstone in june during the period that millstone was out of service  fg e continued to incur its proportionate share of the unit s ongoing operations and maintenance o m costs  and may incur additional o m costs and capital expenditures to meet nrc requirements 
fg e also incurred costs to replace the power that was expected to be generated by the unit 
during the outage  fg e incurred approximately million in replacement power costs  and recovered those costs through its electric fuel charge  which is subject to review and reconciliation by the mdte 
under existing mdte precendent  fg e s replacement power costs of million could be subject to disallowance in rates 
in august  fg e  in concert with other non operating joint owners  filed a demand for arbitration in connecticut and a lawsuit in massachusetts  in an effort to recover costs associated with the extended unplanned shutdown 
several preliminary rulings have been issued in the arbitration and legal cases  and both cases are continuing 
on march   fg e entered into a settlement agreement with the defendants under which fg e will dismiss its lawsuit and arbitration claims 
the settlement is generally similar to earlier settlements with the defendants and three joint owners that own  in the aggregate  approximately percent of the unit 
the settlement provides for fg e to receive an initial payment of  and other amounts contingent upon future events and would result in fg e s entire interest in the unit being included in the auction of the majority interest  and certain of the minority interests  in millstone expected to be completed by upon completion of the sale of millstone  fg e will be relieved of all residual liabilities  including decommissioning liabilities  associated with millstone fg e expects to flow the net proceeds of the settlement to its customers 
environmental matters in october  fg e applied for a time extension on the tier b permit which allows fg e to work towards temporary remediation of the site for fg e s former manufactured gas plant site mgp at sawyer passway 
the permit extension application was made to accommodate delays in the scheduled construction of the new highway bridge that is to be built across sawyer passway and to permit fulfillment of fg e s obligations associated with the bridge construction as stipulated in a memorandum of understanding with the massachusetts highway department and the massachusetts department of environmental protection 
in december  the massachusetts department of environmental protection granted fg e a two year extension to the fg e s current tier b permit at sawyer passway 
upon completion of site remediation associated with the bridge construction  the last remaining portion of the sawyer passway mgp site is expected to be closed out and attain the status of temporary closure in late this temporary closure allows fg e to monitor the site every five years to determine if a more feasible remediation alternative can be developed and achieved 
the costs of remedial action at this site are initially funded from traditional sources of capital and recovered from customers under a rate recovery mechanism approved by the mdte 
the company also has a number of liability insurance policies that may provide coverage for environmental remediation at this site 
market risk although unitil s utility operating companies are subject to commodity price risk as part of their traditional operations  the current regulatory framework within which these companies operate allows for full collection of fuel and gas costs in rates 
consequently  there is limited commodity price risk after consideration of the related rate making 
as the utility industry deregulates  the company will be divesting its commodity related energy businesses and therefore will be further reducing its exposure to commodity related risk 
forward looking information this report contains forward looking statements which are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions 
certain factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  variations in weather  changes in the regulatory environment  customers preferences on energy sources  general economic conditions  increased competition and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict  and many of which are beyond the control of the company

regulatory matters restructuring activity electric and gas industry restructuring and the process for separating the competitive retail sale of the electric and gas energy from the regulated delivery of that energy over a utility s transmission and distribution system has been the predominant focus of the company s regulatory initiatives and activities in both massachusetts and new hampshire 
since march  all electric consumers in massachusetts served by investor owned utilities have had the ability to choose their electric energy supplier 
fg e  the company s massachusetts utility operating subsidiary  began implementation of its comprehensive electric restructuring plan that includes the divestiture of its entire regulated power supply business 
in new hampshire  ceco and e h  our electric utility operating subsidiaries  and unitil power corp  our wholesale power company  continue to prepare for the the transition that will move them into this new market structure pending resolution of key restructuring policies and issues that have slowed the restructing process in the state 
massachusetts gas industry restructuring plans continue to be a major focus of our regulatory activities as well 
since  fg e has worked in collaboration with the other massachusetts local distribution companies ldcs and various other stakeholders to develop and implement the infrastructure to offer gas customers choice of their competitive gas energy supplier and to complete the restructuring of gas service provided by ldcs 
fg e is required to file with the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy mdte new gas tariffs to implement natural gas unbundling in accordance with model terms and conditions resulting from these collaborative efforts 
the target date for implementation of approved tariffs and final rules is april  massachusetts electric on january   the mdte approved fg e s restructuring plan with certain modifications 
the plan provides customers with a the ability to choose an energy supplier  b an option to purchase standard offer service provided by fg e at regulated rates for up to seven years  and c a cumulative rate reduction 
the order also approved fg e s power supply divestiture plan for its interest in three generating units and four long term power supply contracts 
the company has been afforded full recovery of any transition costs through a non bypassable retail transition charge 
pursuant to the plan  on october   fg e filed a proposed contract with constellation power services inc for provision of standard offer service 
service under the fg e constellation contract commenced on march   and is scheduled to continue through february  this contract is the result of the first successful standard offer auction conducted in massachusetts

the act mandated a rate reduction in march  to be followed by an additional  inflation adjusted rate reduction by september  the net rate decrease of reflects fg e s divestiture of its generation assets and purchased power portfolio 
on december   fg e filed with the mdte new rates for effect january  the revised rates maintain the required inflation adjusted rate discount 
the mdte approved the rates on january   subject to reconciliation pursuant to an investigation  resulting in an upward inflation adjustment of relative to september rates 
the mdte has issued a notice of public hearing and procedural conference to examine electric restructuring issues including  but not limited to  consistency of the proposed charges and adjustments with the methods approved in fg e s restructuring plan 
as a result of restructuring and divestiture of fg e s generation and purchased power portfolio  fg e has accelerated the write off of its electric generation assets and on fg e s abandoned investment in seabrook station 
an mdte order established the return to be earned on the unamortized balance of fg e s generation plant 
the new return reduces fg e s earnings on its generation assets 
as this portfolio is amortized over the next years  earnings from this segment of fg e s utility business will continue to decline and ultimately cease 
currently  unitil s earnings from this business segment represent approximately of total consolidated earnings 
massachusetts gas in mid  the mdte directed all massachusetts natural gas ldcs to form a collaborative with other stakeholders to develop common principles and appropriate regulations for the unbundling of gas service  and directed fg e and four other ldcs to file unbundled gas rates for its review 
fg e s unbundled gas rates were filed with  and approved by  the mdte and implemented in november on february   the mdte issued an order in which it determined that the ldcs would continue to have an obligation to provide gas supply and delivery services for another five years  with a review after three years 
this order also set forth the mdte s decision regarding release by ldcs of their pipeline capacity contracts to competitive marketers 
in march  the ldcs and other stakeholders filed a settlement with the mdte which set forth rules for implementing an interim firm transportation service through october  the interim service will ultimately be superseded by the permanent transportation service  expected to begin april  the mdte approved the settlement on april  fg e has made separate compliance filings that were approved by the mdte to implement its interim firm gas transportation service for its largest general service customers effective june  and to complement this service with a firm gas peaking service 
on november  the massachusetts ldcs filed model terms and conditions for gas service  including provisions for capacity assignment  peaking service and default service 
in accordance with the mdte s approval of these model terms and conditions in january  fg e is required to file company specific tariffs that implement natural gas unbundling 
the mdte has also opened a rulemaking proceeding on proposed regulations that would govern the unbundling of services related to the provision of natural gas 
the target date for implementation of approved tariffs and final rules is april  new hampshire on february   the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc issued its final plan for new hampshire electric utilities to transition to a competitive electric market in the state final plan 
the final plan linked the interim recovery of stranded cost by the state s utilities to a comparison of their existing rates with the regional average utility rates 
ceco s and e h s rates are below the regional average  thus  the nhpuc found that ceco and e h were entitled to full interim stranded cost recovery  as defined by the nhpuc 
however  the nhpuc also made certain legal rulings  which could affect ceco s and e h s long term ability to recover all of its stranded costs 
northeast utilities affiliate  public service company of new hampshire  filed suit in us district court for protection from the final plan and related orders and was granted an indefinite stay 
in june  unitil  and other utilities in new hampshire  intervened as plaintiffs in the federal court proceeding 
in june  the federal court clarified that the injunctions issued by the court in had effectively frozen the nhpuc s efforts to implement restructuring 
this amended injunction was challenged by the nhpuc  but affirmed by the first circuit court of appeals in december unitil continues to be a plaintiff intervenor in federal district court and cross motions for summary judgement by all parties are now under review by the court 
during  unitil took steps to settle all of the outstanding issues related to the final plan and the federal court litigation over electric industry restructuring 
in september  unitil reached a settlement with key parties and filed this unopposed agreement with the nhpuc for approval 
however  the nhpuc imposed unacceptable conditions to approval of the settlement  and ceco and e h withdrew the proposed settlement from further nhpuc review 
unitil has continued to work actively to explore additional settlement opportunities and to seek a fair and reasonable resolution of key restructuring policies and issues in new hampshire 
the company is also monitoring the regulatory and legislative proceedings dealing with electric restructuring for other utilities in new hampshire 
rate proceedings the last formal regulatory filings to increase base electric rates for unitil s three retail operating subsidiaries occurred in for ceco  for fg e  and for e h 
a majority of the company s operating revenues are collected under various periodic rate adjustment mechanisms including fuel  purchased power  cost of gas  energy efficiency  and restructuring related cost recovery mechanisms 
industry restructuring will continue to change the methods of how certain costs are recovered through the company s regulated rates and tariffs 
on may   fg e filed a gas base rate case with the mdte 
the last base rate case had been in after evidentiary hearings  the mdte issued an order allowing fg e to establish new rates  effective november   that would produce an annual increase of approximately million in gas revenues 
as part of the proceeding  the massachusetts attorney general alleged that fg e had double collected fuel inventory finance charges  and requested that the mdte require fg e to refund approximately million in double collections since the company believes that the attorney general s claim is without merit and that a refund was not justified or warranted 
the mdte rejected the attorney general s request and stated its intent to open a separate proceeding to investigate the attorney general s claim 
on november   the mdte issued an order of notice initiating an investigation of this matter 
this proceeding is underway and is expected to be concluded in the second quarter of on october   the mdte initiated a proceeding designed to result in the eventual implementation of performance based ratemaking pbr for all electric and gas distribution utilities in massachusetts 
pbr is a method of setting regulated distribution rates that provide incentives for utilities to control costs while maintaining a high level of service quality 
under pbr  a company s earnings are tied to performance targets  and penalties can be imposed for deterioration of service quality 
on december   fg e filed a petition with the mdte for authority to defer for later recovery costs associated with its preparation of a pbr filing for its gas division and its participation in the mdte initiated generic gas and electric pbr proceedings 
this petition is pending 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that pbr would have on the company s ability to continue applying the standards of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
on december   the massachusetts attorney general initiated a complaint against fg e 
the attorney general requested that the mdte launch an investigation of the distribution rates  rate of return  and depreciation accrual rates for fg e s electric operations in calendar year to date  the mdte has taken no action on the attorney general s complaint 
millstone unit no 
fg e has a nonoperating ownership in the millstone unit no 
millstone nuclear generating unit which supplies it with megawatts mw of electric capacity 
in january  the nuclear regulatory commission nrc placed millstone on its watch list  which calls for increased nrc inspection attention 
in march  as a result of engineering evaluations  millstone was taken out of service 
the nrc authorized the restart of millstone in june during the period that millstone was out of service  fg e continued to incur its proportionate share of the unit s ongoing operations and maintenance o m costs  and may incur additional o m costs and capital expenditures to meet nrc requirements 
fg e also incurred costs to replace the power that was expected to be generated by the unit 
during the outage  fg e incurred approximately million in replacement power costs  and recovered those costs through its electric fuel charge  which is subject to review and reconciliation by the mdte 
under existing mdte precendent  fg e s replacement power costs of million could be subject to disallowance in rates 
in august  fg e  in concert with other non operating joint owners  filed a demand for arbitration in connecticut and a lawsuit in massachusetts  in an effort to recover costs associated with the extended unplanned shutdown 
several preliminary rulings have been issued in the arbitration and legal cases  and both cases are continuing 
nonoperating owners representing of millstone ownership have settled their claims with northeast utilities while nonoperating owners  including fg e  representing of millstone continue to pursue the arbitration and legal cases 
market risk although unitil s utility operating companies are subject to commodity price risk as part of their traditional operations  the current regulatory framework within which these companies operate allows for full collection of fuel and gas costs in rates 
consequently  there is limited commodity price risk after consideration of the related rate making
