item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview usbn s net income is derived primarily from net interest income of the banks  which is the difference between interest earned on their loan and investment portfolios and their cost of funds  primarily interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
for the years ended december    and  usbn s average net interest margins were   and  respectively 
prior reported amounts have been restated to reflect the merger with awb using the pooling of interests accounting method 
net income is also affected by levels of provisions for loan losses  noninterest income primarily service charges on deposits  insurance commissions  and other operating income and noninterest expenses primarily salaries and benefits  occupancy expense  data processing cost  legal and professional services expense  business and occupation tax  and other operating expenses 
for the three years ended december    and  the provision for loan losses was   and  respectively 
net charge offs during the year ended december  was  as compared to  and  during and  respectively

usbn completed its merger with americanwest bank awb effective february  at the time of the merger awb was known as bank of the west  but in june it received  for the sale of its name 
the income from the sale of the name added  to net income or 
per share 
as of february  awb had approximately million in total assets  million in deposits  million in loans  and million in total equity 
 usbn shares were issued to awb shareholders for the merger 
the pooling of interests accounting method is being used for the transaction  which includes restating prior  reported amounts to reflect the merger with awb 
usbn completed its merger with grant national bank gnb effective july   and issued  common shares in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of gnb 
as of july  gnb had approximately million in assets  million in deposits  million in loans  and million in total equity 
the pooling of interests accounting method is being used for the transaction  which includes restating prior  reported amounts to reflect the merger with gnb 
for nonrecurring items netted out to an insignificant impact on net earnings 
in  usbn recovered from its insurance provider  for a theft by a former employee of its bank subsidiary  home security bank 
after income taxes the recovery improved net income by  or 
per share 
usbn completed an acquisition of the bank of pullman bop in october for  the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction 
accordingly  the results of operations of bop increased net income of usbn subsequent to the date of acquisition 
the acquisition increased assets by million  intangible assets by million  and deposits by million as of december  return on average assets was   and for   and  respectively 
return on average equity was   and for   and  respectively 
without the nonrecurring items described above  return on assets would have been   and for   and  respectively 
return on equity would have been   and for   and  respectively 
net interest income 
net interest income increased to  in compared to the increase in was to  over results 
the net interest income improvements were primarily the result of loan volume increases in and usbn s net interest margin to average earning assets was   and in   and  respectively 
as market interest rates declined in late and early the yield on earning assets declined in to from in this was more than offset by the decline in interest bearing liabilities cost from to 
the result was a net interest margin improvement from to in the usbn improvement in net interest income due to loan volume was  and  for and  respectively 
the decline in the loan net interest income due to interest rate decreases was  and  in and  respectively 
noninterest income 
noninterest income  which consists of fees and service charges  insurance commissions  securities gains and losses  and other income  increased in to  from  in and from  in a gain on the sale of the bank of the west name was included in income 
fees and service charges for banking services increased by in reaching  insurance commissions and gains on securities sales were down in other income was lower in because of nonrecurring income in from the sale of commercial property and merchant credit card relationships  which was offset by a loss on the sale of a branch building 
insurance proceeds of  were included in noninterest income for the recovery of an employee theft 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense declined by in to  after increasing by in to  the decline was significant because usbn opened new branches in  while consolidating and closing branches 
the number of employees increased in to  while salaries and benefits expense were nearly identical in and occupancy expense increased with the new locations 
noninterest expense was higher in primarily due to gnb and awb merger expense 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was reduced in due to a  tax credit for the renovation of a historical property 
forward looking statements 
the following discussions contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of plsra 
usbn desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the plsra as they apply to forward looking statements 
usbn s ability to predict the results of future plans is inherently uncertain  and is subject to factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
impact of the year issue 
the rollover into the year occurred without any disruption to usbn and it does not anticipate any problems during however  usbn continues to be vigilant monitoring its loan portfolio and customer base for potential emerging problems 
liquidity and capital resources management believes that usbn s cash flow will be sufficient to support its existing operations for the foreseeable future 
if usbn needs additional liquidity  it would be required to borrow or issue additional capital stock 
usbn s ability to incur indebtedness is limited by government regulations and its ability to service borrowings is dependent upon the availability of dividends from the banks and nonbank subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends by the banks is subject to limitations imposed by law and governmental regulations 
the banks may borrow on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds 
bank borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity of repricing intervals of assets 
at december  usbn had approximately million of unused lines of credit available for liquidity purposes 
usbn s total stockholders equity increased to  at december   from  at december  and  at december  at december   stockholders equity was of total assets  compared to at december  at december   usbn held cash and cash equivalent assets of million 
at december   virtually all of usbn s securities million were available for sale 
the capital levels of usbn and each of the banks exceed applicable regulatory well capitalized guidelines at december  effects of inflation and changing prices 
the primary impact of inflation on usbn s operations is increased asset yields  deposit costs and operating overhead 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
the effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets  and if significant  would require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than would otherwise be necessary 
new accounting pronouncements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
entitled accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas statement no 
the statement amends sfas no 
to defer its effective date to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  management does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on usbn s financial condition or results of operation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management considers interest rate risk to be a market risk that could have a significant effect on the financial condition and results of operations of usbn 
usbn does not use derivatives including forward and futures contracts  options  and swaps to manage its market and interest rate risks 
all of usbn s transactions are denominated in us dollars 
approximately of usbn s loan portfolio has interest rates  which float with the lending bank s reference interest rate 
fixed rate loans are generally made with a term of five years or less 
general economic conditions  regulatory policy and competition in the marketplace affect interest income and cost of funds 
the banks operating strategies focus on asset liability management 
the purpose of asset liability management alm is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting the banks and usbn s earnings from undue interest rate risk 
each of the banks follows an alm policy for controlling exposure to interest rate risk 
the alm policy is established by a committee in each bank and is reviewed  approved and administered by the asset liability committee of usbn 
the alm policy is also designed to maintain an appropriate balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to maximize interest rate spreads 
the banks monitor the sensitivity of their assets and liabilities with respect to changes in interest rates and maturities  and direct the allocation of their funds accordingly 
the strategy of each bank has been to maintain  to the extent possible  a balanced position between assets and liabilities  and to place emphasis on the sensitivity of its assets 
the following table presents estimated maturity or pricing information indicating usbn s exposure to interest rate changes as of december  the expected maturities take into consideration historical and estimated principal prepayments for loans and securities 
principal prepayments are the amounts of principal reduction in addition to contractual amortization 
fixed rate and variable rate loans are expected to have payment rates of     and for the following five years  respectively 
securities principal payments are based on payment speeds as of december  the expected maturities for financial liabilities with no stated maturity reflect historical and estimated future roll off rates 
the anticipated annual roll off rates for noninterest bearing deposits  interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits are 
the interest rates disclosed are based on rates from results 
fair values are based on the calculations used in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as disclosed in the financial statements

it requires assumptions about the projection of loan and securities prepayments  loan originations and liability funding sources  which may be inaccurate 
weighted average interest rates by expected maturity are not available
