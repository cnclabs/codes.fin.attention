item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
the profitability of the company s operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to the average realized prices of oil and gas sold  the volume of oil and gas produced and the results of acquisition  development and exploration activities 
the average realized prices of oil and gas will fluctuate from one period to another due to market conditions 
the aggregate amount of oil and gas produced may fluctuate based on development and exploitation of oil and gas reserves and other factors 
production rates  value based production taxes  labor and maintenance expenses are expected to be the principal influences on operating costs 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company may fluctuate from period to period 
oil and gas reserves 
estimates of reserve quantities and related future net cash flows are calculated using unescalated year end oil and gas prices and operating costs  and may be subject to substantial fluctuations based on the prices in effect at the end of each year 
the following table sets forth a comparison of year end reserves  the weighted average prices used in calculating estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows  pre tax future net cash flows discounted at  and per barrel of oil equivalent discounted cash flows at the end of  and quantities in thousands  except for pricing and per barrel of oil equivalent amounts sec year end year end sec pre tax proved reserves prices pre tax values oil mbbls gas mmcf boe oil gas values per boe gas converted at  mcf per barrel 
reserve revisions occur when the economic limit of a property is lengthened or shortened due to changes in commodity pricing 
the following excerpt from the footnotes to the company s financial statements shows the effect of changing oil prices on the volume of oil reserves shown in thousands of barrels year ended december  proved oil reserves s beginning of year    revisions of previous estimates   extensions and discoveries acquisition of minerals in place  sales of minerals in place production end of year    the revisions of  and  barrels in and  respectively  are primarily price related 
excluding revisions to previous estimates  the company s drilling and acquisition activities  which were curtailed for much of the year  added  barrels of oil equivalent reserves  of total oil and gas production 
drilling and acquisition activities  which were also reduced in that year from prior years  added  barrels of oil equivalent to the company s proved reserve base  replacing of production 
the company did not make any producing property acquisitions in in  the company added million barrels of oil equivalent  equal to of oil and gas production 
further information concerning the company s reserve volumes and values can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for assets held for disposal  requires successful efforts companies to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying costs of their proved oil and gas properties by comparing the expected undiscounted future net revenues from each producing field with the related net capitalized costs at the end of each period 
when the net capitalized costs exceed the undiscounted future net revenues  the cost of the property is written down to fair value  which is determined using discounted future net revenues from the producing field 
during  the company recorded an impairment of proved oil and gas properties of   net of tax associated with certain properties that experienced increased operating costs  declining production and other technical problems that reduced their economic reserves 
primarily as a result of depressed year end oil prices  the company recorded proved property impairment charges of  in during  the company recorded proved property impairment charges of  results of operations comparison of with oil and gas production and sales 
oil and gas sales increased more than in over levels 
higher oil and gas prices were offset somewhat by decreases in both oil and gas production 
total revenues increased from to oil production decreased in  as a number of the company s high cost  low margin oil wells were shut in during the first several months of the year 
oil production was  barrels  compared to  barrels in gas production decreased to bcf in from bcf in gas production declined primarily as a result of reduced drilling in california during and  as well as the sale of the company s texas gas properties during the fourth quarter of while average year end oil prices in were more than double those of year end  the average price received for the entire year increased a more modest 
higher second half prices were offset by abnormally low prices in the first half of the year 
the company s average oil price for the full year of was compared to per barrel realized during gas prices were also higher  averaging per mcf in compared to per mcf in lease operating costs 
lease operating costs decreased over the prior year 
higher per unit costs were offset by reduced volumes 
per unit costs rose as the company recorded higher value based production taxes associated with higher oil prices 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
dd a per unit charges decreased from per boe in to per boe in the primary reason for the per unit decrease was the elimination of approximately million from the company s depletable base through a property impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in addition  higher oil prices enabled the company to record positive reserve revisions  which in turn decreased dd a rates for many of the company s oil properties 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
as discussed previously  included in the statement of operations for and are non cash charges for the impairment of proved oil and gas properties in the amount of  and  respectively 
equity loss in symskaya exploration  incorporated 
the equity loss in symskaya exploration decreased by  during as operations continue to be curtailed at the project  symskaya terminated its only domestic employee  and further reduced administrative expenses in the loss included  of accrued interest income on a senior note between symskaya and the company that had been recognized in prior periods 
the amount also included the company s share of a bottom hole contribution that was not repeated in d seismic and exploration expenses 
lower exploration costs in resulted from the company s reduced drilling program 
during  the company incurred approximately  in dry hole costs compared to approximately  in in addition  as a result of the company s cost cutting measures in  the company reduced other exploratory geological and administrative costs by in  the company incurred d seismic charges in the amount of  associated with its sequoia prospect in california 
the company curtailed its use of d seismic in in response to low oil prices during the first part of the year 
general and administrative expenses 
the company cut its general and administrative expenses by  or  from levels 
in response to abnormally low oil prices in the beginning of  the company made a concerted effort to reduce overhead costs through staff reductions  lower compensation costs  reduced employee benefits and other costs 
interest and income taxes 
lower interest costs in reflect lower average interest rates on the debt outstanding under the company s credit facility 
the income tax expense benefits recorded for both periods reflect the results of operations  as well as various credits available to the company 
details concerning the components of the tax provision can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
comparison of with oil and gas production and sales 
lower oil and gas prices offset higher oil and gas production during  resulting in a drop in oil and gas sales 
gas production of bcf in was higher than bcf produced in oil production of  barrels was higher than the  barrels produced in average oil prices for were lower than those of the company s average oil price received for was per barrel  compared to per barrel in gas prices also dropped by  averaging in  compared to in further details of production and pricing are found in item properties  under the caption production 
other income 
during  the company recorded a gain on the sale of certain oil and gas properties of approximately  in addition  the company sold its minority interest in an oil field technology research company 
in connection with the sale  the company recognized a gain of approximately  there were no corresponding events in lease operating costs 
lease operating costs declined on a per unit basis in costs per boe during of were lower than costs of per boe during during much of  the company shut in several high cost  marginally economic wells whose profitability was severely curtailed by low oil prices 
another factor in the decline was a reduction in value based production taxes 
as the majority of the company s production on a barrel of oil equivalent basis comes from crude oil  the decline in average oil prices in brought about declines in production taxes 
in addition  operating costs associated with natural gas properties are lower on a boe basis than for oil producing properties 
the company s ratio of gas to oil production rose in compared to prior years  and as it did so  per boe operating costs declined 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization dd a 
dd a charges in declined slightly to per barrel of oil equivalent from per barrel of oil equivalent in impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
as discussed previously  included in the statement of operations for and are non cash charges for the impairment of proved oil and gas properties in the amount of  and  respectively 
equity loss in symskaya exploration  incorporated 
in  symskaya entered into a bottom hole contribution agreement to support the drilling of an exploratory well being drilled near the southern block of acreage that symskaya holds as part of its million acre exploration  development and production license 
the equity loss in symskaya increased by approximately  during this increase included a write down of approximately  of accrued interest income on a senior note between symskaya and the company that had been recognized in prior periods 
in addition  the increase included the company s share of the bottom hole contribution 
there were no corresponding events in d seismic and exploration expenses 
during  the company incurred  in d seismic costs related to its exploration programs  compared to  in the bulk of d costs were associated with its sequoia project in the san joaquin basin of california 
exploration expenses decreased as the company drilled exploratory dry holes in  compared to dry holes in interest and income taxes 
higher interest costs in reflect the higher amount of debt outstanding under the company s credit facility 
the income tax benefits recorded for both periods result primarily from the deferred tax benefits associated with net losses reported

liquidity and capital resources higher oil prices  lower expenses and improved financial results have led to an overall strengthening in the company s financial position at december  the company s cash balances increased by from december  working capital at december  was higher than that at december  the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities also improved  reaching to at december  compared to to at the end of cash flow from operating activities more than doubled in  increasing over levels 
during  the company cut its capital spending by compared to the reduction reflected lower first half oil and gas prices  as well as the uncertainty surrounding the futures markets 
as oil prices strengthened during the year  the company increased its capital spending  of total capital spending occurred in the fourth quarter 
the company s capital expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of certain oil and gas properties 
the company sold all of its texas gas producing properties during in september of  the company announced a new million reducing revolving credit facility with bank one texas  na the facility has an initial commitment of million  and replaces a prior facility with hsbc investment bank 
the maturity date of the facility is september   three years from the date of closing 
the new facility has a libor or a prime interest rate option  the average interest rate on debt outstanding at december  was percent 
the company s commitment under its credit facility is subject to a redetermination as of may and november of each year  with estimated future oil and gas prices used in the evaluation determined by the company s lender 
as of december   the company had  of remaining availability on the facility 
the company is in compliance with all its facility covenants 
during  the company increased borrowings under its credit facility by  which were used to fund investments in property and equipment and for working capital purposes 
higher revenues and cash flows in enabled the company to make principal payments of  on its facility 
as part of the new credit facility  the company is required to hedge at least but not more than of its daily oil production  at a price not lower than the lowest price used in the bank s price deck  for a period between and months 
the company has days after the closing date to have the hedge or hedges in place 
the company entered into one collar agreement for months effective october   covering barrels per day with a floor at per barrel and a ceiling at per barrel 
the company entered into a second collar agreement for months effective january   covering barrels per day with a floor at per barrel and a ceiling at per barrel 
as a result of the hedge entered into effective october   revenues were reduced by  during the fair value of this hedge at december  was approximately 
no hedging transactions occurred in and the company believes that existing cash balances  cash flow from operating activities  and funds available under the company s credit facility will provide adequate resources to meet its capital and exploration spending objectives for the company has adequate liquidity to maintain its operations as they currently exist
