uncertainty due to the year issue the year issue relates to the ability of computer systems to properly interpret date information for the year and beyond 
in january  the company initiated an enterprise wide project to address year issues with respect to the company s computer software and information technology systems 
the initiative had as its focus two distinct areas that include year compliance of the company s software  systems and technology platforms and the evaluation of the year preparedness of significant third parties with whom the company conducts business  including vendors and customers 
the company has completed this initiative at no material cost 
the company s systems do not interface electronically with those of its customers or clients 
as such  the company s exposure to the year issue with respect to customers and clients is limited to the possibility that information supplied by these companies could not be of sufficient quality or timeliness and therefore could indirectly affect the quality or timeliness of the company s own data 
the company communicated with its significant clients and service providers to assess their vulnerability and readiness to comply with year issues and addressed compliance risks with each new significant vendor as they arose

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is subject to market risk arising from the potential change in value of its various financial instruments 
these changes may be due to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign currency rates  or both in the case of foreign currency investments 
the company monitors its exposure to interest rate and currency rate risk on a quarterly basis and currently does not believe that the use of derivatives to manage such risk is necessary 
the company intends to reevaluate the need for a formal hedging strategy on a periodic basis  and may determine that such a strategy  including the use of derivative instruments  is appropriate in the future 
interest rate risk the largest source of market risk for the company is interest rate risk on its portfolio of fixed maturity investments  especially fixed rate instruments 
in addition  the credit worthiness of the issuer  relative values of alternative investments  liquidity and general market conditions may affect fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments 
the company s general strategy with respect to fixed maturity securities is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant concentrations in individual issuers industry segments or countries 
generally  it is expected that an increase in market interest rates will cause a decline in the value of the company s investment portfolio  whereas a decrease in rates may cause an increase in value 
the following table shows the approximate effect on the value of the company s fixed maturities investment portfolio  based on hypothetical changes in market interest rates for the year ended december  and basis basis basis market basis basis basis points points points value points points points us dollars in thousands december         december         the changes in portfolio values shown were ascertained by calculating the market yield of each bond given its actual market price at december  and  raising or lowering each bond s yield by the hypothetical changes in market interest rates indicated above and  then calculating the resulting prices and the resulting aggregate market values 
the modeled yield changes are assumed to occur instantaneously and equally across the yield curve 
price changes of floating rate bonds were calculated assuming coupons adjusted by the modeled amounts at their next scheduled reset date 
effects on portfolio value of prepayment related interest rate changes in the case of mortgage backed securities are de minimis 
the values indicated above are estimates and are necessarily based on various assumptions that are subjective in nature 
accordingly  the actual impact of changes in market rates on the company s investment portfolio may be significantly greater or less than those indicated above 
foreign currency risk the company s functional currency is the us dollar 
however  the company writes reinsurance business in numerous geographic regions and currencies  giving rise to the risk that the ultimate settlement of receivables and payables on reinsurance transactions will differ from the amounts currently recorded as assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the company intends to hold investments in currencies in which it will collect premiums and pay claims  thus creating a partial natural hedge against exchange rate fluctuations 
the company believes that its exposure to foreign currency risk is not material 
inflation inflation has not had a material impact on the company s operations for any of the three years presented 
the company has commenced writing reinsurance in latin america  particularly in brazil  which has experienced periods of high inflation 
however  it is possible that future inflationary conditions may impact subsequent accounting periods
