as a result of the termination of this contract  the recoverability of the company s goodwill associated with the idp acquisition was significantly impaired 
accordingly  management recorded an impairment charge of approximately million during additionally  the small business administration sba ruled that the us air force must terminate the contract for the convenience of the government 
under a termination for convenience  the government shall reimburse the company for all costs incurred in the performance of the contract

of the million  approximately  related to lost wages and benefits for the two remaining years under the agreement 
the balance of the award  million  represented the proceeds from stock options fair market value less grant price had the employee exercised all  options in november the options were granted to the former employee in september in conjunction with the stms acquisition and had a three year vesting period

the contract was protested and hence delayed due to negotiations between the government and vendors in order to resolve the protest issues 
the protest was ultimately resolved and the company was re awarded the contract in january during that month delay period  management determined to continue operations at the company s puerto rican facility in anticipation of the contract 
accordingly  the company incurred significant costs to maintain the facility which resulted in an operating loss for the puerto rican subsidiary for fiscal changes in federal contracts in fiscal year  the company s revenues from computer sales to the federal government were adversely affected due to changes in procurement policies 
the changes in the policies included decentralization of purchasing decisions outside of the washington dc area  where dunn has its most significant sales coverage  the ability of computer manufacturers ie dell  compaq to sell directly to the federal government  a continual decline in pc prices throughout which resulted in the company not participating in certain government proposals for which adequate margins could not be achieved
