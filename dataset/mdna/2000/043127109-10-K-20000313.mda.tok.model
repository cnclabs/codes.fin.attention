days sales outstanding  or dso  in receivables decreased to days for compared to days for the company continued to monitor credit and collection processes during  which contributed to improved collection periods  especially in europe 
the significant increase in inventory levels from million at january  to million at december  was primarily attributable to production planning to meet manufacturing lead times  increased investment in raw materials to mitigate some lengthening of component procurement lead times  expansion of inventory depots to better service customers  and anticipated demand for new product introductions 
as a result  inventory turnover decreased to turns at december  compared to turns at january  capital expenditures for totaled million primarily for the continued upgrade of facilities and equipment in support of the company s current operating activities including million related to the implementation of a new erp computer system

the use of cash in fiscal was due mainly to the acquisition of the elba group for million net of cash acquired and increased purchases of property  plant and equipment in line with the continued upgrading of the company s overseas manufacturing facilities

and includes a fee of 
on the unused balance  both payable quarterly

any amounts outstanding under the facility are due on december  at december   the company had not repaid any portion of the million outstanding under the facility  and the company has made no additional borrowings under the facility 
the company is in compliance in all material respects with the agreement s covenants 
based on current plans and business conditions  the company believes that its cash and equivalents  its available credit line  cash generated from operations  and other financing activities are expected to be adequate to meet capital expenditures  working capital requirements  debt and capital lease obligations and operating lease commitments through recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas will require the company to record all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
the impact of sfas on the company s financial statements will depend on a variety of factors  including future interpretative guidance from the fasb  the future level of forecasted and actual foreign currency transactions  the extent of the company s hedging activities  the types of hedging instruments used and the effectiveness of such instruments 
however  given the company s current use of derivatives and hedging activities  the company does not believe the effect of adopting sfas will be material to its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement the statement defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal at which time adoption is planned 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
we believe our revenue recognition practices are in conformity with the guidelines prescribed in sab no 
impact of year the year issue was the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
in  the company formulated a plan to resolve the year issue that included the following phases awareness  assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
the plan was initiated and executed to prevent major interruptions in the business due to year problems using both internal and external resources to identify and correct problems and to test for readiness 
also  the company queried its important suppliers and customers regarding their year remediation activities and developed a contingency plan for both external and internal sources of non compliance 
as of december   all phases were completed 
during  the company initiated the implementation and installation of a new erp system  which was a planned system change and was not deemed undertaken solely for the company to become year compliant 
the company completed the replacement of its existing internal computer systems to a new year compliant erp system throughout north america in july of the implementation of the new year compliant erp system for the company s european and asia pacific locations is scheduled for completion by mid year the total cost incurred for all phases of the year project  excluding the implementation of the erp system  was approximately million  of which approximately  was incurred in and approximately million was incurred in of the total amount  approximately million related to equipment purchases which was capitalized and approximately million was expensed as incurred 
these costs were funded through operating cash flows 
since january   the company has experienced no disruptions in its business operations as a result of year compliance problems and received no reports of any year compliance issues from either internal or external sources 
nonetheless  some problems related to year risks may not appear until several months after january  year issues could include problems with the company s own products and services or with third party products or technology that we use 
the company can provide no assurance that all supplier and customer year compliance plans were successfully completed in a timely manner  although it is not currently aware of any problems  which would significantly impact its operations 
conversion to the euro currency on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the legacy currencies of the participating european union members will remain legal tender in the participating countries for the transition period from january  through january  beginning january   the participating countries will issue new euro denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions 
legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender for any transactions beginning july   making conversion to the euro complete 
the company has begun to assess and address the issues involved with the introduction of the euro 
issues facing the company relating to the euro include converting information technology systems  reassessing currency risk  negotiating and amending licensing agreements and contracts  and processing tax and accounting records 
the company does not presently expect that introduction and use of the euro will materially affect the company s foreign exchange and hedging activities or the company s use of derivative instruments 
while the company will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro s introduction over time  based on currently available information  management does not believe that the introduction of the euro currency will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or overall trends in results of operations 
risk factors that may affect future results as noted above  the foregoing discussion may include forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
in addition  the company has identified the following risk factors that could affect its actual results and cause them to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
risks related to new products the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  increasing customer demands  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and  in some cases  short product life cycles 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and cost  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop  introduce or manage the transition of new products 
the failure of or the delay in anticipating technological advances or developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to any significant technological change could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
reliance on customers sales to three customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of sales in decisions by a small number of customers to defer their purchasing decisions or to purchase products elsewhere could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations and financial condition of the company 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results recently  the company has experienced erratic quarterly growth in sales partially due to customers realigning their inventory needs and also partially attributable to year uncertainty 
due to the rapidly changing nature of the markets for its products  as well as the likelihood of increased competition  there can be no assurance that the company s sales and operating results will maintain their past growth rates 
if sales are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of any shortfall on the operating results of the company may be magnified to the extent the company is unable to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability in the future  particularly on a quarter to quarter basis 
competition increased competition due to industry consolidation the industry in which the company competes is highly competitive and characterized by increasing customer demands for product performance  shorter manufacturing cycles and lower prices 
these trends result in frequent introductions of new products with added capabilities and features and continuous improvements in the relative price performance of the products 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share  each of which could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s principal competitors include lucent technologies  delta product and astec bsr plc 
certain of the company s major competitors have also been engaged in merger and acquisition transactions 
such consolidations by competitors are likely to create entities with increased market share  customer bases  proprietary technology and marketing expertise  and expanded sales force size 
these developments may adversely affect the company s ability to compete in such markets 
risks related to gross margin the company s gross margin percentage is a function of the product mix sold in any period 
other factors such as unit volumes  heightened price competition  changes in channels of distribution  shortages in components due to timely supplies of parts from vendors or ability to obtain items at reasonable prices  and availability of skilled labor  also may affect the cost of sales and the fluctuation in gross margin percentages in future periods 
risks related to backlog the company has attempted to reduce its product manufacturing lead times and its backlog of orders 
to the extent that backlog is reduced during any particular period  it could result in more variability and less predictability in the company s quarter to quarter sales and operating results 
if manufacturing lead times are not reduced  the company s customers may cancel  or not place  orders if shorter lead times are available from other manufacturers risks related to intellectual property rights the company currently relies upon a combination of patents  copyrights  trade marks and trade secret laws to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
although the company continues to evaluate and implement protective measures  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that third parties will not assert intellectual property infringement claims against the company 
risks related to acquisitions acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies  including technologies and products under development  have been an important part of the company s business strategy 
acquisitions require significant financial and management resources both at the time of the transaction and during the process of integrating the newly acquired business into the company s operations 
the company s operating results could be adversely affected if it is unable to successfully integrate such new companies into its operations 
future acquisitions by the company could also result in issuances of equity securities or the rights associated with the equity securities  which could potentially dilute your stakeholdings and or the company s earnings per share 
in addition  future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt  or contingent liabilities  and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
these factors could adversely affect the company s future operating results and financial position 
dependence on sole source suppliers as a result of the custom nature of certain of the company s manufactured products  components used in the manufacture of these products are currently obtained from a limited number of suppliers 
although there are a limited number of manufacturers of certain components  management believes that other suppliers could provide similar components on comparable terms 
a change in suppliers  however  could cause a delay in manufacturing and a possible loss of sales that could adversely affect the company s future operating results and financial position 
risks related to international sales international sales have been  and are expected to continue to be  an increasingly important component of the company s total sales 
international sales are subject to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable and potentially adverse tax consequences 
other risks of international sales include changes in economic conditions in the international markets in which the products are sold  political and economic instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  import and export controls  and the burden and expense of complying with foreign laws 
in addition  sales in developing nations may fluctuate to a greater extent than sales to customers in developed nations  as those markets are only beginning to adopt new technologies and establish purchasing practices 
these risks may adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the company 
risks related to government regulations and product certification the company s operations are subject to laws  regulations  government policies and product certification requirements worldwide 
changes in such laws  regulations  policies or requirements could affect the demand for the company s products or result in the need to modify products  which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on the company s future operating results 
risks related to foreign manufacturing operations the company manufactures a significant amount of its products in foreign locations 
approximately of the company s sales were from products manufactured in asia pacific  from products manufactured in europe and the remaining from domestic operations 
the supply and cost of these products can be adversely affected  among other reasons  by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  increased import duties  imposition of tariffs  imposition of import quotas  interruptions in sea or air transportation and political or economic changes 
from time to time  the company explores opportunities to diversify its sourcing and or production of certain products to other low cost locations or with other third parties to reduce its dependence on production in any one location 
in addition  the company has taken necessary measures  including insuring against certain risks  to mitigate its exposure to potential political and economic changes in hong kong and china 
in the event of confiscation  expropriation  nationalization  or governmental restrictions in the above mentioned foreign or other locations  earnings could be adversely affected from business disruption resulting in delays and or increased costs in the production and delivery of products 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock has been  and  may continue to be  relatively volatile 
factors such as new product announcements by the company  its customers or its competitors  quarterly fluctuations in operating results  challenges associated with integration of businesses and general conditions in the markets in which the company competes  such as a decline in industry growth rates  may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
these conditions  as well as factors which generally affect the market for stocks of technology companies  could cause the price of the company s common stock to significantly fluctuate over relatively short periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies using a variety of derivative financial instruments 
the company attempts to manage the interest rate risk on its variable rate debt instruments through use of interest rate swaps pursuant to which the company exchanges its floating rate interest obligations for fixed rates 
the fixing of the interest rates offsets substantially all of the company s exposure to the uncertainty of floating interest rates during the term of the loans 
the company has significant assets and operations in europe and asia and  as a result  its financial performance could be affected by significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate potential adverse trends  the company s operating strategy takes into account changes in exchange rates over time 
accordingly  the company enters into currency forward contracts and purchased option contracts to help protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency revenues 
the principal currencies hedged are the japanese yen  the deutsche mark  and the euro 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the amount of any gain or loss on these contracts has not been material in the past and was not material for fiscal year
