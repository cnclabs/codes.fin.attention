we will provide million in funding for development 
envoy is being accounted for as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  the operating results and balance sheet items of envoy have been reflected separately from continuing operations 
contract revenue we consider net revenue  which excludes reimbursed costs  our primary measure of revenue growth 
substantially all net revenue for the product development and commercialization service groups is earned by performing services under contracts with various pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device and healthcare companies 
many of our contracts are fixed price  with some variable components  and range in duration from a few months to several years 
we are also party to fee for service and unit of service contracts 
we recognize net revenue based upon labor costs expended as a percentage of total labor costs expected to be expended percentage of completion for fixed price contracts  contractual per diem or hourly rate basis as work is performed for fee for service contracts or completion of units of service for unit of service contracts 
our commercialization service group has entered into agreements with certain customers  whereby we provide a dedicated sales force and fund certain sales and marketing expenses  and we receive payments based on the achievement of certain sales levels of the promoted product 
during the sales force recruitment and training phase  we defer certain costs and will amortize those costs over the lesser of the contractual termination period generally one year or the proportion to revenue recognized 
our contracts generally provide for price negotiation upon scope of work changes 
we recognize revenue related to these scope changes when the underlying services are performed and realization of revenue is reasonably assured 
most contracts are terminable upon days notice by the customer 
in the event of termination  contracts typically require payment for services rendered through the date of termination  as well as subsequent services rendered to close out the contract 
any anticipated losses resulting from contract performance are charged to earnings in the period identified 
each contract specifies billing and payment procedures 
generally  the procedures require a portion of the contract fee to be paid at the time the project is initiated with subsequent contract billings and payments due periodically over the length of the project s term in accordance with contractual provisions 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is classified as unbilled services  while billings in excess of revenue recognized are classified as unearned income 
we report backlog based on anticipated net revenue from uncompleted projects which have been authorized by the customer through a written contract or otherwise 
using this method of reporting backlog  at december   and  our backlog was approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively 
we believe that backlog may not be a consistent indicator of future results because backlog can be affected by a number of factors  including the variable size and duration of projects  many of which are performed over several years  loss or significant delay of contracts or a change in the scope of a project during the course of a contract 
results of continuing operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenue for the year ended december  was billion  an increase of million or over net revenue for the year ended december  of billion 
growth occurred across each of our geographic regions and each of our major service groups 
factors contributing to the growth included an increase of contract service offerings  the provision of increased services rendered under existing contracts  the initiation of services under contracts awarded subsequent to january  and our acquisitions accounted for under purchase accounting which contributed approximately million of net revenue for the year ended december  net revenue for the product development group increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this growth was slower than anticipated as a result of several factors  including early termination and delays of clinical trials and utilization rates that were lower than historical levels 
net revenue for the commercialization group increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the net revenue for the year ended december  for the commercialization group included approximately million of net revenue contributed by a acquisition accounted for as a purchase 
net revenue for the quinternet tm informatics group increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the net revenue for the year ended december  for the quinternet tm informatics group included approximately million of net revenue contributed by a acquisition accounted for as a purchase 
direct costs  which include compensation and related fringe benefits for billable employees  and other expenses directly related to contracts  were million or of net revenue versus million or of net revenue 
the increase in direct costs as a percentage of net revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in the utilization rates during the year ended december   as discussed above 
general and administrative expenses  which include compensation and fringe benefits for administrative employees  non billable travel  professional services  advertising  computer and facility expenses  were million or of net revenue versus million or of net revenue 
also included in general and administrative expenses were incremental costs related to our year program of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the remaining million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in personnel  facilities and locations and outside services resulting from our growth 
depreciation and amortization expense was million or of net revenue versus million or of net revenue 
amortization expense increased million due to the goodwill amortization resulting from our acquisitions accounted for under purchase accounting 
the remaining million increase is primarily due to the increase in our capitalized asset base 
income from operations was million or of net revenue versus million or of net revenue 
income from operations for the product development group increased to million or of net revenue from million or of net revenue 
the decrease as a percentage of net revenue results from the early termination and delays of clinical programs and lower utilization rates as discussed above and an increase of approximately million in incremental costs incurred related to our year program 
income from operations for the commercialization group increased to million or of net revenue from million or of net revenue 
income from operations for the quinternet tm informatics group decreased to a loss of million or of net revenue from income of million or of net revenue 
this decrease results primarily from an increase in amortization expense due to a acquisition accounted for as a purchase and the allocation of corporate overhead costs attributable to increased costs incurred to develop the informatics market in other expense  which consists primarily of transaction costs and interest  increased to million in from million in transaction costs included in other expense were million in versus million in excluding these transaction costs  other income was million for the year ended december  versus other expense of  for the year ended december  the million fluctuation was due to an increase of million of net interest income  an increase of  of gains on foreign currency and a million realized gain on the sale of an investment in marketable equity securities

general and administrative expenses  which include compensation and fringe benefits for administrative employees  non billable travel  professional services  advertising  computer and facility expenses  were million or of net revenue versus million or of net revenue 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in personnel  facilities and locations and outside services resulting from our growth 
depreciation and amortization expense was million or of net revenue versus million or of net revenue 
the million increase is primarily due to the increase in our capitalized asset base

the remainder of the purchase price  approximately million  is expected to be paid in the first half of when the acquisition of the physical facility is completed 
capital asset expenditures in included pound million approximately million related to our purchase of land and construction of a facility in bathgate  scotland 
the remaining capital expenditures were predominantly incurred in connection with the expansion of existing operations  the enhancement of information technology capabilities and the opening of new offices 
total working capital  excluding net assets of discontinued operation  decreased million to million at december  from million at december  this decrease resulted from the million of convertible subordinated notes due may  being classified as a current liability as of december  versus a long term liability as of december  trade accounts receivable and unbilled services increased to million at december  from million at december   as a result of the growth in net revenue 
trade accounts receivable and unbilled services  net of unearned income  increased to million at december  from million at december  the number of days revenue outstanding in trade accounts receivable and unbilled services  net of unearned income  were and days at december  and december   respectively 
during  the company invested approximately million in missouri tax incentive bonds 
in connection with this investment  the company entered into a loan agreement with the missouri development finance board for approximately million 
the bonds mature as we are required to make loan payments 
in may  we signed a commercialization agreement with cv therapeutics  a development stage biopharmaceutical company  to commercialize one of its products 
the agreement calls for us to conduct certain pre launch activities  hire and train a dedicated sales force to promote the product and provide post launch marketing and sales services for at least three years after launch and provide services in years four and five  if certain product sales levels are achieved 
as part of this agreement  we acquired approximately million of cvt common stock and will be required to provide a million secured credit facility to cvt if the federal drug administration accepts the cvt s new drug application for the product 
during  we acquired a clinical trial production and warehouse facility in livingston  scotland for a purchase commitment valued at pound million approximately million  with payment due in may  during  we acquired a drug development facility in edinburgh  scotland 
related to this acquisition  we entered into a purchase commitment valued at pound million approximately million 
during the payment terms were amended  and we paid approximately pound million approximately million of this commitment in october the remaining balance of approximately pound million approximately million is due in april we have a million senior unsecured credit facility with a us bank 
at december   we had million available under this facility 
based upon our current financing plan  we believe the million facility would be available to retire our credit arrangements and obligations  if necessary 
in may  we entered into a pound million approximately million unsecured line of credit with a uk bank 
we also entered into a pound million approximately million general bank facility with the same uk bank 
at december   we had pound million approximately million available under these agreements 
all foreign currency denominated amounts due  subsequent to december   have been translated using the wednesday  december  foreign exchange rates as published in the december  edition of the wall street journal 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents  together with future cash flows from operations and borrowings under our line of credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs in connection with our operations 
as part of our business strategy  we review many acquisition candidates in the ordinary course of business  and in addition to acquisitions already made  we are continually evaluating new acquisition and expansion possibilities 
we may from time to time seek to obtain debt or equity financing in our ordinary course of business or to facilitate possible acquisitions or expansion 
income taxes since we conduct operations on a global basis  our effective income tax rate has depended and will continue to depend on the amount of profits in locations with varying income tax rates 
our results of operations will be impacted by changes in the income tax rates of the various jurisdictions and by changes in any applicable tax treaties 
in particular  as the portion of our non us business varies  our effective income tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 
our effective tax rate may also depend upon the extent to which we are allowed and are able to use under applicable limitations u 
s 
foreign tax credits in respect of income taxes paid on its foreign operations 
inflation we believe the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition 
impact of year issue we have not experienced any immediate  adverse impact to our operations resulting from the millennium date change or leap year change 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that our systems and business relationships have not been impacted in a manner that is not yet apparent 
we will continue to monitor our systems in order to promptly remediate any adversely impacted systems 
the aggregate cost of our year program  including costs stemming from acquisitions  was approximately million  of which approximately million were not incremental costs but represented the redeployment of existing resources 
conversion to the euro currency on january   a new currency  the euro  became the legal currency for of the member countries of the european economic community 
between january  and january   governments  companies and individuals may conduct business in the member countries in both the euro and existing national currencies 
on january   the euro will become the sole currency in the member countries 
we conduct business in the member countries 
we have reviewed the issues involved with the introduction of the euro including whether we may have to change the prices of our services in the different countries and whether we will have to change the terms of any financial instruments in connection with our hedging activities 
the use of the euro has not had a significant impact on our business or operations 
based on current information  we do not expect the conversion to the euro to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
statement no 
requires that upon adoption  all derivative instruments be recognized in the balance sheet at fair value  and that changes in such fair values be recognized in earnings unless specific hedging criteria are met 
changes in the values of derivatives that meet these hedging criteria will ultimately offset related earnings effects of the hedged items  effects of certain changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income pending recognition in earnings 
we will adopt statement no 
when required to do so on january  because of our limited use of derivatives  we do not expect the application of statement no 
to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the market rates and prices  such as foreign currency rates  interest rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity price changes  and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes 
our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the cost and availability of appropriate financial instruments 
from time to time  we have utilized forward exchange contracts to manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the following analyses present the sensitivity of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
foreign currency exchange rates approximately  and of our net revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively  were derived from our operations outside the united states 
we do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary 
our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  and accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of our subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component reduction of shareholders equity were million at december  as compared to million at december  we may be subject to foreign currency transaction risk when our service contracts are denominated in a currency other than the currency in which we earn fees or incur expenses related to such contracts 
at december   our most significant foreign currency exchange rate exposures were in the british pound  german mark and french franc 
we limit our foreign currency transaction risk through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our contracts with customers  or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts or options 
we recognize changes in value in income only when foreign currency exchange contracts or options are settled or exercised  respectively 
there were no open foreign exchange contracts or options relating to service contracts at december  as of december   we had short term obligations denominated in a foreign currency approximately pound million 
assuming a hypothetical change of in year end exchange rates a weakening of the us dollar  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million 
interest rates at december   we had outstanding million of convertible subordinated notes due may  the fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the carrying value of the notes at december  approximates the fair value 
a increase in prevailing interest rates at december  would not result in a material decrease in the fair value of the notes due to the short term remaining until maturity 
currently  we do not hold any derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk 
at december   our investment in debt securities portfolio consists primarily of us government securities and money funds 
the portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale and therefore these investments are recorded at fair value in the financial statements 
these securities are exposed to market price risk which also takes into account interest rate risk 
as of december   the fair value of the investment portfolio was million  based on quoted market prices 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease of in quoted market price is approximately million 
equity prices at december   we had investments in marketable equity securities 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value in the financial statements 
these securities are subject to equity price risk 
as of december   the fair value of these investments was million  based on quoted equity prices 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease of in quoted equity price is approximately million 
subsequent events on january   we announced the adoption of a restructuring plan 
in connection with this plan  we anticipate recognizing a restructuring charge of approximately million during the first quarter of the restructuring charge will consist primarily of severance costs related to a worldwide workforce reduction of approximately positions and lease termination costs related to the consolidation of offices 
this restructuring is targeted to result in annualized cost savings of million to million  of which million to million are targeted to be realized in on february   the board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock from time to time over the next months in open market  block or negotiated transactions 
risk factors in addition to the other information provided in our reports  you should consider the following factors carefully in evaluating our business and us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  that we currently deem immaterial or that are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general  such as competitive conditions  may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
changes in outsourcing trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate 
economic factors and industry trends that affect our primary customers  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies also affect our business 
for example  the practice of many companies in these industries has been to hire outside organizations like us to conduct large clinical research and sales and marketing projects 
this practice has grown substantially over the past decade  and we have benefited from this trend 
some industry commentators believe that the rate of growth of outsourcing has slowed 
if these industries reduce their tendency to outsource those projects  our operations  financial condition and growth rate could be materially and adversely affected 
recently  we also believe we have been negatively impacted by pending mergers and other factors in the pharmaceutical industry  which appear to have slowed decision making by our customers and delayed certain trials 
a continuation of these trends would have an ongoing adverse effect on our business 
in addition  numerous governments have undertaken efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation  regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and pharmaceutical companies 
if future regulatory cost containment efforts limit the profits  which can be derived on new drugs  our customers may reduce their research and development spending which could reduce the business they outsource to us 
we cannot predict the likelihood of any of these events or the effects they would have on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if companies we acquire do not perform as expected or if we are unable to make strategic acquisitions  our business could be adversely affected 
a key element of our growth strategy has depended on our ability to complete acquisitions that complement or expand our business and successfully integrate the acquired companies into our operations 
in the past  some of our acquisitions performed below our expectations in the short term  but we experienced no impact to our expectations for our overall results  due in part to the size of such acquisitions and the performance of other areas of our business 
in the future  if we are unable to operate the business of an acquired company so that its results meet our expectations  those results could have a negative impact on our results as a whole 
the risk that our results may be affected if we are unable to successfully operate the businesses we acquire may increase in proportion with the size of the businesses we acquire  the lines of business we acquire and the number of acquisitions we complete in any given time period 
in addition  in recent months our acquisition activity has slowed  and we have not completed an acquisition since august as a result  we currently are not growing from acquisitions 
if we do not acquire other companies  our overall growth  when compared to historical levels  will be adversely affected 
in  we completed nine acquisitions  including pmsi and envoy  the largest acquisitions we have completed to date 
we are continually evaluating and competing for new acquisition opportunities 
other risk factors we face as a result of our acquisition strategy include the following our ability to achieve anticipated synergies from combined operations  our ability to integrate the operations and personnel of acquired companies  especially those in lines of business that differ from our current lines of business  the ability of acquired companies to meet anticipated net revenue and net income targets  potential loss of the acquired companies key employees  our ability to efficiently operate and expand the acquired companies lines of business that differ from our current lines of business  the possibility that we may be adversely affected by risk factors present at the acquired companies  potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the sellers  risks of assimilating differences in foreign business practices and overcoming language barriers for acquisitions of foreign companies  and risks experienced by companies in general that are involved in acquisitions 
if we are unable to successfully develop and market potential new services  our growth could be adversely affected 
another key element of our growth strategy is the successful development and marketing of new services that complement or expand our existing business 
if we are unable to succeed in developing new services and attracting a customer base for those newly developed services  we will not be able to implement this element of our growth strategy  and our future business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
for example  we are expanding our pharmaceutical and healthcare information and market research services 
these services involve analyzing healthcare information to study aspects of current healthcare products and procedures for use in developing new products and services or in analyzing sales and marketing of existing products 
in addition to the other difficulties associated with the development of any new service  our ability to develop these services may be limited further by contractual provisions limiting our use of the healthcare information or the legal rights of others that may prevent or impair our use of the healthcare information 
due to these and other limitations  we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop this type of service successfully 
our inability to develop new products or services or any delay in development may adversely affect our ability to maintain our rate of growth in the future 
the potential loss or delay of our large contracts could adversely affect our results 
many of our contract research customers can terminate our contracts upon days notice 
in the event of termination  our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project  but these fees may not be sufficient for us to maintain our margins  and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates 
thus  the loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect our net revenue and profitability 
we believe that this risk has potentially greater effect as we pursue larger outsourcing arrangements with global pharmaceutical companies  which may encompass global clinical trials at a number of sites and cross many service lines 
also  recently we have observed that customers may be more willing to delay  cancel or reduce contracts more rapidly than in the past 
if this becomes a trend  it could become more difficult for us to balance our resources with demands for our services and our financial results could be adversely affected 
the proposed sale of envoy may fail to close or be delayed 
the proposed sale of envoy to healtheon webmd is important to our strategic plan and  if the transaction fails to close or the closing is delayed  we may not be able to execute strategies that are critical to our continued growth as planned  if at all 
for example  we have agreed to form a strategic alliance with healtheon webmd designed to enable us to develop and market web based products and services relating to our informatics strategy  and healtheon webmd has agreed to give us access to data that is important to our informatics business 
healtheon webmd s obligation to perform under these arrangements is contingent upon closing of the envoy transaction 
as a result  if the transaction does not close  we would not be able to take advantage of the benefits of the proposed alliance as planned  and we would need to seek other partnerships or develop such capabilities internally 
these consequences may substantially delay our ability to execute our internet strategy relating to our product development and commercialization service groups and increase our costs 
the sale of envoy is subject to regulatory approval and other conditions that are beyond our control 
our backlog may not be indicative of future results 
we report backlog based on anticipated net revenue from uncompleted projects that a customer has authorized 
we cannot assure you that the backlog we have reported will be indicative of our future results 
a number of factors may affect our backlog  including the variable size and duration of projects some are performed over several years  the loss or delay of projects  and a change in the scope of work during the course of a project 
also  if customers delay projects  the projects will remain in backlog  but will not generate revenue at the rate originally expected 
accordingly  historical indications of the relationship of backlog to revenues are not indicative of the future relationship 
if we lose the services of dennis gillings or other key personnel  our business could be adversely affected 
our success substantially depends on the performance  contributions and expertise of our senior management team  led by dennis b 
gillings  phd  our chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer 
we maintain key man life insurance on dr 
gillings in the amount of million 
our performance also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified management and professional  scientific and technical operating staff  as well as our ability to recruit qualified representatives for our contract sales services 
the departure of dr 
gillings  or any key executive  or our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our product development services create a risk of liability from clinical trial participants and the parties with whom we contract 
we contract with drug companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in bringing new drugs to market 
our services include supervising clinical trials  data and laboratory analysis  patient recruitment and other services 
the process of bringing a new drug to market is time consuming and expensive 
if we do not perform our services to contractual or regulatory standards  the clinical trial process could be adversely affected 
additionally  if clinical trial services such as laboratory analysis do not conform to contractual or regulatory standards  trial participants could be affected 
these events would create a risk of liability to us from the drug companies with whom we contract or the study participants 
we also contract with physicians to serve as investigators in conducting clinical trials 
such testing creates risk of liability for personal injury to or death of volunteers  particularly to volunteers with life threatening illnesses  resulting from adverse reactions to the drugs administered during testing 
it is possible third parties could claim that we should be held liable for losses arising from any professional malpractice of the investigators with whom we contract or in the event of personal injury to or death of persons participating in clinical trials 
we do not believe we are legally accountable for the medical care rendered by third party investigators  and we would vigorously defend any such claims 
nonetheless  it is possible we could be found liable for those types of losses 
in addition to supervising tests or performing laboratory analysis  we also own a number of labs where phase i clinical trials are conducted 
phase i clinical trials involve testing a new drug on a limited number of healthy individuals  typically to persons  to determine the drug s basic safety 
we also could be liable for the general risks associated with ownership of such a facility 
these risks include  but are not limited to  adverse events resulting from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of phase i medical care providers 
we also could be held liable for errors or omissions in connection with our services 
for example  we could be held liable for errors or omissions or breach of contract if one of our laboratories inaccurately reports or fails to report lab results or if our informatics products violate rights of third parties 
we maintain insurance to cover ordinary risks but any insurance might not be adequate  and it would not cover the risk of a customer deciding not to do business with us as a result of poor performance 
relaxation of government regulation could decrease the need for the services we provide 
governmental agencies throughout the world  but particularly in the united states  highly regulate the drug development approval process 
a large part of our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through the regulatory drug approval process 
any relaxation in regulatory approval standards could eliminate or substantially reduce the need for our services  and  as a result  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
potential regulatory changes under consideration in the united states and elsewhere include mandatory substitution of generic drugs for patented drugs  relaxation in the scope of regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures 
these and other changes in regulation could have an impact on the business opportunities available to us 
failure to comply with existing regulations could result in a loss of revenue 
any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing clinical research or sales and marketing projects or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities  either of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
for example  if we were to fail to verify that informed consent is obtained from patient participants in connection with a particular clinical trial  the data collected from that trial could be disqualified  and we could be required to redo the trial under the terms of our contract at no further cost to our customer  but at substantial cost to us 
proposed regulations may increase the cost of our business or limit our service offerings 
the confidentiality of patient specific information and the circumstances under which such patient specific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business are subject to substantial government regulation 
additional legislation governing the possession  use and dissemination of medical record information and other personal health information has been proposed at both the state and federal levels 
this legislation may require us to implement security measures that may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our products and services 
these and other changes in regulation could limit our ability to offer some of our products or have an impact on the business opportunities available to us 
industry regulation may restrict our ability to analyze and disseminate pharmaceutical and healthcare data 
we are directly subject to certain restrictions on the collection and use of data 
laws relating to the collection and use of data are evolving  as are contractual rights 
we cannot assure you that contractual restrictions imposed by our customers  legislation or regulations will not  now or in the future  directly or indirectly restrict the analysis or dissemination of the type of information we gather and therefore materially adversely affect our operations 
our services are subject to evolving industry standards and rapid technological changes 
the markets for our services  particularly our quinternet tm informatics services  which include our data analysis services  are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent introduction of new and enhanced services 
to succeed  we must continue to enhance our existing services  introduce new services on a timely and cost effective basis to meet evolving customer requirements  achieve market acceptance for new services  and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we derive a large portion of our net revenue from international operations  for example  we derived approximately of our net revenue from outside the united states 
our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  thus  factors associated with international operations  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and any trends associated with the transition to the euro  could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition 
exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the us dollar create risk in several ways  including foreign currency translation risk 
the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies 
foreign currency transaction risk 
our service contracts may be denominated in a currency other than the currency in which we incur expenses related to such contracts 
we try to limit these risks through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our service contracts  or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts or options 
despite these efforts  we may still experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the united states  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to favorably reduce our currency transaction risk associated with our service contracts 
we may be adversely affected by customer concentration 
we have one customer that accounted for of our revenues for the year ended december  these revenues resulted from services provided by our product development and commercialization service groups 
if this or any future customer of similar size decreases or terminates its relationship with us  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
new healthcare legislation or regulation could restrict our informatics business 
the department of health and human services published proposed regulations setting privacy standards to protect health information that is transmitted electronically in the federal register on november  the comment period for these proposed rules ended february  we understand generally that final regulations will be issued no earlier than days after the end of the comment period  however  hhs has indicated that a significant delay is likely which will add additional months to the expected date of the final rules 
while the proposed rules  if promulgated without modification  likely would not restrict us from de identifying individual health information and providing such de identified  aggregated data to our synergy subsidiary for purposes of analysis  the proposed rule may be changed in response to comments and further modification and could be preempted by legislation 
such legislative or regulatory changes could occur as early as this year and their impact cannot be predicted 
if legislation or a more restrictive regulation is adopted  it could inhibit third party processors in using  transmitting or disclosing health data even if they have been de identified for purposes other than facilitating payment or performing other clearinghouse functions which would restrict our ability to obtain data for use in our informatics services 
in addition  it could require us to establish uniform specifications for obtaining de identified data  so that de identified data obtained from different sources could be aggregated 
third party processors  under the proposed rules  or modified rules  also may require us to provide indemnity from claims against them arising from our use of data  even in de identified form 
while the impact of developments in legislation  regulations or the demands of third party processors is difficult to predict  each could materially adversely affect our informatics business 
risks associated with discontinued operation the envoy edi business until the proposed sale of our envoy subsidiary closes  we will continue to operate envoy s edi business and will continue to be subject to the following additional risks associated with envoy s edi business 
edi services are subject to evolving industry standards and rapid technological changes the current industry standard edi platform for processing transactions could be replaced or supplemented by an internet platform to handle these transactions 
some of envoy s competitors in the edi business are beginning to implement such a platform 
if others succeed in implementing an internet platform and are able to gain market acceptance of that platform  whether or not we develop and execute an internet platform  envoy s edi business could be materially adversely affected 
we rely on specific data centers for envoy s edi business envoy s edi business relies on a host computer system to perform real time edi transaction processing 
this host computer system is contained in a single data facility 
the host computer system does not have a remote backup data center 
although the host computer system is insured  if there is a fire or other disaster at the data facility  envoy s edi business could be materially adversely affected 
envoy s edi business also relies on a data center operated by a third party to perform many of envoy s other healthcare edi transaction processing services 
the facility is located in tampa  florida and is operated by gte data services incorporated  with whom envoy has contracted for such processing services 
envoy s edi business relies primarily on this facility to process batch claims and other medical edi transaction sets 
envoy s contract with gte requires gte to maintain continuous processing capability and a hot site disaster recovery system 
this contract expires in december if the gte facility s services are disrupted or delayed  envoy s edi business could be materially adversely affected 
we cannot predict the need for independent healthcare edi processing envoy s edi business strategy anticipates that providers of healthcare services and payors will increase their use of electronic processing of healthcare transactions in the future 
the development of the business of electronically transmitting healthcare transactions is affected  and somewhat hindered  by the complex nature and types of transactions that must be processed 
furthermore  while the wide variety of processing forms used by different payors has fostered the need for healthcare edi and transaction processing clearinghouses such as envoy to date  if such forms become standardized  through consolidation of payors or otherwise  then the need for independent third party healthcare edi processing could become less prevalent 
we cannot assure you that the electronic processing of healthcare transactions will increase or that envoy s edi business will grow 
direct links may bypass need for envoy s edi services some third party payors provide electronic data transmission systems to healthcare providers  thereby directly linking the payor to the provider 
these direct links bypass third party processors like us 
an increase in the use of direct links between payors and providers would materially adversely affect envoy s edi business 
increased competition in the healthcare edi business could adversely impact our results increased competition in the healthcare edi and transaction processing business could force envoy to reduce  or even eliminate  per transaction fees  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
edi services face different types of competition  any or all of which could affect envoy s edi business 
some of envoy s competitors are similarly specialized  such as its former regional partners that have direct provider relationships  and others are involved in more highly developed areas of the business 
in addition  some vendors of provider information management systems include or may include  in their offered products  their own electronic transaction processing systems 
if electronic transaction processing becomes the standard method of processing healthcare claims and information  other companies with significant capital resources could enter the industry 
unauthorized access to data centers could adversely affect envoy s edi business unauthorized access to envoy s edi data centers and misappropriation of our proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on envoy s edi business and financial results 
while we believe our current security measures and the security measures used by third parties for which we process or transmit healthcare information are adequate  such unauthorized access or misappropriation could occur
