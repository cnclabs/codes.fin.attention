management of the company believes that ebitda may provide additional information about the company s ability to meet its future requirements for debt service  capital expenditures and working capital 
ebitda is a financial measure commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of a company s profitability or liquidity 
because ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  this measure may vary among companies 
the ebitda data presented above may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies 
the combination as defined herein was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control 
accordingly  as of and for the two years in the period ended december   the consolidated accounts are presented using the historical costs and results of operations of the affiliated entities as if such entities had always been combined 
accordingly the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of edge petroleum corporation  a texas corporation  old edge  and edge joint venture ii the joint venture 
the joint venture interests not owned by old edge is recorded as minority interest 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a review of the company s financial position and results of operations for the periods indicated 
the company s consolidated financial statements and supplementary data and the related notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general overview the company was organized as a delaware corporation in august in connection with the initial public offering the offering and related combination of certain entities that held interests in the joint venture and certain other oil and natural gas properties  herein referred to as the combination 
in a series of combination transactions the company issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock and received in exchange of the ownership interests in the joint venture and certain other oil and natural gas properties 
in march  and contemporaneously with the combination  the company completed the offering of  shares of its common stock generating proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
the company began operations in and until generated exploratory drilling prospects based on d seismic data for sale to other exploration and production companies 
during  as a result of the advent of economic onshore d seismic surveys and the improvement and increased affordability of data interpretation technologies  the company changed its strategy to emphasize exploration based upon the use of d seismic data 
from to  the company reduced its inventory of d based prospects  began limited drilling for its own account and began developing prospects based on d seismic data 
since early  the company has almost exclusively drilled prospects generated from d seismic data  while accelerating its drilling activity and increasing its working interests in new project areas primarily in south texas and louisiana 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain general and administrative costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
the company records depletion of its full cost pool using the unit of production method 
investments in unproved properties are not subject to amortization until the proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impaired 
to the extent that capitalized costs subject to amortization in the full cost pool net of depletion  depreciation and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net after tax cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  such excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  an impairment of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties is assessed on a quarterly basis in conjunction with the company s quarterly filings with the commission 
during the years ended december  and no full cost ceiling test write down was necessary 
at december  the company recorded a full cost ceiling test write down of its oil and natural gas properties of approximately million 
due to the instability of oil and natural gas prices  the company has entered into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps and collars for a portion of its oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure from price fluctuations 
while the use of these arrangements limits the benefit to the company of increases in the price of oil and natural gas it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements 
the company s hedging arrangements typically apply to only a portion of its production  providing only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices and limiting potential gains from future increases in prices 
the company accounts for these transactions as hedging activities and  accordingly  gains and losses are included in oil and natural gas revenues during the period the hedged production occurs 
at december  and  the fair value  gain loss  of outstanding hedges was approximately  and  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s revenue  profitability and future rate of growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  and the carrying value of its properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
these prices are dependent upon numerous factors beyond the company s control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
even though oil and natural gas commodity prices have recovered from recent low prices  a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and access to capital  as well as the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that the company may economically produce 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue and production oil and natural gas revenues decreased from million in to million in production volumes for oil increased from  bbls in to  bbls in the increase in oil production increased revenues by approximately  further increased by an increase in average oil prices that increased revenues by approximately  production volumes for natural gas decreased from  mcf in to  mcf in the decrease in natural gas production reduced revenues by approximately million 
a decrease in average natural gas prices reduced revenues by approximately  the overall net decrease in oil and natural gas production was primarily due to a sale of producing oil and natural gas properties effective july  which effectively reduced second half production by approximately  mcfe 
oil and natural gas production was further reduced during by production declines from existing wells offset by production from new gross  net  producing exploratory and development wells drilled and completed since december  included within natural gas revenues for the two years ended december  and was approximately million and  respectively  representing net losses and net gains from hedging activity 
the hedging settlements decreased the effective average natural gas prices by per mcf for the year ended december  and increased the effective average natural gas prices by per mcf for the year ended december  the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and operating revenues for the company s oil and natural gas operations for the years ended december  and period compared to period december  increase increase decrease decrease production volumes oil and condensate bbls    natural gas mcf    natural gas equivalents mcfe    average sales prices oil and condensate per bbl natural gas per mcf natural gas equivalent per mcfe operating revenues oil and condensate    natural gas    total    costs and operating expenses oil and natural gas operating expenses  including production and ad valorem taxes  decreased from million in to million in oil and natural gas operating expenses  including production and ad valorem taxes  on a unit of production basis were per mcfe and per mcfe for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in per unit costs reflects an intensive monitoring of field level costs plus the addition of several high volume low cost wells to the production stream during depletion  depreciation and amortization expense dd a decreased from million in to million in included within dd a for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  representing depletion expense of oil and natural gas properties 
an decrease in the overall depletion rate decreased depletion expense by approximately million 
the decrease in the depletion rate was primarily due to a full cost ceiling test write down of oil and natural gas properties of approximately million at december  offset by the abandonment of certain properties during the fourth quarter of decreased oil and natural gas production further decreased depletion expense by approximately  depletion on a unit of production basis for the years ended december  and was per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
the remaining decrease in dd a was due primarily to the amortization of deferred loan costs on the revolving credit facility  which were fully amortized at march  the securities and exchange commission requires that the carrying cost of proved reserves be assessed periodically for ceiling test impairment 
at december   as a result of the company s carrying cost of proved reserves being in excess of the present value using a discount rate of  the company recorded a full cost ceiling test write down of its oil and natural gas properties of approximately million 
at december   no ceiling test write down was necessary

excluding the reduction of g a attributable to overhead reimbursements  g a decreased by approximately  due primarily to lower costs of outside professional services  discontinuing of international new business development and a company wide focus on cost reduction 
general and administrative expenses on a unit of production basis for the years ended december  and were per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
the increase in g a on a per unit of production basis was due to lower production volumes during which were largely attributable to the mid year sale of proved producing properties referred to above

qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
the company uses a revolving credit facility  which has a floating interest rate  to finance a portion of its operations 
the company is not subject to fair value risk resulting from changes in its floating interest rates 
the use of floating rate debt instruments provide a benefit due to downward interest rate movements but does not limit the company to exposure from future increases in interest rates 
based on the year end december  floating interest rate of  a change in interest rate would result in an increase or decrease of interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
in the normal course of business the company enters into hedging transactions  including commodity price collars and swaps  to mitigate its exposure to commodity price movements  but not for trading or speculative purposes 
during december  due to the instability of oil prices and to achieve a more predictable cash flow  the company has put in place a fixed price oil swap for a portion of its year oil and condensate production 
while the use of these arrangements limits the benefit to the company of increases in the price of oil and natural gas it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements 
the number of barrels of oil per day bod and the related fixed price subject to the oil price swap are as follows i january  march   bod  swap at  ii april  june   bod  swap at  iii july  september   bod  swap at  and iv october  december   bod  swap at 
at december   the fair value of the outstanding hedge was approximately  a change in the oil price per barrel would cause the total fair value of the swap to increase or decrease by approximately  subsequent to december   the company entered into three natural gas collars 
the natural gas collars cover the following mmbtu per day and floor and ceiling per mmbtu prices i february  february    mmbtu per day  floor ceiling  ii march  april    mmbtu per day  floor ceiling and iii may  september    mmbtu per day  floor ceiling
