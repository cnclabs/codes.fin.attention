the company operates on a worldwide basis and its results may be adversely or positively affected by fluctuations of various foreign currencies against the us dollar  specifically  the canadian dollar  german mark  british pound sterling  french franc and japanese yen 
each of the company s foreign subsidiaries purchases its inventories in us dollars and has the majority of its sales in us dollars 
accordingly  the us dollar is the functional currency 
certain sales to customers and purchases of certain components to manufacture cameras are made in local currency including japanese yen  thereby creating an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the translation from the applicable currencies to us dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period

the company has been advised that the prc s state tax bureau is reviewing the applicability of those statutes for processing activities of the type engaged in by the company  but it has not yet announced any final decisions as to the taxability of those activities

in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets  management evaluated whether it is more likely than not that some portion  or all of its deferred tax assets  will be realized 
the realization of its deferred tax assets relates directly to the company s ability to generate taxable income for us federal and state tax purposes 
the valuation allowance is then adjusted accordingly 
as of july   based on all the available evidence  management determined that it is more likely than not its deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
accordingly  the valuation allowance was reversed in full and  was recognized as a deferred tax asset at july  and a corresponding deferred tax benefit was also recognized in fiscal the company recognized a net income tax benefit of  for fiscal  of which approximately  related to current tax expense for foreign operations

the company has purchased a total of  shares of its common stock in open market transactions 
future cash commitments 
management believes that anticipated cash flow from operations  amounts available under its credit facilities and the proceeds from future securities offerings will be sufficient to fund its operating cash needs for the foreseeable future 
the company is evaluating various growth opportunities which could require significant funding commitments 
we have from time to time held  and continue to hold  discussions and negotiations with i companies that represent potential acquisition or investment opportunities  ii potential strategic and financial investors who have expressed an interest in making an investment in or acquiring the company  iii potential joint venture partners looking toward formation of strategic alliances that would broaden the company s product base or enable the company to enter new lines of business and iv potential new and existing oem customers where the design  development and production of new products including certain new technologies would enable the company to expand its existing business  and enter new markets outside its traditional business including new ventures focusing on wireless connectivity and other new communication technologies 
there can be no assurance any definitive agreement will be reached regarding any of the foregoing  nor does management believe such agreements are necessary for successful implementation of the company s strategic plans 
risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before you purchase any of our common stock 
these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face 
unknown additional risks and uncertainties  or ones that we currently consider immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
our operations are subject to control by the people s republic of china prc and various of its local governmental agencies 
the continuing viability of our prc agreements is crucial to our business operations in the prc 
we manufacture a majority of the components used in our cameras and assemble all of our manufactured finished products in the prc 
our agreements with various prc government agencies currently provide us with approximately  workers 
we are responsible for their wages  food and housing 
the termination or material modification of these agreements would have a material adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
political and economic uncertainties in the prc could affect our business 
our business could be adversely affected by the imposition in the prc of austerity measures intended to reduce inflation  which could result in the inadequate development or maintenance of infrastructure  the unavailability of adequate power and water supplies  transportation  raw material and parts  or a deterioration of the general political  economic or social environment in the prc 
relocation time and expenses could result in substantial losses 
if we determine it is necessary to relocate our manufacturing facilities from the prc  due to confiscation  expropriation  nationalization  embargoes  or other governmental restrictions  we would incur substantial operating and capital losses including losses resulting from business interruption and delays in production 
in addition  as a result of a relocation of our manufacturing equipment and other assets  we would likely incur relatively higher manufacturing costs  which could reduce sales and decrease the current margin on the products we previously manufactured in the prc 
relocation of our manufacturing operations would also result in disruption in the delivery of our products which could  in turn  reduce demand for such products in the future 
there is also a risk of business interruption as a result of political events  the costs of which may exceed our insurance coverage 
the prc has experienced political disruptions in the past 
we maintain political risk insurance up to million on equipment and business interruption insurance up to million  but it is possible that political events may cause an interruption of our manufacturing operations  the cost of which might exceed our insurance coverage 
a change in the prc s trade status could affect the import cost of our products 
the prc enjoys most favored nation trading status granted by the united states  whereby the united states imposes the lowest applicable tariffs on exports to the united states 
the united states annually reconsiders the renewal of most favored nation trading status for the prc 
pending approval by the senate  a bill recently adopted by the house of representatives would establish permanent normal trade relations with the prc 
if permanent normal trade relations were not established and the prc s most favored nation status were rescinded  there would be a substantial increase in tariffs imposed on goods of chinese origin entering the united states  including those goods manufactured by us  which would have a material adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
termination of our non exclusive license to use certain fuji intellectual property would have a material adverse effect on our single use camera business if fuji s patents were found to be valid and infringed by our single use products 
on december   we commenced an action against fuji photo film co 
ltd 
fuji in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the action seeks to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement between us and fuji and to restrain fuji from terminating the settlement agreement 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we were granted a worldwide subject to certain geographic limitations  non exclusive license to use certain fuji intellectual property in connection with the manufacture and sale of single use cameras 
termination of the license would have a material adverse effect on our single use camera business if fuji patents were found to be valid and infringed by our single use products 
on january   the court granted our request for an order restraining fuji from terminating the settlement agreement 
pending a final judicial determination of the dispute  the restraining order will continue in effect as long as we refrain from making any further shipments under the purchase order that gave rise to the dispute 
see legal proceedings 
we are dependent on certain large oem customers 
our three largest oem customers  agfa  kodak and polaroid  represented approximately of our revenue during fiscal the loss of any of these oem customers could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profits 
a reversal of the international trade commission ban on importation of re loaded single use cameras could adversely affect our business 
in june  the international trade commission banned the unlicensed importation of new and reloaded single use cameras due to the infringement of such imports on existing united states patents held by fuji 
this decision has been appealed to the court of appeals for the district of columbia 
if the decision is reversed  and the united states market for imported remanufactured single use cameras becomes open to competition  it could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
we are dependent on a small group of key personnel 
our business is managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel 
in particular  we rely on the continued services of ira b 
lampert  our chairman  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of any of these key employees could have a material adverse impact on our business 
we believe our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract highly skilled and qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we may not be able to hire the necessary personnel to implement our business strategy  or we may need to pay higher compensation for employees than currently budgeted 
our inability to attract and retain such personnel could limit our growth and affect our profits 
our newer digital camera products involve a more complex development process which we may not be able to successfully integrate into our operations 
digital cameras involve a more complex development process and component procurement than our existing camera business 
manufacturing delays  including component procurement delays which may be outside our control  could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
to achieve our operating and financial objectives  we must manage our anticipated growth effectively 
our business has grown rapidly  and our future success depends in large part on our ability to manage our recent and anticipated growth 
to manage this growth  we will need to hire additional experienced  skilled personnel and to train  manage and retain key employees 
these activities may strain our management resources 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our profits would be adversely affected 
the camera and photographic products industry is highly competitive 
as a manufacturer and distributor of low cost image capture products  we encounter substantial competition from a number of firms  many of which have longer operating histories  more established markets  more extensive facilities and  in some cases  greater resources 
we face certain foreign currency risks as a result of conducting a substantial portion of our business activities in hong kong 
since the hong kong dollar has been pegged to the united states dollar  but the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar may fluctuate in the future 
although our oem and major retail business is conducted in us dollars  certain of our obligations under agreements in the prc  as well as our hong kong suppliers  are paid in hong kong dollars 
we are also exposed to currency risks in japan and other countries where we purchase materials for our products or sell those products 
we generally do not engage in currency hedging activities 
we also face political risks as a result of conducting administrative  sales  engineering and design activities in hong kong 
in july  the exercise of sovereignty over hong kong was transferred from the united kingdom to the prc and hong kong became a special administrative region of the prc 
we cannot predict how the prc will interpret and implement the basic law that provides  in part  for the capitalist system and way of life to remain unchanged for years 
we can also not predict the effect of any such action on our business activities in hong kong or our operations or financial condition in general 
any significant changes affecting our operations or financial condition in the prc or hong kong could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
the importation of products into the united states and other countries in which our products are sold is subject to various other risks 
the united states  the prc  hong kong  the european union or other countries may impose trade restrictions that could adversely affect our operations 
in addition  the united states is currently monitoring various prc practices  including trade  investment and government procurement  as well as the prc s compliance with various multilateral and bilateral agreements 
we cannot predict whether the united states will take future trade actions against the prc that may result in increased tariffs against prc products  including products imported by us 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate 
the stock markets  and in particular the nasdaq national market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
many stocks are trading at or near historical highs and reflect price to earnings ratios substantially above historical levels that may not be sustained 
these broad market factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
future sales of our common stock could adversely affect the price of the common stock 
future sales of our common stock could depress the market price of the shares 
future sales of these shares or the market s perception that any sales could occur may cause the market price of the common stock to fall 
such sales might also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future equity offerings or to use equity as consideration for future acquisitions 
we may not be able to identify and integrate future acquisitions 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions we consider reasonable in light of the revenues and profits we believe we will be able to generate from these acquisitions 
the cost of acquisitions within the industry has generally increased over time 
additionally  we compete for acquisitions with certain other industry competitors  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
increased demand for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition prices 
although we believe opportunities may exist for us to grow through acquisitions  we may not be able to identify and consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms 
if we do acquire other companies  we may not be able to profitably manage and successfully integrate them with our operations and sales and marketing efforts without substantial costs or delays 
acquisitions involve a number of potential risks  including the potential loss of customers  increased leverage and debt service requirements  combining disparate company cultures and facilities and operating in geographically diverse markets 
one or more of our future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we  as a result of our global operating and financial activities  are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we manage exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financing activities 
our hedging activities were immaterial and as of july  there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding 
we continue to analyze the benefits and costs associated with hedging against foreign currency fluctuations 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our investing and borrowing activities used to meet our liquidity needs 
long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments  while short term debt is used to meet working capital requirements 
derivative instruments are not presently used to adjust our interest rate risk profile 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments
