item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in connection with millipore s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k report 
results of operations the company reported a profit per share of and for and  respectively  compared to a loss of per share for excluding unusual items  the company would have reported diluted earnings per share of  and for  and  respectively 
the company initiated a restructuring program in to streamline worldwide operations and reduce the overall cost structure 
this program is discussed in its entirety in restructuring items 
reference is also made to the discussion of gross margins  gain on sale of equity securities  acquisitions and legal proceedings below for additional information related to the other unusual items on the following schedule 
summary of unusual items year ended december  in millions  except per share data cost of sales write off of inventory and manufacturing equipment provision for excess and obsolete inventory purchase accounting adjustment impact on gross margin operating expenses purchased research and development expenses restructuring items litigation settlements income loss before income taxes gain on sale of equity securities impact on income loss before income taxes tax impact of unusual items net income loss from unusual items net income loss per share from unusual items local currency results the following discussion of net sales  gross profit margins and operating expenses refers to revenue  margins and expenses in local currencies 
local currency results represent the foreign currency balances translated  in all periods presented  at millipore s budgeted exchange rates  thus excluding the impact of fluctuations in the actual foreign currency rates 
the company s management uses this presentation for internal evaluation of the financial performance of the company s business segments because it believes that the local currency results provide a clearer presentation of the underlying business trends 
the us dollar results represent the foreign currency balances translated at actual exchange rates 
net sales net sales  measured in us dollars  increased percent in  compared to a decrease of percent in the net sales increase in as compared to was primarily due to the beginning of a recovery in the semiconductor industry coupled with continued growth in the biopharmaceutical business and positive net currency effects 
growth in the americas and asia pacific regions was heavily influenced by the improvements in the semiconductor industry 
the net sales decrease in compared to was primarily due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry  economic difficulties in asian markets and negative currency effects 
during as compared to the japanese yen strengthened against the us dollar by approximately percent and the euro weakened against the us dollar by approximately percent 
the positive effect from the stronger yen more than offset the decline in the euro resulting in an increase in reported sales growth by percentage points over the preceding year 
in the reported sales growth was negatively impacted by percent as a result of the japanese yen which weakened against the us dollar by approximately percent  as did the european currencies  although to a lesser extent 
as a general matter  a stronger us dollar will adversely affect the sales growth of both business segments 
however  since the microelectronics segment has a higher percentage of sales in asia  strengthening of the dollar against asian currencies will have a somewhat larger impact on that segment 
similarly  the biopharmaceutical research segment has a higher percentage of sales in europe than the microelectronics segment 
therefore  strengthening of the dollar against the european currencies will have a larger impact on the biopharmaceutical research segment sales growth 
non currency related price changes have not significantly affected the comparability of sales during the past three years 
sales growth by business segment and geography  measured in local currencies and us dollars  is summarized in the table below 
sales growth sales growth in local in us currencies dollars biopharmaceutical research microelectronics consolidated americas europe asia pacific consolidated biopharmaceutical research sales  measured in local currencies  increased percent in compared to the growth was broad based across product lines and geographies 
sales growth was strongest for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets utilizing laboratory research applications  water filtration devices and consumable filtration products and systems used in drug production 
revenue growth from the sale of process systems was positive  although to a lesser extent than other product lines 
however  the order pattern for process systems is variable and large orders are received on a periodic basis which may positively or negatively impact growth comparisons 
the growth for this segment was positively impacted in by the increase in new drugs approved and in production 
biopharmaceutical research sales  measured in local currencies  increased percent in compared to the growth of the biopharmaceutical research segment in reflected the combination of increased demand for consumable products and process equipment used in the production of sterile drugs and analytical and water filtration devices used in research laboratories 
the growth in the americas and europe for this segment was attributed to an increase in the number of new drugs approved and in production 
this segment was adversely affected in asia by a decrease in demand as a result of region wide recessionary pressures 
microelectronics segment sales growth measured in local currency increased percent in compared to during  the company s sales growth has been positively impacted by improvements in the semiconductor industry and strengthening of the asian economies 
recent industry results and published reports indicate a reduction in excess capacity in the semiconductor industry and increase in overall semiconductor demand which generally signals an upturn in this market 
sales growth for this segment was positive in the asia pacific region and  to a lesser extent  the americas region offset by a decline in sales in europe 
microelectronics segment sales growth  measured in local currency  decreased percent in as compared to the decrease in sales was directly attributable to the continuation of the semiconductor industry slump  which began in the middle of the reduction in equipment sales from the microelectronics segment was the result of a decrease in new plant construction and upgrades 
sales of consumable purification devices also declined although to a lesser extent  consistent with lower worldwide semiconductor plant capacity utilization 
gross profit margins gross profit margins in local currencies were percent in  percent in  and percent in excluding unusual items  gross profit margins in were percent and percent in the unusual items recorded in were a million charge for the write off of inventory and manufacturing equipment associated with product line rationalization activities and a provision of million for excess and obsolete inventory 
the unusual item recorded in was the effect of an inventory write up to net realizable value of million related to acquisition accounting for tylan general inc tylan 
gross profit margin percentages were higher in than those in as a result of company wide increased volume as well as savings realized from the restructuring initiatives which began in the third quarter of gross profit margin percentages were lower in as compared to  excluding the unusual items recorded in both years  reflecting the impact of significantly reduced volumes in the company s manufacturing plants serving the microelectronics segment combined with duplicative manufacturing costs resulting from concurrent operations at three existing plants located in california and texas and operations at the new manufacturing facility in allen  texas 
the redundant facilities were closed in september and their operations consolidated into the allen  texas facility 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses in local currencies increased percent in and decreased percent in the increase in compared to was primarily attributable to million of incremental variable employee compensation earned in over amounts earned in the preceding year 
the decrease in compared to was due to cost containment programs initiated as part of the restructuring activities and reductions in employee compensation programs due to the financial performance of the company in that year 
the company continues to invest in sales  service and marketing resources focused on maintaining or improving customer services  supporting the launch of new products and development of future sales initiatives aimed at improving the company s competitive positions 
as a percentage of sales s  g a expenses decreased slightly in as compared to and increased percent in as compared to research and development expenses in local currencies decreased percent in and percent in the decreases in and were primarily due to the elimination of research and development expenses for non strategic product lines in the microelectronics segment and the microelectronics consolidation into the allen  texas facility thus eliminating duplicate operations 
litigation settlements totaling million were recorded in the first quarter of and are described under legal proceedings below 
restructuring items in the second quarter of  the company announced a restructuring program to improve the competitive position of the company by streamlining worldwide operations and reducing the overall cost structure 
the restructuring program was initiated to bring operating costs in line with lower revenues resulting from the financial difficulties in asian economies  the strong us dollar and the continuation of the semiconductor industry slump 
the combination of the restructuring programs and the microelectronics plant consolidation resulted in estimated savings of approximately million in the savings resulted from reduced wages  facility related costs  depreciation and amortization and were primarily reflected as reductions in cost of sales 
key initiatives of the restructuring program included discontinue non strategic product lines and rationalize product offerings to improve product line focus 
the non strategic product lines consisted of high pressure liquid chromatography equipment  semiconductor fab monitoring and control software and various filtration devices 
the rationalization of product offerings was a result of management s review which identified specific products with limited profitability or products which were inconsistent with current strategic marketing plans  such as non standard products 
these actions to improve product line focus were completed by september  consolidate certain manufacturing operations to eliminate duplicate manufacturing processes 
identified manufacturing operations in ireland and the us are in the process of being consolidated into existing facilities within the company  which will result in similar production activities occurring at the same location 
the consolidation of manufacturing operations will be completed in realign european country organizational structure to focus on operating business units and establish a regional transaction service center  resulting in the consolidation of financial and administrative activities into a single location 
the company completed the transition to the service center during reduce administrative and management infrastructure costs in asia 
these cost reductions resulted in a lower overhead structure for administrative and management infrastructure in asia and were achieved through reduced facility costs and administrative positions as offices in the region were consolidated during renegotiate marketing  research and development and supply agreements 
these agreements were amended to eliminate the cost of maintaining certain exclusivity rights and to reduce purchasing commitments for non strategic products 
these actions were completed during streamline the supply chain management function through the centralization of worldwide procurement functions and the consolidation of vendors to significantly reduce the aggregate number of vendors  resulting in cost savings and shorter cycle time within the procurement function as well as materials cost reductions 
these actions were completed during in the third quarter of  the company recorded an expense associated with these activities of million million after tax including a restructuring charge of million and a million charge for inventory and million of fixed asset write offs against cost of sales 
the million restructuring charge included million of employee severance costs  million write off of real and intangible assets associated with discontinued product lines and with the termination of certain rights under two technology development collaboration agreements  million of lease cancellation costs and million of contract termination costs 
during  approximately million of restructuring costs  consisting primarily of severance  were paid 
the company reevaluated the accrual for the restructuring program and in the third quarter of reversed million of the remaining balance 
the reversal reflects a lower estimate for employee severance and lease cancellation costs 
although the planned number of employee positions had been eliminated  the reduction in severance cost is attributed to higher levels of attrition than originally anticipated and to impacted employees filling open positions as demand increased due to improved sales volume 
at december   approximately million remains accrued and will be substantially paid in the restructuring initiatives combined with the consolidation of the company s microelectronics plants resulted in the elimination of positions worldwide 
notification to employees was completed in the third quarter of  however a small number of these employees will continue in their existing positions through with their related salary costs charged to operations as incurred 
under the terms of the severance agreements  the company expects to pay severance and associated benefits through during the third quarter of  the company also recorded in cost of sales an incremental provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million in response to adverse changes in demand attributable to declining business conditions in asia and the slowdown in the semiconductor industry 
gain on sale of equity securities the gain on sale of equity securities in primarily reflects the sale of the company s equity holdings in perseptive biosystems 
as of december   the company held million shares of perseptive biosystems common stock and  shares of perseptive biosystems preferred stock 
on january   perseptive merged with the perkin elmer corporation 
pursuant to the merger  all of the company s holdings of common and preferred shares in perseptive were converted into an aggregate of  shares of perkin elmer common stock 
in the first quarter of  the company sold all of its shares of perkin elmer stock for approximately million in cash 
the company also sold all of its common shares of glyko biomedical ltd 
in the first quarter of and recognized a gain of million 
gain on sale of equity securities in reflected the sale of a portion of the company s holdings in perseptive biosystems common shares 
net interest expense net interest expense in was million more than this increase is attributed to higher average interest rates resulting from the renegotiation of the company s revolving credit agreement and higher effective interest due to the impact of foreign exchange under the yen debt swap agreements which was somewhat offset by lower average borrowings 
net interest expense in was million less than  primarily as a result of the yen debt swap agreement entered into during december provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate in  and was percent  excluding the effect of the restructuring items recorded in and and the non tax deductible write off of purchased research and development associated with the tylan acquisition in earnings per share earnings per share in were impacted by the reversal of the restructuring charges 
earnings per share in were impacted by restructuring charges and several unusual items and earnings per share included write offs of purchased research and development associated with the company s acquisition of tylan 
the impact of these items is reflected in the summary of unusual items on page above 
additionally  in as compared to  earnings per share were positively impacted by per share as a result of the net currency impact of the stronger japanese yen offset by the weaker european currencies 
earnings per share were adversely impacted in by the comparatively stronger us dollar  reducing earnings by per share as compared to acquisitions on january   the company completed its cash tender offer for all of the outstanding common shares of tylan general  inc tylan for per share 
tylan became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company on january  the aggregate purchase price was million  plus the assumption of tylan s outstanding debt  net of cash  totaling million 
this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in a write off for in process research and development ipr d of million in the first quarter of included in the ipr d write off were two major ipr d projects acquired as a part of tylan 
the first of these was a project to develop intracavity laser spectroscopy technologies for application in semiconductor and related industries 
this project had an estimated fair value of million  was expected to require the investment of an additional million and twenty two man years to complete generally  the company regards  hours as comprising one man year 
if proven to be technologically feasible  it was expected that this project would yield a break through enabling technology and would become a major revenue source for the company 
the products expected to result from this project were to be used in monitoring moisture and other contaminant levels within vacuum deposition chambers for semiconductor manufacturing 
the valuable element of this project was that the expected future products would be differentiated from tylan s current products  would offer enhanced sensitivity and the ability to monitor corrosive gas streams and would also have applications for different target gases and sample environments 
while tylan retained management direction over this project  development was performed by a third party pursuant to a development and license agreement 
under this development and license agreement tylan directed the research with the objective of developing intracavity laser spectroscopy technologies for application in semiconductor  flat panel  and fiber optic manufacturing industries 
according to this agreement  tylan was to have the rights and responsibilities to utilize the technology  were it to be successfully developed  and to manufacture products for sale to the above industries 
this agreement provided for aggregate development fees of million  payable million at signing and the balance in equal quarterly installments thereafter over the five year term of the agreement 
the agreement was terminable at will by tylan but required the payment of a termination fee equal to six quarters of development fees million 
development fees were charged against research and development expense 
this project was written off because  at the time of the tylan acquisition  it was very early in the development process and had not achieved technological feasibility 
there was also significant uncertainty as to the precise configuration and market requirements of the expected products based on the intracavity laser spectroscopy technology 
in addition  there was considerable uncertainty as to how long it would take to develop a commercializable product from this technology 
further  technological feasibility for potential alternative future uses of this technology had not been achieved 
as a result of the prolonged downturn in the microelectronics industry  the company reprioritized research and development programs and further development of this project was suspended in late this resulted in a decision to terminate the third party development and license agreement in december and the termination fee was charged to the acquisition reserve 
the company retains certain post termination residual rights to this technology and is currently re evaluating the future of this project 
the second significant ipr d project acquired with tylan which has been written off was the development of a new more versatile  sensitive and easily manufactured transducer based on thin film technology 
this project had an estimated fair value of million  was expected to require the investment of an additional million and ten man years to complete and was anticipated to generate significant revenues over the estimated life of the resulting products 
if proven technologically feasible  the valuable element of this project was that it was expected to generate a transducer which was superior to current transducers in that it could operate in both high and low pressure environments with enhanced sensitivity and would be easier and less expensive to manufacture 
this project was written off because  as of the date of the tylan acquisition  it was unknown whether or not the thin film transducer technology could be manufactured successfully on a large scale 
significant issues relating to manufacturability and whether product physical dimensions and other product criteria could be achieved remained to be resolved 
in addition  there was uncertainty concerning customer acceptance of this product 
further  the technology underlying this project had no alternative future uses not included in its estimated fair value within the markets served by the company 
this project successfully achieved technological feasibility and yielded one commercializable product which was launched during however  the objective of ease and cost effectiveness to manufacture continues to be a challenge 
accordingly  the current revenue projection for the resulting products is approximately one third of the original estimate 
the estimated cost to complete this project is currently expected to be less than one half of the original estimate 
in addition  to the foregoing ipr d projects  the tylan acquisition included eight other ipr d projects with an aggregate value of million  not considered to be individually significant and which were expected to cost an aggregate of million and twenty nine man years to complete 
these projects were written off because technological feasibility had not been demonstrated as of the date of the acquisition of tylan 
as of december   three of these eight projects have been completed  two have been cancelled  one is ongoing  one has had a major change in its scope and has been integrated into a post acquisition project and one has been suspended 
as of december   an aggregate of million had been invested on these individually insignificant tylan ipr d projects and it was estimated that an additional million would be required to achieve technological feasibility for the one ongoing project 
the reasons for the aggregate increase in investment in these insignificant ipr d projects included the change in the direction of three of these ipr d projects to adapt to the evolving needs of the target customer base  the unanticipated technical complexity in adapting promising miniaturization technologies from other industries to tylan product applications and the expansion of the scope of certain of these projects since the date of the tylan acquisition 
on may   the company acquired all outstanding shares of bioprocessing corporation limited bioprocessing in exchange for  shares of millipore common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the consolidated financial statements for prior periods were not restated because the addition of bioprocessing did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
bioprocessing develops  manufactures and sells a wide range of proprietary products and services for the chromatographic purification of proteins 
market risk the company is exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured both against the us dollar and each other 
the company manages these market risks through its normal financing and operating activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not invest in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
foreign exchange the company derives approximately percent of its revenues from customers outside of the americas 
this business is transacted through the company s network of international subsidiaries generally in the local currency 
this exposes the company to risks associated with changes in foreign currency that can impact revenues  net income and cash flow 
approximately of the company s sales are derived from europe where the us dollar strengthened against the euro during continued strengthening of the us dollar against the euro may negatively impact the results of operations of the company 
the company is able to partially mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the euro by active management of cross border currency flows and material sourcing 
the company has significant exposure against the japanese yen which strengthened against the us dollar in generally  a stronger yen has a positive impact on results of operations 
the company is exposed to changes in the japanese yen that can not be mitigated through normal financing or operating activities 
accordingly  the net equity exposure risk is managed through the use of debt swap agreements 
historically  the company entered into foreign currency option contracts to sell yen on a continuing basis in amounts and timing consistent with the underlying currency transactions 
this program was discontinued in the gains on these transactions  if any  partially offset the realized foreign exchange losses on the underlying exposure 
in and  gains  net of premium costs  of million and million  respectively were realized from these contracts and were recorded in cost of sales 
at december   the company had open option contracts to sell yen aggregating million 
all open options expire within months 
premiums to purchase foreign currency option contracts are amortized over the life of the contract 
the company s net equity exposure to the japanese yen has been hedged through debt swap agreements covering both principal and interest 
pursuant to these agreements  of debt with a weighted average fixed interest rate of percent was swapped for an equivalent value of yen at a weighted average exchange rate of yen to the dollar and a weighted average fixed interest rate of percent 
the swap agreements mature in and see capital resources and liquidity below for a discussion of cash collateralization requirements under these agreements 
although the company manages its foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities  when the us dollar strengthens against the basket of currencies in which the company transacts its business  generally sales and net income will be adversely impacted 
credit risk the company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables and derivative financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents are placed with major financial institutions with high quality credit ratings 
the amount placed with any one institution is limited by policy 
trade receivables credit risk exposure is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographies 
the company is exposed to credit related risks associated with the potential nonperformance by counterparties to the debt swap agreements 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
the company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and limits the amount of contracts it enters into with any one party 
capital resources and liquidity cash flow provided from operations was million in  million in and million in reported cash flow from operations was reduced by million in  million in and million in for costs associated with the restructuring program and the integration of acquisitions made during and excluding the restructuring and acquisition related expenditures  cash flow from operations was million in  million in and million in the increase in cash flow from operations in over  excluding the restructuring and acquisition expenditures  is primarily a result of improved income from operations  increases in accounts payable due to higher revenues in the fourth quarter of  accrued expenses primarily resulting from variable compensation programs and continued asset management initiatives launched in partially offsetting this is an increase in account receivables resulting from significantly higher sales volume in the second half of combined with the increased revenues in geographies with traditionally longer payment cycles 
this has resulted in days sales outstanding in accounts receivable increasing from days in to days in the company continues to aggressively manage its collection activities and does not anticipate increased collections risk 
the improvement in cash flow from operations over  excluding the restructuring and acquisition related expenditures  is the result of a decrease in working capital offset by a significant decline in operating income before restructuring charges and unusual items 
the favorable working capital comparisons were a combination of a decrease in accounts receivable balances  lower inventory levels and a reduction in other current assets 
the improvement in receivables reflects the impact of the lower sales volume and improved collection experience 
the improvement in inventory utilization was attributable to asset management initiatives launched in and reserve actions taken as part of the restructuring program 
the reduction in other current assets reflects the sale of equity securities in the decline in operating income resulted from the downturn in the semiconductor industry  the financial difficulties in asia and the strength of the us dollar 
during the company expects to spend approximately million in cash for costs accrued in connection with the restructuring program and for costs to complete the integration of acquisitions acquired in and this will be funded by cash flow from operating activities 
cash generated by the company during was used to reduce short term debt  to invest in property  plant and equipment and to pay dividends 
property  plant and equipment expenditures for were less than expenditures by million primarily due expenditures in of million for the expansion of the biopharmaceutical membrane manufacturing facility in cork  ireland and million for the construction of the new microelectronics manufacturing facility in allen  texas 
this decrease was offset in part by million for expenditures made in to complete the membrane manufacturing facility 
the company expects capital expenditures for to be in the range of to million 
depreciation expense in is expected to be slightly higher than in as a result of the increased capital expenditures in the company has no significant commitments for capital expenditures at december  the company also received million in cash for the sale of securities in waters corporation 
cash generated by the company during was used to invest in property  plant and equipment  and to pay dividends 
property  plant and equipment expenditures for exceeded expenditures by million primarily due to million spent for the expansion of the biopharmaceutical membrane manufacturing facility in cork  ireland and million spent for the construction of the new microelectronics manufacturing facility in allen  texas 
the total cost of the allen facility was approximately million 
in  cash generated from operating activities  along with increased borrowings  was used for the acquisition of tylan  the purchase of certain other assets and technology and capital expenditures 
during the company continued to invest in capacity expansions and the upgrade of manufacturing facilities and in information technology systems and equipment 
the company maintains an unsecured revolving credit agreement  dated january   with a consortium of commercial banks the credit agreement which currently makes million available to the company 
during the company reduced its borrowings under the credit agreement by million so that  at december   the company had additional borrowing capacity thereunder of million 
the credit agreement was renegotiated during to waive defaults under certain financial covenants relating to operating cash flow and interest coverage and to permit less restrictive operating cash flow and interest coverage covenants for and a portion of the company also agreed to an additional minimum earnings covenant as well as to increases in both the interest rate and the facility fees 
as renegotiated  interest is payable under the credit agreement at a floating us dollar deposit rate  defined as libor  plus a margin in the range of to percent 
the company also has an additional million of other short term borrowing capacity available of which million was outstanding at december in november moody s investor services and standard poors corporation graded the company s debt at a rating of ba and bb  respectively 
both ratings are characterized as below investment grade 
the company expects that these ratings may make it more difficult for the company to access money markets should it become necessary to do so 
in addition  the foregoing debt ratings coupled with the strengthening of the japanese yen triggered a requirement to provide cash collateralization under one of the company s yen denominated debt swap agreements in the event that the net value of its position was below the net value of the counterparty s position 
in the event that the company s debt rating improves  these agreements provide for less stringent collateralization requirements 
while this collateralization requirement will not impact the company s foreign exchange exposure  it could impact short term liquidity if there were a serious deterioration in the value of the company s swap position 
the amount of the cash collateral is dependent  among other things  on the exchange rate of the yen to the us dollar  generally  as the yen strengthens  the amount of cash collateral required from the company increases 
at december   this cash collateralization amount was million 
the company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents  funds available under the credit agreement and cash flows expected to be generated by future operating activities will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve to twenty four months 
dividends the quarterly dividend was per share throughout the company paid dividends of million in euro on january   several member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign legacy currencies  and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
as of that date  the euro began trading on currency exchanges and the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  in the first quarter of  the company began invoicing certain customers and intercompany transactions in the euro 
year the company has been aware of the year issue that had the potential to affect products and systems that were not designed to properly handle the transition between the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
the company recognized the need to ensure that its business operations would not be adversely impacted by the year  and it authorized an internal team to assess the company s year readiness  to determine the steps necessary to achieve readiness  and to facilitate the necessary readiness preparations 
through december   the company incurred approximately million in its year assessment and remediation program  and it does not expect to incur any further costs in this program 
prior to the end of  the company completed its readiness assessment and its implementation of all steps that it determined necessary to make the company ready for the year  including its contingency plans for handling anticipated readiness risks 
the company s transition from to occurred without any business disruption 
with the transition into the year complete  the year issue has not had  and the company believes it will not have  a material impact on the company s business  financial conditions or results of operations 
legal proceedings the million settlement of litigation charge taken in related to matters a proceeding arising out of an administrative order issued by the environmental quality board eqb of puerto rico alleging that the company s wholly owned subsidiary failed to properly manage  transport and dispose of nitrocellulose membrane scrap as a hazardous waste  and proposed penalties in the amount of million 
the company settled this proceeding in and recorded a charge of million 
a private lawsuit brought by an intervening party in the eqb administrative case described above  the company recorded a charge of million in the reflecting its costs to settle this suit 
a patent lawsuit with mott metallurgical corporation in which each party claimed infringement of one of its patents by the other 
the company recorded a charge of million in to settle this suit  the parties also agreed to cross license the two patents at issue 
as has been previously disclosed  millipore has  in the past  been named as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of superfund by the us environmental protection agency epa with respect to a release as defined in section of superfund  at twelve sites to which chemical wastes generated by the manufacturing operations of millipore or one of its divisions may have been sent 
the company has settled its liability pursuant to consent decrees releasing millipore from further liability with respect to certain covered matters at all of these superfund sites 
however  as is typical with consent decrees in such superfund proceedings  epa and the relevant state agencies have reserved the right to maintain actions against the settling parties  including the company  in the event certain events occur or do not occur at those sites 
the company does not expect that the conditions in the consent decrees permitting these governmental parties to re open the cases will occur 
in any event  the company believes that the aggregate of any future potential liabilities should not have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations or financial condition in light of the advanced stage of funded remedial action at each site and the likely availability of contribution from numerous other financially solvent prps participating at each such superfund site 
business outlook and uncertainties the following statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
sales the semiconductor industry in which the microelectronics business segment participates is highly cyclical 
the downturn  which began in the middle of  continued into this business segment reported four sequential quarters of increased sales during additionally  recent industry results and published reports indicate that an industry wide growth cycle has begun 
while some published reports suggest that this growth cycle could last for up to three years  there can be no assurance as to the extent and duration of this growth cycle or as to its positive impact on millipore 
the company does anticipate  however  that these industry wide improvements will result in stronger sales growth in the biopharmaceutical research segment has demonstrated relatively stable patterns of revenue growth 
customers in this segment  particularly those involved in the production of sterile drugs  purchase products for use in validated production processes 
accordingly  it is important to participate in the development of new drugs in order to be designed into the ultimate manufacturing process 
adoption of new technologies and products requires a lengthy validation process prior to adoption 
the growth of this segment is highly dependent on the development and approval of new drugs 
it is difficult to ascertain the number or timing of such approvals  however  the number of drugs at various stages in the approval process has increased over the past two years 
the remaining driver of this segment is research and development spending 
recently published industry reports in the area of life science anticipate increased research and development spending 
however the impact on the company is unknown 
during  the company has seen reduced sales growth in the european region  an area which impacts the biopharmaceutical research segment more than the microelectronics segment 
the economic pressures in europe combined with the us dollar strengthening against most european currencies may adversely affect the biopharmaceutical research segment in both of the company s business segments were adversely impacted by the financial difficulties in the asian economies  which began in late and continued through during  this region has shown some recovery  although the economic pressures in europe have offset it 
the continuation of these conditions in europe would moderate the growth rate of both segments 
approximately percent of the company s sales are to customers outside of the americas and are generally made in local currency 
as previously noted  currencies had a net positive impact to both sales and earnings in as compared to this was the composite result of a stronger yen in mostly offset by the weak euro 
since the end of  the dollar has begun to strengthen against the yen and the euro 
therefore  if rates of exchange remain at the march  level  there could be a slight negative impact on sales for the first quarter and full year as compared to gross margins the company expects gross margin percentages in to improve as compared with those of margins will benefit from the impact of increased volume in the company s manufacturing plants to support anticipated sales growth 
somewhat offsetting the increased volume impact will be margin reductions due to sales growth for process systems which traditionally have lower gross margins 
to the extent that foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar remain at march  levels  first quarter and full year margins will not be significantly impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in december the company s sole supplier of a critical raw material used in the manufacture of one type of membrane incorporated into products sold by the biopharmaceutical research business segment advised the company that it would discontinue manufacture of that raw material during the second half of this raw material is also used as a critical component in the production of other widely used industrial products 
millipore products which use this membrane accounted for approximately million in sales 
the company does not currently anticipate difficulty in establishing satisfactory transitional supply arrangements or in establishing alternative sources of supply for this raw material 
however  while the company is diligently pursuing transitional and alternative supply arrangements  there can be no assurance that it will be successful 
operating expenses the company expects that operating expenses in local currencies  as a percentage of sales  in may somewhat improve as compared to the percentage achieved in the previous year 
interest expense the company expects net interest expense in will be slightly lower than as a result of lower average debt 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in is projected to be in the range of percent  consistent with the effective rate for  excluding the effect of restructuring items 
the tax rate estimate is based on the company s current expectations for income and current tax law and  therefore is subject to change 
in addition  since the company s revenues are expected to reflect a higher proportion of income generated by its microelectronics business segment  the products of which are primarily manufactured in the united states  it is anticipated that a trend increasing the effective income tax rate will develop during subsequent years as less revenue is derived from manufacturing sites located in foreign lower tax rate jurisdictions 
further  in the event that the company s cash needs significantly increase above those currently projected and outstrip the resources identified under capital resources and liquidity above  then an additional upward influence on the company s tax rate could develop if the company chose to meet this need by the repatriation of cash indefinitely re invested in foreign operations
