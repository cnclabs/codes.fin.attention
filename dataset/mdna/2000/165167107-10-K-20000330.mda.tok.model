the following table shows the company s production by region for  and for the years ended december  mmcfe percent mmcfe percent mmcfe percent mid continent    gulf coast    canada   all other areas    total production    natural gas production represented approximately of the company s total production volume on an equivalent basis in  compared to in and in for  the company realized an average price per barrel of oil of  compared to in and in gas price realizations fluctuated from an average of per mcf in and in to per mcf in the company s hedging activities resulted in a decrease in oil and gas revenues of million in  an increase in oil and gas revenues of million in  and a decrease in oil and gas revenues of million in oil and gas marketing sales 
the company realized million in oil and gas marketing sales for third parties in  with corresponding oil and gas marketing expenses of million  for a net margin of million 
this compares to sales of million and million  expenses of million and million  and a margin of million and million in and  respectively 
production expenses and taxes 
production expenses and taxes  which include lifting costs  production taxes and ad valorem taxes  were million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
on a unit of production basis  production expenses and taxes were per mcfe in and  and per mcfe in the company expects that lease operating expenses per mcfe will generally remain at current levels throughout  although production taxes will increase as a result of increased oil and gas prices 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
the company utilizes the full cost method to account for its investment in oil and gas properties 
under this method  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves including such costs as leasehold acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenditures  certain capitalized internal costs  dry hole costs and tangible and intangible development costs are capitalized as incurred 
these oil and gas property costs  along with the estimated future capital expenditures to develop proved undeveloped reserves  are depleted and charged to operations using the unit of production method based on the ratio of current production to proved oil and gas reserves as estimated by the company s independent engineering consultants and company engineers 
costs directly associated with the acquisition and evaluation of unproved properties are excluded from the amortization computation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property or whether impairment has occurred 
the excess of capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes  over the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and gas properties is charged to operations 
the company incurred an impairment of oil and gas properties charge of million in no such charge was incurred in the writedown was caused by a combination of several factors  including the acquisitions completed by the company during  which were accounted for using the purchase method  and the significant decreases in oil and gas prices throughout oil and gas prices used to value the company s proved reserves decreased from per bbl of oil and per mcf of gas at december   to per bbl of oil and per mcf of gas at december  higher drilling and completion costs and the evaluation of certain leasehold  seismic and other exploration related costs that were previously unevaluated were the remaining factors which contributed to the writedown in the company incurred an impairment of oil and gas properties charge of million during the writedown in was caused by several factors  including declining oil and gas prices during the year  escalating drilling and completion costs  and poor drilling results primarily in louisiana 
impairment of other assets 
the company incurred a million impairment charge during of this amount  million related to the company s investment in preferred stock of gothic energy corporation  and the remainder was related to certain of the company s gas processing and transportation assets located in louisiana 
no such charge was recorded in or oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of oil and gas properties was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the average dd a rate per mcfe  which is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs  and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented  was in us and in canada  in us and in canada and us only in  and  respectively 
the company expects the dd a rate to be between and per mcfe 
depreciation and amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization d a of other assets was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was caused by increased investments in depreciable buildings and equipment and increased amortization of debt issuance costs as a result of the issuance of senior notes in april general and administrative 
general and administrative g a expenses  which are net of capitalized internal payroll and non payroll expenses see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were million in  million in and million in the decrease in compared to was due primarily to various actions taken to lower corporate overhead  including staff reductions and office closings which occurred in late and early the increase in compared to is due primarily to increased personnel expenses required by the company s growth and industry wage inflation 
the company capitalized million  million and million of internal costs in  and  respectively  directly related to the company s oil and gas exploration and development efforts 
the company anticipates that g a costs for per mcfe will remain at approximately the same level as interest and other income 
interest and other income for was million compared to million in  and million in the increase from to was due primarily to gains on sales of various non core assets during during  the company realized a gain on the sale of its bayard common stock of million  the most significant component of interest and other income 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in is due primarily to a full year of interest on the company s million senior notes 
the increase in compared to was due primarily to the issuance of million of senior notes in april in addition to the interest expense reported  the company capitalized million of interest during  compared to million capitalized in  and million capitalized in the company anticipates that capitalized interest for will be between million and million 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the company recorded income taxes of million in compared to in and an income tax benefit of million in the income tax expense recorded in is related entirely to the company s canadian operations 
at december   the company had a us net operating loss carryforward of approximately million for regular federal income taxes which will expire in future years beginning in management believes that it cannot be demonstrated at this time that it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets  comprised primarily of the net operating loss carryforwards generated for us purposes  will be realizable in future years  and therefore a valuation allowance of million has been recorded 
the company does not expect to record any net income tax expense related to its us operations in based on information available at this time 
liquidity and capital resources years ended december   and cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities inclusive of changes in working capital was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase of million from to was due primarily to increased oil and gas revenues 
the decrease of million from to was due primarily to reduced operating income resulting from significant decreases in average oil and gas prices between periods  as well as significant increases in g a expenses and interest expense 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash used in investing activities decreased to million in  compared to million in and million in during  the company invested million for exploration and development drilling  million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties  and received million related to divestitures of oil and gas properties 
during  million was used to acquire certain oil and gas properties and companies with oil and gas reserves

the company has a million revolving bank credit facility which matures in january  with an initial committed borrowing base of million 
as of december   the company had borrowed million under this facility 
borrowings under the facility are secured by certain producing oil and gas properties and bear interest at a variable rate  which was per annum as of december  at december   the company s senior notes represented million of its million of long term debt 
debt ratings for the senior notes are b by moody s investors service and b by standard poor s corporation as of march  there are no scheduled principal payments required on any of the senior notes until march  when million is due 
the senior note indentures restrict the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness 
as of december   the company estimates that secured commercial bank indebtedness of million could have been incurred within these restrictions 
the indenture restrictions do not apply to borrowings incurred by cemi  an unrestricted subsidiary 
the senior note indentures also limit the company s ability to make restricted payments as defined  including the payment of preferred stock dividends  unless certain tests are met 
from december  through december   the company was unable to meet the requirements to incur additional unsecured indebtedness  and consequently was not able to pay cash dividends on its cumulative convertible preferred stock 
the company had accumulated dividends in arrears of million related to its preferred stock as of february  subsequent payments will be subject to the same restrictions and are dependent upon variables that are beyond the company s ability to predict 
this restriction does not affect the company s ability to borrow under or expand its secured commercial bank facility 
if the company fails to pay dividends for six quarterly periods  the holders of preferred stock will be entitled to elect two new directors to the board 
based on current projections of cash flow and fixed charges  the company does not expect to be able to pay a dividend on the preferred stock on may   which would be the sixth consecutive dividend payment date on which dividends have not been paid 
in january and february  the company engaged in five separate transactions with two institutional investors in which the company exchanged a total of million shares of common stock both newly issued and treasury shares for  shares of its issued and outstanding preferred stock with a liquidation value of million plus dividends in arrears of million 
all preferred shares acquired in these transactions were cancelled and retired and will have the status of authorized but unissued shares of undesignated preferred stock 
the company believes it has adequate resources  including cash on hand  budgeted cash flow from operations and proceeds from miscellaneous asset sales  to fund its capital expenditure budget for exploration and development activities during  which are currently estimated to be approximately million 
however  low oil and gas prices or unfavorable drilling results could cause the company to reduce its drilling program  which is largely discretionary 
recently issued accounting standards on june   the financial accounting standards board issued fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and supersedes and amends a number of existing standards 
fas as amended by fas is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  fas standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that all derivatives be recognized as assets and liabilities and measured at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives gains and losses depends on i whether the derivative is designated and qualifies as a hedge  and ii the type of hedging relationship that exists 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges or that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria in fas are required to be reported in earnings 
in addition  all hedging relationships must be designated  reassessed and documented pursuant to the provisions of fas the company has not yet determined the impact that adoption of fas will have on the financial statements 
however  the company believes that all of its derivative instruments will be designated as hedges in accordance with the relevant accounting criteria  and therefore the impact of the adoption of fas is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the company s results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for oil and natural gas production 
hedging activities periodically the company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and gas production 
these strategies include i swap arrangements that establish an index related price above which the company pays the counterparty and below which the company is paid by the counterparty  ii the purchase of index related puts that provide for a floor price below which the counterparty pays the company the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor  iii the sale of index related calls that provide for a ceiling price above which the company pays the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling  and iv basis protection swaps  which are arrangements that guarantee the price differential of oil or gas from a specified delivery point or points 
results from commodity hedging transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales to the extent related to the company s oil and gas production 
the company only enters into commodity hedging transactions related to the company s oil and gas production volumes or cemi s physical purchase or sale commitments 
gains or losses on crude oil and natural gas hedging transactions are recognized as price adjustments in the months of related production 
as of december   the company had the following open natural gas swap arrangements designed to hedge a portion of the company s domestic gas production for periods after december nymex index volume strike price months mmbtu per mmbtu april  may  june  july  august  september  october  if the swap arrangements listed above had been settled on december   the company would have incurred a gain of million 
as of december   the company had no open oil swap arrangements 
the company has also closed transactions designed to hedge a portion of the company s domestic oil and natural gas production 
the net unrecognized losses resulting from these transactions  million as of december   will be recognized as price adjustments in the months of related production 
these hedging gains and losses are set forth below in thousands hedging gains losses month gas oil total january february   march april may june july august september october subsequent to december   the company entered into the following natural gas swap arrangements designed to hedge a portion of the company s domestic gas production for periods after december nymex index volume strike price months mmbtu per mmbtu april  may  june  july  august  september  october  subsequent to december   the company entered into the following crude oil swap arrangements designed to hedge a portion of the company s domestic crude oil production for periods after december monthly nymex index volume strike price months bbls per bbl march  april  in addition to commodity hedging transactions related to the company s oil and gas production  cemi periodically enters into various hedging transactions designed to hedge against physical purchase and sale commitments made by cemi 
gains or losses on these transactions are recorded as adjustments to oil and gas marketing sales in the consolidated statements of operations and are not considered by management to be material 
interest rate risk the company also utilizes hedging strategies to manage fixed interest rate exposure 
through the use of a swap arrangement  the company believes it can benefit from stable or falling interest rates and reduce its current interest expense 
during  the company s interest rate swap resulted in a million reduction of interest expense 
the terms of the swap agreement are as follows months notional amount fixed rate floating rate may april  average of three month swiss franc libor  deutsche mark and australian dollar plus basis points may april  us three month libor plus basis points if the floating rate is less than the fixed rate  the counterparty will pay the company accordingly
