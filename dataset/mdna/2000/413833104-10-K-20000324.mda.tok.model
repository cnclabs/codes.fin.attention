statement of operations the company accounts for its operations under generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies 
on this basis  the principal measure of its financial performance is captioned net increase decrease in net assets resulting from operations  which is the sum of three elements 
the first element is net operating loss  which is the difference between the company s income from interest  dividends  fees and other income and its operating expenses  net of applicable income tax benefit provision 
the second element is net realized gain loss on investments  which is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio securities and their stated cost  net of applicable income tax benefit provision 
these two elements are combined in the company s financial statements and reported as net realized loss 
the third element  net increase in unrealized appreciation on investments  is the net change in the fair value of the company s investment portfolio  net of increase decrease in deferred income taxes that would become payable if the unrealized appreciation were realized through the sale or other disposition of the investment portfolio 
net realized gain loss on investments and net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation on investments are directly related 
when a security is sold to realize a gain loss  net unrealized appreciation decreases increases and net realized gain increases decreases

however  during  the treasury shares were decreased by purchases of a total of  shares of treasury shares by directors 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 
the company s financial condition is dependent on the success of its investments 
the company has invested a substantial portion of its assets in private development stage or start up companies 
these private businesses tend to be thinly capitalized  unproven  small companies that lack management depth  are dependent on new  commercially unproven technologies and have no history of operations 
at december    or percent of the company s total assets consisted of investments at fair value in publicly traded securities that were private businesses at the time the company made the investments  of which net unrealized appreciation was   or percent of the company s total assets consisted of non publicly traded securities at fair value in private businesses and publicly traded companies  of which net unrealized appreciation was  see recent development portfolio companies

com  inc  which subsequently became publicly traded securities  through an acquisition by a publicly traded company and an ipo  respectively 
a summary of the company s investment portfolio is as follows december  december  investments  at cost   unrealized appreciation   investments  at fair value   the accumulated unrealized appreciation on investments net of deferred taxes is  at december   versus  at december  following an initial investment in a private company  the company may make additional investments in such investee in order to increase its ownership percentage  exercise warrants or options that were acquired in a prior financing  preserve the company s proportionate ownership in a subsequent financing  or attempt to preserve or enhance the value of the company s investment 
such additional investments are referred to as follow on investments 
there can be no assurance that the company will make follow on investments or have sufficient funds to make additional investments 
the failure to make such follow on investments could jeopardize the viability of the investee company and the company s investment or could result in a missed opportunity for the company to participate to a greater extent in an investee s successful operations 
the company attempts to maintain adequate liquid capital to make follow on investments in its private investee portfolio companies 
the company may elect not to make a follow on investment either because it does not want to increase its concentration of risk  because it prefers other opportunities  or because it is inhibited by compliance with bdc or ric requirements  even though the follow on investment opportunity appears attractive

the company s investment objective is to achieve long term capital appreciation rather than current income from its investments 
therefore  a significant portion of the investment portfolio is structured to attempt to enhance the potential for capital appreciation and provides little or no current yield in the form of dividends or interest

the company has in the past relied  and continues to rely to a large extent  on proceeds from sales of investments  rather than on investment income  to defray a significant portion of its operating expenses

on january   the company placed privately  with an unaffiliated investor  for million in cash  a one year  percent note note with one year warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
the note may be prepaid at any time 
unless the note is prepaid  six months after its issuance  the investor will receive additional one year warrants to purchase an additional  worth of the company s common stock at the then current market price 
on february   the company announced its intent to pre pay the note with proceeds of its sale of  shares of sciquest 
com  inc common stock at approximately per share on february  the company continues to hold  shares of sciquest 
com common stock 
because the company intends to use most of the proceeds of the sciquest 
com sale to pre pay the note  most or all of the realized long term capital gains from this sale  approximately million  will be retained by the company and will not be distributed to shareholders as a cash dividend 
from to  the amounts receivable from brokers decreased by  or percent 
funds in escrow increased by  or percent  owing to the escrowed funds net of a reserve of  received by the company on the sale of nbx corporation 
the company received the entirety of the escrowed funds plus accrued interest for a total of  on march  the company s liabilities for accrued profit sharing and deferred income tax liability increased significantly during accrued profit sharing increased by  or percent to  as a result of the gain on the sale of nbx corporation and the increase in the unrealized appreciation on investments 
ninety percent of the profit sharing amount attributable to net realized income or approximately  was paid out in march the remaining percent or approximately  will be paid out after the company has filed its federal tax return for the year 
there was no profit sharing paid out during or previous years 
the deferred income tax liability increased by  or percent to  the deferred tax liability reflects utilization of approximately million of the company s net operating and capital loss carryforward to offset the long term capital gain realized when the company sold its interest in nbx corporation 
as a result of the utilization of the net operating and capital loss carryforwards  the company had to accrue additional tax reserves against the remaining built in gains as of december  the company s primary sources of liquidity  including cash  receivables and freely marketable securities  are more than adequate to cover the company s gross cash operating expenses over the next months 
such gross cash operating expenses totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
the company s secondary sources of liquidity are the restricted securities of companies  all of which are scheduled to become freely tradable at various times in the year the company cannot predict the amount  if any  of net after tax distributions that it might receive from its holding in phz in the year in the future  to the extent that the company decides to buy back shares or make new investments and follow on investments  the company would either have to raise capital externally and thereby incur interest or dividend expenses and or issue new shares of its stock or raise capital internally by selling appreciated securities in its portfolio 
to the extent that the company chooses to sell appreciated securities  if it wishes to retain all or part of the gains instead of distributing them as cash dividends to shareholders as a ric  it would have to declare a deemed distribution 
in the event that the company declares a deemed distribution or in the event that the company is taxed as a c corporation  it would owe a federal tax of percent  and might owe state and local taxes  on any net realized gains  and the company s asset value would decline by the amount of the tax accrual 
to the extent that the company distributes net realized gains to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends  such cash dividends would also reduce the company s asset value accordingly

recent developments sub chapter m status on september   the company s board of directors approved a proposal to seek qualification of the company as a ric under sub chapter m of the code 
in order to qualify as a ric  the company must  in general annually derive at least percent of its gross income from dividends  interest and gains from the sale of securities  quarterly meet certain investment diversification requirements  and annually distribute at least percent of its investment company taxable income as a dividend 
in addition to the requirement that the company must annually distribute at least percent of its investment company taxable income  the company may either distribute or retain its taxable net capital gains from investments  but any net capital gains not distributed could be subject to corporate level tax 
further  the company could be subject to a four percent excise tax if it fails to distribute percent of its annual taxable income and would be subject to income tax if it fails to distribute percent of its taxable income 
because of the specialized nature of its investment portfolio  the company could satisfy the diversification requirements under sub chapter m of the code only if it received a certification from the sec that it is principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions  technological improvements  new processes  or products not previously generally available 
on april   the company announced that it had received such a certification from the sec for pursuant to the company s receipt of the certification  the company s board of directors declared and paid a one time cash dividend of per share to meet one of the company s requirements for qualification for sub chapter m tax treatment 
the qualification of the company as a ric under sub chapter m of the code depends on it satisfying certain technical requirements regarding its income  investment portfolio and distributions 
the company was unable to satisfy these requirements for the tax year owing to the nature of the company s ownership interest in one of its investee companies 
in addition  because it realized taxable losses in  it was not strategically advantageous for the company to elect sub chapter m tax status for the company changed the nature of its ownership interest in the non qualifying investee company effective january  in order to meet the sub chapter m requirements 
in  because of changes in its investment portfolio  the company requested recertification from the sec relating to the company s status under section e of the code 
on february   the company received the certification  and the company intends to elect sub chapter m tax treatment for although the sec certification for was issued  there can be no assurance that the company will receive such certification for or subsequent years to the extent it needs additional certification as a result of changes in its portfolio or that it will qualify as a ric in or that  if it does qualify in  it will continue to qualify in subsequent years 
the company plans to elect sub chapter m tax treatment for in addition  under certain circumstances  even if the company were qualified for sub chapter m treatment in and elected sub chapter m treatment for that year  the company might take action in a subsequent year to ensure that it would be taxed in that subsequent year as a c corporation  rather than as a ric 
the company incurred ordinary and capital losses during its c corporation taxable years that remain available for use and may be carried forward to its and subsequent taxable years 
a c corporation that elects to qualify as a ric and that makes an appropriate election continues to be taxable as a c corporation on any gains realized within years of its qualification as a ric from sales of assets that were held by the corporation on the effective date of the election c corporation assets to the extent of any gain built into the assets on such date built in gain 
on february   the company received rulings from the irs regarding issues relevant to the company s tax status as a ric  including a ruling from the irs concluding that the company can carry forward its c corporation losses to offset any built in gains resulting from sales of its c corporation assets 
that ruling may enable the company to retain some or all of the proceeds from such sales without disqualifying itself as a ric or incurring corporate level income tax  depending on whether the company s sale of c corporation assets with built in gains will generate c corporation e p 
in general  a ric is not permitted to have  as of the close of any ric taxable year  e p accumulated during any c corporation taxable year 
however  because the realization of built in gains will occur while the company is a ric  a strong argument exists that  under current law and irs pronouncements  the sale of c corporation assets with built in gains during ric taxable years will not generate c corporation e p 
in  the company used the million loss carryforward which resulted in a tax credit of approximately million to reduce the taxes resulting from built in gains 
the december  nav includes the utilization of the ordinary and capital loss carryforwards against built in gains of approximately per share 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 
if necessary for liquidity purposes or to fund investment opportunities  in lieu of distributing its taxable net capital gains  the company may retain such net capital gains and elect to be deemed to have made a distribution of the gains  or part thereof  to the shareholders under the designated undistributed capital gain rules of section b of the code 
in such a case  the company would have to pay a percent corporate level income tax on such designated undistributed capital gain  but it would not have to distribute the excess of the retained designated undistributed capital gain over the amount of tax thereon in order to maintain its ric status 
tax consequences of net capital gains the following simplified examples illustrate the tax treatment under sub chapter m of the code for the company and its shareholders with regard to three possible alternatives  assuming a net long term capital gain of per share  consisting entirely of sales of non real property assets held for more than months 
under alternative a percent of net capital gain declared as a dividend and distributed to shareholders no federal taxation at the company level 
taxable shareholders receive a per share dividend and pay a maximum federal tax of percent or 
per share  retaining 
per share 
under alternative b percent of net capital gain retained by the company and designated as undistributed capital gain or deemed dividend the company pays a corporate level federal income tax of percent on the undistributed gain or 
per share and retains percent of the gain or 
per share 
taxable shareholders increase their cost basis in their stock by 
per share 
they pay a percent federal capital gains tax on percent of the undistributed gain of per share or 
per share in tax 
offsetting this tax  shareholders receive a tax credit equal to percent of the undistributed gain or 
per share 
under alternative c percent of net capital gain retained by the company  with no designated undistributed capital gain or deemed dividend assumes all capital gains qualify for long term rates of percent 
the company pays a corporate level federal income tax of percent on the retained gain or 
per share plus an excise tax of four percent of 
per share  or about 
per share 
there is no tax consequence at the shareholder level 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s business activities contain elements of risk 
the company considers a principal type of market risk to be valuation risk 
investments are stated at fair value as defined in the act and in the applicable regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
all assets are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by  or under the direction of  the board of directors 
see the asset valuation policy guidelines in the footnote to consolidated schedule of investments 
neither the company s investments nor an investment in the company is intended to constitute a balanced investment program 
the company has exposure to public market price fluctuations to the extent of its publicly traded portfolio 
the company has invested a substantial portion of its assets in private development stage or start up companies 
these private businesses tend to be thinly capitalized  unproven  small companies that lack management depth and have not attained profitability or have no history of operations 
because of the speculative nature and the lack of public market for these investments  there is significantly greater risk of loss than is the case with traditional investment securities 
the company expects that some of its venture capital investments will be a complete loss or will be unprofitable and that some will appear to be likely to become successful but never realize their potential 
because there is typically no public market for the equity interests of the small companies in which the company invests  the valuation of the equity interests in the company s portfolio is subject to the estimate of the company s board of directors in accordance with the company s asset valuation policy guidelines 
in the absence of a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the company s portfolio of equity interests may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if a ready market for the equity interests existed 
any changes in valuation are recorded in the company s consolidated statements of operations as net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation on investments
