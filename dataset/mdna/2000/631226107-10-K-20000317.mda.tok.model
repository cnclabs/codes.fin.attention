this improvement is the result of favorable changes in certain working capital components  including restricted cash  accounts receivable and accounts payable  offset by an increase in inventory

the increase in cash resulting from the decrease in the accounts receivable component is the result of an increase in sales from to of million combined with improved cash collections 
the increase in accounts payable is directly attributable to the increase in the inventory balance  which is the result of increased purchases in the specialty coated and label products segment to mitigate exposure to expected vendor pricing increases subsequent to year end  as well as the company s need for additional inventory to support certain new customer relationships in the imaging supplies segment and efforts to stockpile raw materials to reduce potential vendor risks with respect to the year concerns

the consolidated complaint alleged that  in connection with cerion s initial public offering  the defendants issued materially false and misleading statements and omitted the disclosure of material facts regarding  in particular  certain significant customer relationships 
in october  the circuit court on motion by the defendants  dismissed the consolidated complaint 
the plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint alleging substantially similar claims as the consolidated complaint seeking damages and injunctive relief 
on may   the circuit court  on motion by the defendants  dismissed with prejudice the second amended consolidated complaint 
the plaintiffs filed with the appellate court an appeal of the circuit court s ruling 
on november   the appellate court reversed the circuit court s ruling dismissing the second amended consolidated complaint

the company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and will continue to defend itself in this matter 
the company is involved in certain environmental matters and has been designated by the environmental protection agency epa as a potentially responsible party prp for certain hazardous waste sites 
in addition  the company has been notified by certain state environmental agencies that some of the company sites not addressed by the epa require remedial action 
these sites are in various stages of investigation and remediation 
due to the unique physical characteristics of each site  the technology employed  the extended timeframes of each remediation  the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the financial viability of other potential participants  the ultimate cost to the company of remediation for each site is difficult to estimate 
at december   based on the facts currently known and the company s prior experience with these matters  the company has concluded that it is probable that site assessment  remediation and monitoring costs will be incurred by the company with respect to those sites which can be reasonably estimated in the aggregate range of million to million for certain of the company s continuing operations  and a range of 
million to 
million for certain of the company s discontinued operations 
these ranges are based  in part  on an allocation of certain sites costs which  due to the joint and several nature of the liability  could increase if the other prps are unable to bear their allocated share 
at december   the company s accrual balances were million for continuing operations and 
million for discontinued operations  which represent  in management s view  the most likely amounts within the ranges stated above 
based on information currently available to the company  management believes that it is probable that the major responsible parties will fully pay the costs apportioned to them 
management believes that  based on its financial position and the estimated environmental accrual recorded  its remediation expense with respect to those sites is not likely to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
year issue the year yk issue is the result of computer programs being written for  or microprocessors using  two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in system failures or miscalculations 
the company categorizes its yk efforts as follows hardware  software  embedded processors  vendors and customers 
the phases of this project included awareness  inventory  risk assessment  remediation  testing and contingency planning and were completed during  and have allowed the company to continue normal operations through the transition into the year the company has conducted several analyses with significant vendors and customers to ensure their yk compliance and has noted no significant business risks 
through march   the company has not experienced any significant problems related to the yk issue 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies will not experience a year related problem in the future  or that other companies failure to remediate yk issues would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the aggregate cost of the company s yk efforts through december  was approximately million 
included in this amount were computer system hardware and software upgrades and replacements  equipment upgrades and replacements  and consulting fees 
these costs were funded through operating cash flows and included the costs of normal system upgrades and replacements for which the timing was accelerated to address the yk issue 
this amount does not include any costs associated with the implementation of the company s internally developed contingency plans or internal yk program costs as substantially all of these internal costs were payroll costs for the management information systems group 
contingency plans were developed during to deal with operational problems in the event yk compliance was not met by the company or certain third parties 
as of this writing  the company has not encountered any significant yk related problems and  therefore  the contingency plans developed by the company have not required implementation 
the company believes that it has mitigated the significant business risks related to the yk issue 
however  although the company is not currently aware of any material internal operational or financial yk related issues  the company cannot provide assurances that the computer systems  products  services or other systems upon which the company depends will not encounter yk related problems in the future  that the costs of its yk program will not become material or that the company s contingency plans will be adequate 
in addition  although the company believes the analyses conducted to ensure yk compliance of vendors and customers has mitigated the yk risk  there is no guarantee this will completely eliminate the potential for disruption 
if any such risks either with respect to the company or its vendors or customers materialize  the company could experience serious consequences to its business which could have material adverse effects on the company s financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
the foregoing assessment of the impact of the yk problem on the company is based on management s best estimates as of the date of this annual report  which are based on numerous assumptions as to future events 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove accurate  and actual results could differ materially from those estimated if these assumptions prove inaccurate
