item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations overview we are a leading provider of diversified  value added services in the areas of consulting  engineering  construction  remediation  and facilities management 
through our diverse group of highly specialized companies  clients can take advantage of a single  fully integrated delivery system and our extensive expertise 
we have a strong reputation for both the high quality of our work and the breadth of the services we provide 
during  in response to market conditions  we realigned our operating structure 
we now operate seven principal business lines in a market client focused structure  which comprise government services  energy and nuclear operations eno  commercial engineering and construction cec  solid waste  consulting and technology  outsourced services  and international 
these business lines comprise four reportable segments of engineering construction  consulting technology  outsourced services  and international 
our results of operations are analyzed on this basis 
the engineering and construction segment provides comprehensive environmental engineering and construction services to both government and commercial clients  and includes the government services  eno  cec and solid waste business lines 
the consulting technology segment provides a wide range of services in the areas of environmental health and safety compliance including web enabled knowledge management systems and training  risk and cost allocation determination  life cycle planning  chemical product development and regulatory certification  due diligence  strategic environmental planning  and real estate restoration services 
the outsourced services segment provides program construction management  general contracting services  design build construction  facility planning and management  maintenance and renovation 
the international segment provides comprehensive environmental and infrastructure services to foreign based clients through controlled entities and joint ventures  with principal operations in canada  europe  australia and taiwan 
our clients are federal  state and local governments in the us and commercial businesses worldwide 
we obtained of our revenues for the twelve months ended december  from the federal government through more than contracts that range in length from one to ten years 
in addition  we serve  commercial clients on projects which range in length from one month to more than one year 
for the twelve months ended december   our revenues were billion 
approximately of our backlog at december  was under federal government programs  and approximately is expected to be charged to our clients on a cost reimbursable basis 
additionally  many of our commercial contracts renew automatically and are typically not part of our backlog 
in the course of providing our services  we routinely subcontract services 
these subcontractor costs are passed through to clients and  in accordance with industry practice  are included in our revenue 
our cost of revenue includes subcontractor costs  salaries  direct and indirect overhead costs such as rents  utilities and travel directly attributable to projects 
our selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of costs related to the executive offices  corporate accounting  information technology  marketing and bid and proposal costs 
these costs are generally unrelated to specific client projects 
in addition  we include in these expenses amortization of intangible assets such as goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
acquisitions since fiscal  we made the following significant acquisitions to expand and diversify our business to meet our strategic objectives

twelve months ended december  compared to nine months ended december revenues and gross margin company 
revenues for the twelve months ended december  were billion  a increase over the nine months ended december  of million 
this increase is due to the full twelve months operating results and the result of increases from the gti  roche  efm and emcon acquisitions 
our gross margin for the twelve months ended december  increased to of revenues  compared to for the nine months ended december  the increase in gross margins was due to a favorable mix of higher margin revenue  contract performance  and overhead efficiencies 
our ability to maintain or improve our gross margin levels is heavily dependent on various factors including utilization of professional staff  proper execution of projects  successful bidding of new contracts at adequate margin levels and continued overhead cost controls 
a significant percentage of our revenues continue to be earned from federal government contracts with various federal agencies 
however  as a percentage of revenues  we have reduced our reliance on revenues earned from federal government contracts 
revenues from federal government contracts accounted for of our consolidated revenues in the twelve months ended december  and in the nine months ended december   reflecting a revenue mix shift to the commercial sector 
although the percentage of revenues from federal government contracts decreased  the absolute dollar amount of federal government revenues increased to million in the twelve months ended december  compared to million in the nine months ended december  this increase in revenue dollars is attributable primarily to the full twelve month period  and also to the acquisition of efm 
federal government revenues are derived principally from work performed for the department of defense dod and  to a lesser extent  the department of energy doe 
engineering construction 
revenues from the engineering construction segment increased million  or  to billion in the twelve months ended december  this increase was due to the full twelve months of operating results for fiscal when compared to the prior nine month transition period  and also due to the acquisitions of gti  efm and emcon 
our engineering construction segment includes revenues from the dod  doe  other government agencies and commercial clients serviced by our government services  eno  cec and solid waste business lines 
these business lines draw personnel  equipment and other project resource requirements from our national shared services organization 
we expect to continue to earn a substantial portion of our engineering construction segment revenues from dod indefinite delivery order contracts  which are primarily related to remedial action work 
we anticipate our engineering construction segment will experience limited growth as dod spending is projected to remain at approximately levels 
for our eno business line  recent bidding results on new doe contract awards have been impacted by significant competition  which will affect our doe revenue growth from new awards in the near term 
however  longer term we expect eno revenue growth from commercial utility decontamination and decommissioning opportunities 
in addition  we expect to increase our revenues from the doe due to an expected transition by the doe over the next several years to emphasize site closures  as opposed to studies  combined with our favorable experience in winning and executing similar work for the dod 
revenue growth from the commercial sector is expected to continue to be more directly related to the economy and to the desire on the part of our clients for strategic environmental services that provide an integrated  proactive approach to environmental issues that are driven by economic  as opposed to regulatory concerns 
to address this trend in industry spending  we have undertaken a strategy of expanding through acquisitions our integrated environmental service capabilities to provide additional proactive and cost effective environmental solutions based on economic rather than regulatory considerations 
for the twelve months ended december   revenues from government services increased million  or  to million  eno revenues  derived principally from the doe  increased million  or  to million  and commercial revenues increased million  or  to million 
the increases in revenues were partially attributable to the full twelve months of operating results in compared to the nine months ended december  the increase in government services revenues was also the result of the efm acquisition 
eno revenues also increased due to the transition to the operations phase of a million project to perform the excavation  pretreatment and drying of an estimated one million tons of materials for the doe s fernald environmental management project fernald project 
commercial revenues also increased due to the gti  efm and emcon acquisitions 
our engineering construction segment profit margin for the twelve months ended december  was million  or of segment revenues  compared to million  or of segment revenues for the nine months ended december  segment profit margin represents revenues  less cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses excluding goodwill directly attributable to operations 
government services margins were for the twelve months ended december  compared to for the nine months ended december  eno margins were for compared to for the nine months ended december  commercial margins were for compared to for the nine months ended december  improvements in margin percentages were primarily due to cost synergies and realized overhead efficiencies from the integration of the gti  efm and emcon acquisitions  along with revenue mix and contract performance 
we do not expect the overall improvement experienced in in engineering construction segment profit margins to recur 
consulting technology 
revenues from our consulting technology c t segment increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december  most of the revenues in c t are derived from commercial clients  and increased primarily due to the gti and emcon acquisitions  and also due to the full twelve months of operating results in our c t segment profit margin was million  or of segment revenues for the twelve months ended december   and million  or of segment revenues  for the nine months ended december  within the c t segment  the real estate restoration business completed transactions in which improved segment profit margins when compared to the prior period 
the timing of transactions in real estate restoration is dependent on a number of factors  not all of them within our control  which can cause significant fluctuations in segment profit margins in the periods in which transactions close 
improved margins were also the result of overhead efficiency gains related to acquisitions 
outsourced services 
revenues from outsourced services increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december  aside from increases due to the full twelve month period compared to the nine month transition period in the prior year  the increase is primarily attributable to increased contract volume at our beneco subsidiary 
beneco specializes in program construction management  general contracting services  design build construction  facility planning and management  maintenance and renovation to the dod as well as state and local government agencies 
segment revenues also increased due to our efm acquisition which provides similar services for nasa and other government agencies 
we expect segment revenue growth to continue based on strong levels of bidding opportunities and market growth 
our outsourced services segment profit margin for the twelve months ended december  was million  or of segment revenues  compared to million  or of segment revenues for the nine months ended december  margins at our beneco subsidiary decreased slightly due to a shift in contract mix to larger  longer term contracts that have lower overall profit margins 
this margin decrease was more than offset by operating results from projects and capabilities obtained with the efm acquisition 
we expect to maintain our outsourced services segment profit margins at levels 
international 
international revenues were million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the nine months ended december   and increased primarily due to the acquisitions of gti in december and roche in march the gti acquisition included approximately million of contract backlog for work to be performed for the us air force center for environmental excellence under a worldwide five year indefinite delivery order cost reimbursable contract 
our international segment profit margin was million  or of revenues for the twelve months ended december  compared to a segment loss of million for the nine months ended december  this segment profit margin improvement is primarily due to the gti and roche acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues for the twelve months ended december  compared to of revenues for the nine months ended december  due to the seasonal nature of our business  sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue are usually highest in the first calendar quarter of the year  which was excluded from the comparison with our nine month transition period ended december  on a calendar year comparison  sg a expenses were of revenues 
this annual decrease from is primarily attributable to a decreasing proportion of fixed overhead costs in relation to an increasing revenue base 
selling  general and administrative expenses include goodwill amortization expense of million for the twelve months ended december  and million for the nine months ended december  the significant increase to goodwill amortization is primarily due to the gti  roche  efm and emcon acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses excluding goodwill were of revenues for the twelve months ended december  compared to of revenues for the nine months ended december   and compared to for the calendar twelve month period ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenues for the periods noted is primarily attributable to a decreasing proportion of fixed overhead costs in relation to an increasing revenue base 
special charges there were no special charges for the twelve months ended december  we recorded million of non cash special charges for the nine months ended december   including million net of cash proceeds of million related to the sale of our investment in quanterra  incorporated and million  related to the write down of assets associated with the htts business 
all write downs were completed in the nine month transition period 
a summary of the special charges incurred is outlined below quanterra 
on may   our board of directors considered and approved the divestiture of certain non core assets including our common stock ownership interest in quanterra  incorporated  an environmental laboratory business 
this charge of million represented the net book value of our investment in quanterra less proceeds of million from a sale completed in june hybrid thermal treatment system 
on may   our board of directors considered and approved the divestiture of the assets associated with our hybrid thermal treatment system htts business 
this resulted in a charge of million representing the net book value of these assets less estimated salvage value 
interest  net net interest expense was million  or of revenues for the twelve months ended december  compared to million  or of revenues for the nine months ended december  the increase in net interest expense is due principally to the april  issuance of million   ten year senior subordinated notes which financed the roche and efm acquisitions and working capital requirements  and also due to financing the emcon acquisition in june with our revolving credit facility 
income taxes for the twelve months ended december   the income tax provision was million  reflecting an income tax rate of approximately on income of million and a million benefit from a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance attributable to utilization of tax attributes previously reserved and certain fiscal changes in financial accounting and tax rules 
for the nine months ended december   we reported a loss from continuing operations of million and recorded an income tax charge of million before adjusting for the special charge 
we also provided a deferred tax asset valuation adjustment for a portion of the special charges and recognized a tax benefit of million on the divestiture of the htts business see special charges 
the total net tax charge was million 
our effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the nine months ended december  was more than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the valuation adjustment for the above charge and amortization of cost in excess of net assets of acquired businesses see notes to consolidated financial statements note income taxes 
we will need to have approximately million of future earnings to fully realize our deferred tax asset of million net of a valuation allowance of million at december   assuming a net federal and state tax rate 
we evaluate the adequacy of the valuation allowance and the realizability of the deferred tax asset on an ongoing basis 
because of our position in the industry  recent acquisitions and restructuring  and existing backlog  management expects that our future taxable income will more likely than not allow us to fully realize our recorded net deferred tax asset of million 
the increase in the net deferred tax asset is primarily due to acquisitions 
dividends our reported dividends for the twelve months ended december  were million  and were million for the nine months ended december  our reported dividends for the nine months ended december  include imputed dividends on our convertible preferred stock of million which are not payable in cash or stock 
commencing with november   our outstanding convertible preferred stock is entitled to a cumulative cash dividend payable quarterly 
we reported cash dividends on our outstanding depositary shares each representing of a share of our cumulative convertible exchangeable preferred stock the preferred stock of million in the twelve months ended december  and million in the nine months ended december  the million increase in cash dividends between the december  and december  fiscal periods is due to the shortened nine month fiscal period

revenues from federal governmental contracts accounted for of our revenues in the nine months ended december  compared to in the twelve months ended march  the increase in government revenues for the nine months ended december  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue is primarily attributable to the ohm acquisition 
federal governmental revenues are derived principally from work performed for the dod and  to a lesser extent  the doe and are thus included in our engineering construction segment 
we believe that we have begun to benefit from this transition by the doe with the commencement in of a million project to perform the excavation  pretreatment and drying of an estimated one million tons of materials for the doe s fernald environmental management project 
the increase in commercial revenues for the nine months ended december  is primarily attributable to the ohm acquisition

our outsourced services segment profit improved to million for the nine months ended december   an increase of million when compared to the million segment profit reported in the twelve months ended march  this increase is also a result of the ohm acquisition 
international 
international revenues  primarily from our investment in chi mei it  a subsidiary operating in taiwan  were million for the nine months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended march  the increase  on an annualized basis  is the result of chi mei s increased project volume and the gti acquisition on december  our international segment reported a loss of million for both the nine months ended december  and the twelve months ended march  our present method of reporting segment profit in included the effects of minority ownership interest in internally reported segment results  and also the revised allocation of indirect expenses 
these reporting changes  which included restatement of prior periods  resulted in a reduced loss in the international segment for both the nine months ended december  and the twelve months ended march  through the chi mei board of directors  we undertook to improve management oversight  project management skills and change order negotiation efforts 
we believe these efforts will minimize future potential losses and provide the basis for profitable chi mei operations

capital expenditures were million  million and million for the twelve months ended december   the nine months ended december  and the twelve months ended march   respectively 
capital expenditures for the twelve months ended december  were million higher than the nine months ended december  due primarily to acquisition related computer system and communication requirements 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in fiscal year primarily to undertake a series of information technology enhancements designed to increase productivity and commercialize our web based environmental health and safety services

see notes to consolidated financial statements note income taxes and management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition income taxes 
long term debt of million at december  increased from million at december  primarily due to the issuance of million in ten year senior subordinated notes senior notes  which were used for the acquisitions of efm and roche  and to refinance our existing indebtedness 
long term debt also increased due to borrowings under the revolving credit facility to finance the emcon acquisition  see notes to consolidated financial statements note business acquisitions 
our ratio of total debt  including current portion  to equity was at december   at december  and at march  the senior notes have a fixed rate of interest payable semiannually in cash commencing october there are no mandatory sinking fund payments  and the senior notes have a stated maturity of april the senior notes are general unsecured obligations  subordinated to our credit facilities see senior notes to consolidated financial statements note long term debt and other senior indebtedness and pari passu with other existing and future indebtedness unless the terms of that indebtedness expressly provide otherwise 
due to conditions existent in the long term credit markets during the second half of  we utilized our revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of emcon 
as a result of the utilization of funds for acquisition purposes and working capital requirements of the seasonal aspects of our business  we had limited average availability under our revolving credit facilities 
on march   we obtained from our lenders under the credit facilities an additional million  seven year term loan term c loan  which is payable in twelve semi annual installments of million and four quarterly payments of million commencing in september through june see notes to consolidated financial statements note subsequent events 
the term c loan net proceeds of approximately million were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility portion of the credit facilities without reducing availability under the revolving portion of the credit facility  which will be used to support seasonal business pattern working capital requirements and growth from our prior acquisitions 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow  available cash and available borrowings under our credit facilities including the million increase funded on march  will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs  excluding major acquisitions  for the next twelve months 
we continue to have significant cash requirements including the service of our substantial indebtedness 
meeting the requirements of our debt agreements may from time to time affect our ability to balance operational and other cash requirements 
we are continuing with our ongoing efforts to identify acquisition candidates and simultaneously the capital sources which will be required to complete any major acquisition transaction 
backlog our total funded and unfunded backlog at december  was billion  including billion relating to our share of joint venture backlog 
at december  our backlog was approximately billion 
the increase in backlog was primarily attributable to our efm acquisition 
our backlog at december  includes approximately billion of funded backlog  of which billion is expected to be completed during  and billion of unfunded project work expected to be defined and performed during under existing indefinite delivery order contracts 
we expect to earn revenues from our backlog primarily over the next one to five years  with a substantial portion of the backlog consisting of governmental contracts  many of which are subject to annual funding and definition of project scope 
the backlog at both december  and december  includes billion and billion  respectively  of future work we estimate we will receive based on historical experience under existing indefinite delivery order programs 
in accordance with industry practices  substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation  delay or modification by the customer
