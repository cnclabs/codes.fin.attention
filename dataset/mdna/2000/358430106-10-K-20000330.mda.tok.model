item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s results of operations are affected primarily by conditions prevailing in the offshore energy industry 
in particular  the level of demand for the company s services is affected by the level of demand for the services of offshore drilling contractors  including the demand for offshore supply vessels and specific types of offshore drilling rigs having required drilling capabilities or technical specifications 
this  in turn  is dependent upon the condition of the oil and gas industry and  in particular  the level of capital expenditures of oil and gas companies with respect to offshore drilling activities and the ability of oil and gas companies to access or generate capital sufficient to fund capital expenditures for offshore exploration  development  and production activities 
these capital expenditures are influenced by prevailing oil and natural gas prices  expectations about future prices  the level of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the united states and overseas  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas  local and international political and economic conditions  and the ability of oil and gas companies to access or generate capital sufficient to fund capital expenditures for offshore exploration  development and production activities 
over the past several years  oil and natural gas prices and the level of offshore drilling activity have fluctuated substantially 
according to offshore data services  inc as of march   the utilization rate of the worldwide fleet of offshore mobile drilling units was  only slightly less than the utilization rate of a year ago 
this level of drilling activity is generally attributed to a number of recent industry trends  including three dimensional seismic mapping  directional drilling and other advances in technology that have increased drilling success rates and efficiency and have led to the discoveries of oil and gas in subsalt geological formations which generally are located in depths of to feet of water and deepwater areas of the gulf of mexico 
in the deepwater areas where larger and more technically advanced drilling rigs are needed  increased drilling activity resulted in increased demand for newly constructed semi submersible drilling rigs and for retrofitting offshore drilling rigs 
a significant or prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices or the expectation that prices will be lower in the future would likely depress offshore drilling and development activity which would reduce demand for the company s services and could result in a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the business of the company  including the types of projects it undertakes  will also be affected by other factors affecting offshore drilling contractors  including factors such as i the condition and drilling capabilities of the existing offshore drilling rigs operated by offshore drilling contractors and ii the relative costs of building a new offshore drilling rig with advanced capabilities versus the costs of retrofitting or converting an existing offshore drilling rig to provide similar capabilities 
low prices for crude oil and natural gas experienced during and much of created a general decline in the demand for the company s products 
although the prices of these commodities have recently increased  there can be no assurance that drilling contractors and vessel operators will proceed with plans for new construction or modification of drilling units and or vessels 
the company has maintained a significant contract backlog of deepwater related projects 
at december   the company s backlog was approximately million 
the company s backlog at december  was approximately million  of which million was related to contracts acquired through the hmg merger 
over million of total backlog at year end was related to deepwater projects 
some new contracts included in backlog are subject to cancellation by the customers  however  the company has had no indication that any of its contracts might be canceled 
in february  the company entered into a million contract with a brazilian company for the new build construction of a friede goldman  ltd 
designed millennium sa semi submersible drilling rig 
the contract contained a financing contingency which was not met  therefore  it is not included in the company s backlog at december  the company does not currently anticipate that this project will result in a firm contract 
a significant portion of the company s existing contracts are on a fixed price basis 
the company would be liable for the full amount of any cost overruns under these fixed price contracts 
the company generally attempts to cover anticipated increased costs through an estimation of these costs  which is reflected in the original price of the contract 
however  revenue  cost and gross profit realized on a fixed price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of many factors  including changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract 
the results of operations and financial condition of the company could be materially adversely affected if significant contracts are underpriced or revenue and gross profits on large projects are different from those originally estimated 
the construction of offshore drilling rigs involves complex design and engineering and equipment and supply delivery coordination throughout construction periods that may exceed two years 
it is not unusual in such circumstances to encounter design  engineering  equipment delivery schedule changes and other factors that impact the builder s ability to complete construction of the rig in accordance with the original contractual delivery schedule 
the company s construction contracts generally require the customer to compensate the company for additional work or expenses incurred due to customer requested change orders or failure of the customer to provide design or engineering information or equipment  if specified in the contract for the customer to provide these items 
under these circumstances  the company generally negotiates with the customer with respect to the amount of compensation to be paid following the time at which the change order was requested or the customer failed to provide the items required by the contract 
the company is subject to risk that when it is unable to obtain  through negotiation  arbitration  litigation or otherwise  adequate amounts to compensate for the additional work or expenses incurred due to customer requested change orders or failure by the customer to timely provide items required to be provided by the customer 
a failure to obtain adequate compensation for these matters could require the company to record an adjustment to amounts of revenue and gross profit that were recognized in prior periods under the percentage of completion accounting method 
any such adjustments  if substantial  could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
additionally  many of the company s existing contracts contain provisions requiring the payment by the company of liquidated damages in the event that it fails to meet specified performance deadlines 
it cannot be assured that the company will not be required to make payments under these liquidated damages provisions or that the requirement to make payments will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in certain circumstances  delivery delay beyond a specified period would entitle a customer to terminate the contract and to elect various remedies  including return of the purchase price 
the company s operations are subject to variations from quarter to quarter and year to year resulting from fluctuations in demand for the company s services and  due to the large amounts of revenue that are typically derived from a small quantity of projects and the timing of the receipt of awards for new projects 
in addition  the company schedules projects based on the timing of available capacity to perform the services requested and  to the extent that there are delays in the arrival of a drilling rig or production unit into the shipyard  the company generally is not able to utilize the excess capacity created by such delays 
although the company may be able to offset the effect of such delays through adjustments to the size of its skilled labor force on a temporary basis  such delays may adversely affect the company s results of operations in any period in which such delays occur 
most of the company s revenue is earned on a percentage of completion basis based generally on the ratio of total costs incurred to the total estimated costs 
accordingly  contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as the work progresses  and adjustments to income proportion ate to the percentage of completion are reflected in the period when such estimates are revised 
to the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits  the company would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
in january  the company entered into a confidential settlement agreement with ocean rig asa  a norwegian company  relating to a dispute with respect to contracts to construct two semi submersible drilling rigs 
among other things  the settlement with ocean rig allowed for an increase of million in the contract price of each rig and revised delivery dates of october  and december  for the two rigs 
the company has adjusted previously recognized revenues and gross profits to reflect the percentage of completion based on the revised delivery dates and related cost estimates and expected recoveries 
the net impact of this adjustment to account for the settled claim and related additional costs incurred and for the timing of recognition of related revenues and expenses was a net reduction for the year ended december  of approximately million 
the amount of the adjustment was based on  among other things  the outcome of the settlement negotiations and management s estimate of the percentage of completion of the projects at the end of the year 
in late march  fgot and petrodrill reached an agreement  which is subject to various approvals  including that of marad and the boards of directors of each company  to amend two contracts relating to the construction of two semi submersible rigs the amendment no 

amendment no 
will stay for six months the litigation proceeding previously commenced in the united kingdom the uk action and will dismiss the litigation previously commenced in the united states  with prejudice  except as to fgot s rights to pursue its enumerated claims against petrodrill for additional compensation in the uk action 
under amendment no 
 the delivery dates for the rigs will be extended until august  and november   respectively  petrodrill will waive all of its claims against fgot accruing prior to the amendment  including its right to terminate the contracts for events occurring prior to amendment no 
 total liquidated damages for late delivery beyond the new delivery dates will be capped at million for each rig  any future right of petrodrill to terminate each contract will accrue only if the respective rig is not delivered within days of its extended delivery date  as such date may be further extended under other contractual provisions  and fgot will credit petrodrill up to million per rig against any amounts awarded against petrodrill  but only to the extent fgot recovers against petrodrill 
after the six month stay of the uk action  fgot intends to vigorously pursue its claims for additional compensation 
notwithstanding the amendment  the company intends to proceed with construction of the rigs while pursuing any and all remedies available to it under the contracts and applicable law 
if the contract delivery dates are not extended as provided in amendment no 
for any reason  including any failure to obtain an approval required for amendment no 
to become effective  fgot will not be in a position to deliver the rigs on or before the pre amendment delivery dates  or the date on which petrodrill s contractual right to terminate the contracts will accrue 
petrodrill s remedies upon termination include among others  the right to rescind the contracts  transfer the rigs to fgot  and demand reimbursement for all amounts paid  including amounts paid for owner furnished equipment 
fgot would likely not be in a position to meet such a demand  and if such demand was successfully asserted  it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
based upon current estimates  the company believes that it will incur approximately million in costs in excess of the contract prices  as adjusted for change orders  to complete these contracts 
a provision for these excess costs has been provided in the company s purchase accounting treatment of assets and liabilities acquired through the merger with hmg 
the balance of the excess costs at december  was approximately million and is included in the reserve for losses on uncompleted contracts in the consolidated balance sheets 
management expects such costs will be expended by the company over eighteen months beginning in april any revisions of the estimates of costs and claims recoveries in the next months should be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
the funding of these excess costs could have a significant impact on the company s liquidity

comparison of the years ended december  and during the year ended december   the company generated revenue of million  an increase of  compared to the million generated for the year ended december  of this increase  approximately million was attributable to businesses acquired through the hmg merger 
revenue for the offshore segment increased by million or in this increase was primarily caused by revenues of approximately million generated by offshore entities acquired in the hmg merger  and approximately million attributable to the ongoing construction of two semi submersible drilling rigs  offset by an million decline in revenue primarily related to the completion and outfitting of seven conversions in and a portion of which were not replaced in due to a decrease in demand for conversion projects 
also contributing to the company s overall growth in revenue in were million in revenues generated by the vessels segment acquired through the hmg merger 
revenue for the engineered products segment decreased million or in as result of the completion of projects which were not replaced due to a decrease in demand 
revenues in this segment include million generated by the engineered products group acquired in the hmg merger 
cost of revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  gross profit decreased from million or in to million or in gross profit for the offshore segment decreased from in to a negative in this decrease was primarily related to a shift in the mix of the segment s business to new build completion of semi submersible drilling rigs  from the higher margin  business of repair  conversion and retrofitting of drilling rigs 
the company recorded a gross loss on two contracts in the amount of million  including a provision for future losses of million 
in addition  a third contract for the completion of a semi submersible rig experienced minimal gross profit 
these decreases were offset by an million increase in gross profit generated by offshore operations acquired in the hmg merger 
gross profit for the newly acquired vessels segment was million or 
gross profit for the engineered products segment decreased from in to in primarily as result of the lower volume of revenue recognized by the segment in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in sg a expenses primarily reflects the inclusion of sg a expenses of hmg for two months as well as an increase in sales and administrative workforce and facilities due to overall growth of the company s business 
legal fees also increased from to amortization of goodwill increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the hmg merger 
operating income decreased by million from million for the year ended december  to an operating loss of million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of increased revenue and decreased gross profit discussed in the preceding paragraphs 
net interest expense interest expense less interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of interest and fees associated with increased borrowings by the company prior to the merger  interest expense in the amount of million related to accretion of the million discount recorded to reflect the fair market value of the million convertible subordinated notes assumed in connection with the hmg merger  additional interest expense as a result of the in debt assumed by the company in connection with the hmg merger  and increased usage and amortization of fees associated with the new credit facility see management s discussion and analysis liquidity and capital resources 
the change in other income expense was primarily attributable to miscellaneous items  none of which are individually material 
the company had an income tax benefit of million in compared to income tax expense of million in reflecting the company s pretax loss of million in compared to pretax income of million in comparison of the years ended december  and during the year ended december   the company generated revenue of million  an increase of  compared to the million generated for the year ended december  this increase was caused by an increase in demand for conversion and retrofit services related to deep water offshore drilling rigs  revenues of approximately million attributable to the completion and outfitting of an existing semisubmersible drilling rig hull  approximately million of revenues attributable to the new construction of semi submersible drilling rigs  and revenues of approximately million generated by the company s marystown facility and french operations 
cost of revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   resulting in an increase in gross profit from million for the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues can be explained as follows the new build construction of semisubmersible offshore drilling rigs generally results in lower gross margin percentages than those generated from repair and retrofit work  the company earned smaller margin percentages on contracts assumed upon the acquisition of the marystown facility  and margin percentages earned on equipment sales from the company s french operations  while typically higher than margins earned on new build construction are generally less than those earned from repair and retrofit work 
management expects that gross margins  as a percentage of revenues  may trend lower as a more significant portion of the company s total revenue is derived from the new construction of offshore drilling rigs and from sales of equipment 
such lower gross margin percentages result from a higher dollar volume of lower margin material and subcontract costs included in cost of revenue  and from a greater portion of the total project being performed on a fixed price basis 
gross margins on repair and retrofit projects also vary based on  among other things  the size of the project undertaken 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses were million in the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in sg a expenses reflects an increase in sales and administrative workforce and facilities due to overall growth of the company s business  the additional administrative costs associated with international activities and costs associated with being a publicly held corporation 
operating income increased by million from the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of increased revenue and gross profit discussed in the preceding paragraphs 
net interest expense interest expense less interest income declined to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of increased interest expense attributable to borrowings related to fgo east and equipment additions in the existing fgo west yard 
the change in other income expense is primarily attributable to miscellaneous items  none of which are individually material 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  reflects a composite income tax rate of approximately including foreign taxes of approximately million 
the actual and proforma provision for income taxes for the year ended december   reflects a combined federal and state tax rate of 
the decline in the overall rate for the year ended december  is the result of available state income tax credits related to increased employment levels at the company s pascagoula  mississippi locations 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its business activities through funds generated from operations  a credit facility secured by accounts receivable and long term borrowings secured by assets acquired with proceeds from such borrowings 
net cash provided by used in operations was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the change in cash flows from operating activities in was the company s net loss of million  an increase in net contract costs of million  and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
during the year ended december   the company incurred approximately million in capital expenditures compared to million during when the company was completing its fgo east facility 
in addition  in february  approximately million was expended for the acquisition of the company s french subsidiary 
capital expenditures were funded in primarily from the company s cash balances  and borrowings under a credit facility 
the capital expenditures and acquisition costs were funded from operating cash flow  borrowings under its credit facility  the issuance of million in bonds guaranteed by the united states maritime administration marad  the issuance of million of mississippi business finance corporation taxable industrial development revenue bonds the mbfc bonds  and million in equipment financing 
the company anticipates that its level of capital expenditures during will not exceed million 
during  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan under which the company could repurchase shares of its common stock in open market transactions with an aggregate fair value of up to million 
through december   the company had repurchased  shares of its common stock for an aggregate of approximately million 
the company utilized a million short term credit facility provided by an investment banking firm to finance a portion of the purchases 
no amounts were outstanding under that arrangement as of december  during the company s board of directors discontinued the share repurchase program  and no additional purchases were made during the year 
at december   the company had invested approximately million in an unconsolidated subsidiary ilion llc in which the company currently owns a equity interest 
the company s ownership interest in ilion llc is expected to be reduced to 
ilion llc owns a hull for a semi submersible drilling rig that requires substantial completion and outfitting 
the company and the other member of ilion llc who is also one of the company s largest customers are considering various options for formal arrangements related to the hull  including financing of the completion  securing a contract for utilization or sale of the rig  or other options 
the company s investment in ilion llc was financed through cash flow from operations 
other than the initial purchase of the drilling rig hull  ilion llc has had no significant activity as of december  the company s investment in ilion llc is accounted for using the equity method 
in march  fgo entered into a credit facility the credit facility that provided for borrowings of up to million  subject to a borrowing base limitation equal to of eligible receivables 
the credit facility was secured by contract related receivables 
during  the borrowing capacity under the credit facility was increased to million and was extended until march  during  the company extended the maturity of its credit facility and entered into a supplemental bank credit facility the supplemental facility to provide for an additional million in borrowings 
borrowings under the credit facility and the supplemental facility were secured by the pledge of substantially all of the company s domestic assets not otherwise encumbered 
borrowings under the credit facility and the supplemental facility were to mature on the earlier of november   or the closing of the hmg merger 
in connection with the merger with hmg  on november   the company entered into a new secured bank revolving and letter of credit facility the new credit facility that replaced the credit facility 
under the terms of the new credit facility  the company may borrow up to million under a senior secured revolving credit facility 
in addition  the new credit facility provides a million senior secured letter of credit facility 
the new credit facility has a three year term and is secured by substantially all of the company s otherwise unencumbered assets  all of the company s domestic subsidiaries and of the stock of its foreign subsidiaries 
the interest rate ranges from to over the london inter bank offered rate libor  or the base rate as defined  at the company s choice 
under the new credit facility  the company is obligated to pay certain fees  including an annual commitment fee in an amount of 
of the unused portion of the commitment 
amounts outstanding under the new credit facility may not exceed an amount based on specified percentages of the company s accounts receivable  inventory and net contract related investments 
at december   the company had million in cash advances under the credit agreement with million available under the new credit facility 
average usage since inception of the new credit facility has been million  resulting in an average availability of million over the same period 
the new credit facility requires the company to comply with certain financial covenants  including limitations on additional borrowings and capital expenditures  certain debt coverage ratios  minimum net worth and other customary requirements 
at december   the company was not in compliance with the leverage ratio  the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and the minimum net worth requirement 
on march   the company obtained a waiver of noncompliance with these requirements and an amendment to the new credit facility that among other things  amends the leverage ratio  the fixed charge coverage ratio  and minimum net worth requirement  and requires the commitment amount under the new credit facility to be reduced by of the net proceeds of asset sales 
the amendment changes the interest rate to the lender s base rate plus per annum until the company completes certain of its contracts 
it is not anticipated that the company will complete these contracts until the fourth quarter of in connection with the amendment  the company is obligated to pay certain fees  including an annual commitment fee in an amount of of the unused portion of the commitment 
the company believes that cash generated from operations  including the collection of recoverable income taxes  million at december   the settlement of certain recoverable contract claims  and funds available under the new credit facility will be sufficient to fund its requirements for working capital including contract losses  capital expenditures  and other capital needs for at least the next months and to remain in compliance with the new loan covenants 
however  additional debt or equity financing or asset sales may be required if the company s estimated costs on the ocean rig contracts and or the petrodrill contracts are materially higher than those utilized in preparing the financial statements at december  or if the company s level of business activity picks up considerably and the company is unable to negotiate contract terms that provide for contract funding as costs are incurred 
although the company believes that  under such circumstances  it would be able to obtain additional funding from these sources  there can be no assurance that funding from these sources will be available to the company for these purposes or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to the company 
year yk year issues arose from the fact that many software applications  hardware and equipment and embedded chip systems identify dates using only the last two digits of the year 
these products may not have been able to distinguish between dates in the year and dates in the year in prior periods  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
expenses incurred by the company in association with the overall year efforts were insignificant 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with products  internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
given the company s historically minimal use of these types of instruments  the company does not expect a material impact on its statements from adoption of sfas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates  primarily in the united states 
the company s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
the company currently does not use any derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
the table below provides information about the company s future maturities of principal for outstanding debt instruments and fair value at december  all instruments described are non trading instruments in thousands

the company currently does not use any off balance sheet hedging instruments to manage its risks associated with its operating activities conducted in foreign currencies unless that particular operation enters into a contract in a foreign currency which is different that the local currency of the particular operation 
in limited circumstances and when considered appropriate  the company will utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge the anticipated purchases and or sales 
the company has historically used these instruments primarily in the manufacturing and selling of certain marine deck equipment 
the company attempts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching its revenues and expenses in the same currency for its contracts 
as of december   the company does not have any outstanding forward exchange contracts
