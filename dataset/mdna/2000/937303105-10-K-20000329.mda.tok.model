item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations note this discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors 
specific factors include  among others  the impact of interest rates changes  risks of acquiring or opening new branches  controlling expenses  and general economic conditions 
overview the company continued its strategy of growth and enhancing its market penetration throughout this resulted in the creation of a full service office in sedro woolley skagit county  relocation of two offices to larger more convenient locations island and whatcom counties  the opening of a residential real estate loan production office in port townsend jefferson county  and consolidation of the whidbey city branch with the remaining three south whidbey offices island county 
the company has also added two offices in mount vernon skagit county a grocery store branch that opened in january and a real estate loan production office in february also in  the company developed a private banking division  implemented an internet online banking system  added business cash management products and services for commercial customers  enhanced its website  expanded its real estate lending service locations  continued to develop its retail investment division  and substantially increased its number of atms from five at year end to currently 
washington banking company s objective is to continue its strategy of growth  enhance its market penetration in the areas it currently serves  and improve its profitability and operating efficiencies 
the company looks for expansion opportunities that meet its criteria primarily in the geographic areas north and northwest of seattle to the canadian border 
growth can be expected to require the expenditure of substantial sums to purchase or lease real property and equipment and to hire experienced personnel 
new branch offices are often not profitable for at least the first eighteen months after opening and management expects that earnings will be negatively affected as the company pursues its growth strategy 
financial condition total assets 
total assets increased to million at december  from million at december   an increase of 
this increase resulted primarily from growth in the loan portfolio  mostly funded by deposit growth 
total loans 
total loans amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
commercial loans grew to million at december  from million at december   while consumer loans increased to million from million during that same period 
commercial loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to at december  from at december   and consumer loans increased to of total loans from at those dates 
real estate loans increased to of total loans at december  from at december   while real estate construction loans decreased to from as of those dates 
total investment securities 
total investment securities were million and million at december  and  respectively 
in the availability of excess funds for long term investment purchases was significantly reduced by the need for funding the strong loan demand 
premises and equipment 
premises and equipment  net  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in over reflects upgrading computer systems  remodeling of offices  purchase of land for branch offices  construction of branch offices  and related furniture  fixture and equipment purchases 
deposit accounts 
deposit accounts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
management attributes this increase to a combination of its efforts to attract deposits through competitive pricing  delivery of quality service and the expansion of its market area 
shareholders equity 
shareholders equity was million and million at december  and  respectively 
this slight increase reflects earnings of million  cash dividends of  and million for repurchase of approximately  shares of common stock 
net interest income like most financial institutions  the primary component of earnings for the company is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loan and investment securities portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and company borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
for this purpose  volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as levels of noninterest bearing liabilities 
during the fiscal years ended december   and  average interest earning assets were million  million and million  respectively 
during these same periods  the company s net interest margins were  and  respectively

results of operations net income 
the company reported net income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
diluted net income per share was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in net income for each year was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income and to a lesser extent increases in noninterest income partially offset by increases in noninterest expenses and an increase in the provision for loan losses 
the decrease in diluted net income per share from to and from to was primarily attributable to the increased number of average outstanding shares as a result of the initial public offering in june net interest income 
net interest income for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year was million  or  and in was million  or  as a result of average interest earning assets increasing more in actual total dollars than average interest bearing liabilities 
the difference was funded by growth in noninterest bearing deposits  shareholders equity  and maturing investment securities 
average interest earning assets increased million and million for fiscal years ended and  respectively  while average interest bearing liabilities increased by million and million for the same periods 
the average yield on interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to a decrease in the rates earned on loans 
average yield on loans decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  in addition  an overall decrease in rates earned on investments contributed to the decrease in average yield on interest earning assets 
average yields on taxable investments increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  and decreased from for the year ended december  average yields on non taxable investments decreased to for the year ended december  from and  respectively  for the years ended december  and the average yield on interest bearing liabilities also decreased in to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  as rates on most deposit types decreased during the year 
for the year ended  the yield on average interest bearing liabilities decreased from for the year ended december  average interest earning assets increased from december  to december  and from december  to december   and average interest bearing liabilities increased and  respectively  during the same periods 
the overall result of these changes was an increase in the net interest spread to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  and a decrease from for the year ended december  and a decrease in net interest margin to from and  respectively  for the same periods 
provision for loan losses 
the company s provision for loan losses for the years ended december   and totaled   and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to provide for possible loan losses based on management s assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio 
these factors include the quality of the loan portfolio  problem loans  business conditions  loss experience  underlying collateral and the local economy 
the provision for loan losses was increased in  and to keep pace with the strong growth and losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
during  the allowance for loan losses increased by  the allowance represented

noninterest income 
noninterest income for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increases of  in and  in are primarily related to fees received on third party originated real estate loans and reflect the upsurge of the mortgage loan market in and the less favorable market 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
an increase of in and in these increases were primarily related to compensation and employee benefits  occupancy expense  office supplies and printing  and data processing expenses 
this reflects the rapid expansion of the company which began in late and is more fully reflected in  and included in increased salaries and benefits expense were expanded staffing levels in executive and administrative personnel  branch personnel and additions to mortgage lending and consumer lending departments 
the company expects this trend in increased noninterest expense to continue to slow as total asset growth slows and total operating efficiencies improve

these funds  together with loan repayments  are used to make loans and to fund continuing operations 
in addition  at december  the company had unused lines of credit with the federal home loan bank of seattle fhlb of million and unused lines of credit with financial institutions in the amount of million  with no advances on these lines of credit at december  the company expects to use fhlb advances to supplement its funding sources 
total deposits were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
deposits increased from december  to december  and from december  to december  the company  by policy  has not accepted brokered deposits 
it has made a concerted effort to attract deposits in the market area it serves through competitive pricing and the delivery of quality service 
the company s deposits are expected to fluctuate according to the level of the company s deposit market share  economic conditions  and normal seasonal variations  among other things 
certificates of deposit are the only deposit group that have stated maturity dates 
at december   the company had million in certificates of deposit of which approximately million  or  are scheduled to mature on or prior to december  based on prior experience  the company anticipates that a substantial portion of outstanding certificates of deposit will renew upon maturity 
management anticipates that the bank will rely primarily upon customer deposits  loan repayments and current earnings to provide liquidity  and will use such funds primarily to make loans and to purchase securities  primarily issued by the federal government and state and local governments 
additional funds are available through established fhlb lines of credit 
the company s shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december  and from million at december  the increase from year end to year end was from net income less dividends and company stock repurchases 
the increase from year end to year end was from net income less dividends plus million in proceeds from the company s initial public offering in june of at december   shareholders equity was of total assets compared to and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in this ratio from year end primarily results from strong asset growth and company stock repurchases in the company approved a stock repurchase plan in april which allows the company to repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares at an average price of 
capital ratios the bank is subject to minimum capital requirements 
see supervision and regulation on page of this report 
as the following table indicates  the bank exceeded regulatory capital requirements december  minimum well capitalized actual requirement requirement ratio total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio management expects the bank to remain well capitalized for regulatory purposes  although there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required in the near future due to greater than expected growth  or otherwise 
year issues the company experienced no failure of mission critical systems and no significant issues with external vendors or customers associated with the year rollover date change 
quality control reviews were performed following the event and were continued through february   without incident 
in  the company incurred approximately  in direct  specifically identifiable expense  associated with year issues 
soft costs for personnel hours associated with the project are estimated at approximately  for costs for the project total approximately  in addition  the company upgraded the generator at its administrative office and purchased generators for hub branches as part of contingency plans for its business operations in general and not specifically related to year issues 
the company does not anticipate any significant issues or additional costs in fiscal associated with the year rollover date change 
impact of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on the company s operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
asset liability management the company s results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income 
like most financial institutions  the company s interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the market place 
the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting the company s earnings from undue interest rate risk  which arises from volatile interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk  and capital adequacy 
the company maintains an asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing the following ratios and trend analysis liquidity  equity  volatile liability dependence  portfolio maturities  maturing assets and maturing liabilities 
the company s policy is to control the exposure of its earnings to changing interest rates by generally endeavoring to maintain a position within a narrow range around an earnings neutral position  which is defined as the mix of assets and liabilities that generate a net interest margin that is least affected by interest rate changes 
when suitable lending opportunities are not sufficient to utilize available funds  the company has generally invested such funds in securities  primarily us treasury securities  securities issued by governmental agencies  municipal securities and corporate obligations 
the securities portfolio contributes to the company s profits and plays an important part in the overall interest rate management 
however  management of the securities portfolio alone cannot balance overall interest rate risk 
the securities portfolio must be used in combination with other asset liability management interest rate risk  and investing in securities that can be pledged for public deposits 
in reviewing the needs of the company with regard to proper management of its asset liability program  the company s management estimates its future needs  taking into consideration historical periods of high loan demand and low deposit balances  estimated loan and deposit increases due to increased demand through marketing  and forecasted interest rate changes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that financial performance will decline over time due to changes in prevailing interest rates and resulting yields on interest earning assets and costs of interest bearing liabilities 
a number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including income simulations and interest sensitivity gap analyses 
an income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets  cash flows and maturities of other investment securities  loan and deposit volumes and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
based on the results of the income simulation model as of december   the company would expect an increase in net interest income of  if interest rates increase from current rates by basis points and a decrease in net interest income of  if interest rates decrease from current rates by basis points 
the analysis of an institution s interest rate gap the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during a given period of time is another standard tool for the measurement of the exposure to interest rate risk 
the company believes that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance  it should be used in conjunction with other methods of evaluating interest rate risk 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap of the company s interest earning assets and interest earning liabilities at december  the interest rate gaps reported in the table arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals 
the amounts shown below could be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawals of deposits and competition dollars in thousands months months years over years total interest earning assets federal funds sold   investment securities      loans      total interest earning assets      interest earning assets to total assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits   money market deposits   savings deposits   time deposits     total interest bearing liabilities     interest bearing liabilities to total liabilities interest sensitivity gap      cumulative interest sensitivity gap     cumulative interest sensitivity gap  as a percentage of total assets the table illustrates that if assets and liabilities reprice in the time intervals indicated in the table  the company is liability sensitive months and asset sensitive thereafter 
thus the table indicates that in an environment of increasing interest rates  the net interest income of the company would be adversely affected and in a declining interest rate environment  the company s net interest income would be favorably affected 
as stated above  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
for instance  while the table is based on the assumption that interest bearing demand accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts are immediately sensitive to movements in rates  the company expects that in a changing rate environment the amount of the adjustment in interest rates for such accounts would be less than the adjustment in categories of assets which are considered to be immediately sensitive 
additionally  certain assets have features that restrict changes in the interest rates of such assets both on a short term basis and over the lives of such assets 
further  in the event of a change in market interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in market interest rates 
due to these shortcomings  the company places primary emphasis on its income simulation model when managing its exposure to changes in interest rates
