during  the company invested approximately million in the expansion of its existing communities  resulting in the addition of available sites to its portfolio 
in addition  during  the company invested or advanced million to certain affiliates of the company

for the year ended december   recurring property capital expenditures  other than development costs  were approximately million 
capital expenditures have historically been financed out of funds from operations and it is the company s intention that such future expenditures will also be financed with funds from operations 
as of december   the company had a line of credit with bank one  na  acting as lead agent  for million the bank one credit facility 
the interest rate is at libor plus basis points  and matures in may in addition to the bank one credit facility  the company had a million revolving line of credit from us bank which bears interest at a rate of libor plus basis points and a maturity of september the usb facility and  together with the bank one credit facility  the credit facilities 
as of december   approximately million was outstanding under the credit facilities and the company had available million in additional borrowing capacity 
as of december   the company had outstanding  in addition to the credit facilities  million of unsecured senior debt with a weighted average interest rate and remaining maturity of percent and years  respectively  and million of secured mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate and remaining maturity of percent and years  respectively 
as of december   the company had approximately million of total debt outstanding  representing approximately percent of the company s total market capitalization 
all of the debt is fixed rate debt  other than the company s credit facilities  and has a weighted average interest rate of percent 
in february  the company issued million of unsecured senior notes due march  the company received net proceeds of nearly million  which were used to repay million of senior unsecured notes which matured march  the remaining million was used to repay a portion of the borrowings on its line of credit 
the company  in february  also entered into a million note with bank one  na the note can be drawn on for thirty  sixty or ninety day increments beginning february   and must be repaid in full on august  the note bears interest at a rate of libor plus basis points 
the funds available under the note are expected to be used to fund short term liquidity needs of the company 
the company has another million coming due in which it expects to repay with the proceeds from the issuance of secured or unsecured debt  depending on the current market conditions 
on february   the company announced the establishment of a share repurchase program pursuant to which it may repurchase up to  shares of common stock from time to time 
in addition to repayment of long term borrowings and amounts outstanding under the credit facilities  future acquisitions of communities and land for development and new community development activities represent the principal long term liquidity needs of the company 
the company does not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to finance these long term liquidity needs and instead intends to meet its long term liquidity requirements through additional borrowing under the credit facilities or other lines of credit  the assumption of existing secured or unsecured indebtedness and depending on market conditions and capital availability factors  the issuance of additional equity or debt securities 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements  including expansion activities and capital expenditure requirements and maturing debt obligations  through cash flows from operations and  if necessary  borrowings under the credit facilities and other lines of credit 
inflation all of the leases or terms of tenants occupancies at the communities allow for at least annual rental adjustments 
in addition  all leases are short term generally one year or less and enable the company to seek market rentals upon reletting the sites 
such leases generally minimize the risk to the company of any adverse effect of inflation 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which is effective for the company in the year the only derivative instrument the company currently utilizes is an interest rate hedge agreement for million of its senior notes 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be measured on the balance sheet at fair value 
the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas will not have a significant effect on its financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the implementation of sfas for the company s financial statements to january  in anticipation of the million senior notes maturing on march   the company entered into a million interest rate hedge transaction with a financial institution in order to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  with a maturity of april under this arrangement  the company pays or receives an amount equal to the difference between the hedge rate and the market rate on the date of settlement  based on an anticipated million borrowing 
the realized gain or loss on the transaction settlement date will be recorded on the balance sheet and amortized to interest expense over the period of the related notes 
at december   the treasury lock rate was lower than the market rate  therefore  the company has an unrealized gain of approximately  year the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications abbreviate dates by eliminating the first two digits of the year  assuming that these two digits are always 
as a result  date sensitive computer programs may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year unless corrected  the potential exists for computer system failures or incorrect processing of financial and operational information  which could disrupt operations 
the company believes that all systems have been appropriately modified and does not expect the year issue will materially impact the financial condition or operations of the company 
other funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as consolidated net income of the company without giving effect to gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  certain non recurring items and rental property depreciation and amortization 
management believes that ffo is an important and widely used measure of the operating performance of reits  which provides a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
ffo i does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  ii should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  and iii is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is calculated as follows for the year ended december  in thousands income before extraordinary item and minority interests    less income allocated to preferred op units   plus depreciation of rental property    amortization of intangibles non recurring items  net gain on sales of properties  funds from operations    nareit has revised its definition of ffo 
the company plans to adopt the new definition effective january  the new definition of ffo substantially eliminates the add back of the non recurring items in the calculation of the ffo 
the application of this new would not have affected reported ffo for calendar year or  and would have decreased ffo in by  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
management has and will continue to manage interest rate risk by maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level and taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long term debt and or equity 
as of december   the company s credit facilities represented its only variable rate debt 
the following table sets forth information as of december   concerning the company s long term debt obligations  including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value fv for the year ended december  thereafter total fv long term debt fixed rate       average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate total debt        in addition  the company has assessed the market risk for its variable rate debt and believes that a increase in interest rates would have an approximate  increase in interest expense based on million outstanding at december  the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflects the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration
