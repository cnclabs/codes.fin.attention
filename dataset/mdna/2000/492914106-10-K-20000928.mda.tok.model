business strategy key has built its leadership position through the consolidation of smaller  less viable competitors 
this consolidation  together with a continuing decline in the number of available domestic well service rigs due to attrition  cannibalization and transfers outside of the united states  has given key the opportunity to capitalize on improved market conditions which existed during fiscal key has focused on maximizing results by reducing debt  building strong customer alliances  refurbishing rigs and related equipment  and training personnel to maintain a qualified and safe employee base 
reducing debt 
over the past fiscal year  key has significantly reduced debt and strengthened its balance sheet 
at june   key s long term funded debt net of cash net funded debt was approximately  and its net funded debt to capitalization was approximately as compared to approximately  and  respectively  at june  key expects to be able to continue to reduce debt from available cash flow from operations and from anticipated interest savings resulting from prior and future debt reductions and future debt refinancings 
building strong customer alliances 
key seeks to maximize customer satisfaction by offering a broad range of equipment and services in conjunction with highly trained and motivated employees 
as a result  key is able to offer proactive solutions for most of the situations encountered at the wellsite 
key ensures consistent high standards of quality and customer satisfaction by continually evaluating its performance 
key maintains strong alliances with several major oil and natural gas production companies as well as several independent oil and natural gas production companies and believes that such alliances improve the stability of demand for its oilfield services 
refurbishing rigs and related equipment 
key intends to continue actively refurbishing its rigs and related equipment to maximize the utilization of its rig fleet 
the increase in cash flow  both from operations and from anticipated interest savings from reduced levels of debt  combined with the increased revolver availability  has provided ample liquidity and resources necessary to make the capital expenditures to refurbish such equipment 
training and developing employees 
key has  and will continue to  devote significant resources to the training and professional development of its employees with a special emphasis on safety 
key currently has two training centers in texas and one training center in california to improve its employees understanding of operating and safety procedures 
key recognizes the historically high turn over rate in the industry and is committed to offering compensation  benefits and incentive programs for its employees that are attractive and competitive in its industry  in order to ensure a steady stream of qualified  safe personnel to provide quality service to its customers 
major developments during fiscal industry recovery during the fourth quarter of calendar year  an imbalance began to develop in the supply and the demand for crude oil 
reduced demand was fueled by the asian recession and two consecutive unusually warm winters in north america 
the supply of crude oil increased as a result of increased production quotas by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and renewed production by iraq 
the resulting excess supply of crude oil caused significant declines in crude oil prices during calendar year and the first quarter of calendar year crude oil prices averaged to per barrel during calendar year compared to to per barrel during calendar year and reached a year low of below per barrel in december natural gas prices were also lower during the second half of calendar year as unusually warm winters in north america during calendar years and resulted in weaker demand with prices reaching a low of approximately per mcf in early calendar year reduced prices for crude oil and natural gas led to a sharp decline in the demand for oilfield services as oil and natural gas companies significantly reduced capital spending for exploration  development and production activities well into calendar year key s operations were significantly impacted by the downturn in the industry throughout fiscal  and  in response to this downturn  key reduced operating and administrative costs and delayed capital spending 
in march  opec and other non opec oil producing countries  substantially reduced production to a point which  together with improving demand for oil  caused crude oil prices to recover significantly through the spring and summer of in addition  these oil producing countries agreed to production quotas to be adjusted based on demand in order to keep crude oil prices in the range of to per barrel 
the successful implementation and subsequent adherence to these quotas  along with improving demand  have led to increased crude oil prices during fiscal with wti cushing prices averaging per barrel during such period 
in addition  domestic natural gas prices increased significantly due to increased demand during that period with nymex henry hub prices averaging per mcf during such period 
this increase in commodity prices led to a steady  sequential increase in the demand for key s services and equipment during fiscal as key s customers increased their exploration and development activity in key s primary market areas 
this increase in demand resulted in sequential increases in revenues  cash flow and net income in each quarter of fiscal over the same quarter of fiscal key expects demand for its services to remain at or above current levels as long as commodity prices remain at or near their current levels 
the level of key s revenues  cash flows  losses and earnings are substantially dependent upon  and affected by  the level of domestic and international oil and gas exploration and development activity see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition debt reduction during fiscal  key significantly reduced its long term debt and strengthened its balance sheet 
at june   key s net funded debt was approximately  and its net funded debt to capitalization was approximately as compared to approximately  and  respectively  at june  proceeds from the equity offering defined below  the production payment defined below and exercises of options and warrants  and cash flow from operations were used to accomplish this reduction in net funded debt see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition long term debt 
equity offering on june   key closed the public offering of  shares of common stock at per share  or approximately million the equity offering 
net proceeds from the equity offering were approximately million  approximately million of which was used to immediately repay a portion of key s senior credit facility term loans approximately million for the tranche a term loan and approximately million for the tranche b term loan and million of which was subsequently used to repay a portion of the senior credit facility revolver 
after these repayments  the tranche a term loan had been paid in full  the tranche b term loan had been reduced to approximately million  and the revolver had been reduced to approximately million 
the remainder of the net proceeds were used to retire other long term debt 
as a result of the equity offering  total shares outstanding as of june  were approximately million  an increase of approximately over the amount outstanding immediately prior to the equity offering see note to consolidated financial statements stockholders equity 
volumetric production payment in march  key sold a part of its future oil and natural gas production from odessa exploration incorporated odessa exploration  its wholly owned subsidiary  for gross proceeds of million pursuant to an agreement under which the purchaser is entitled to receive a share of the production from certain oil and natural gas properties in amounts ranging from  to  barrels of oil and  to  mmbtu of natural gas per month over a six year period ending february the total volume of the forward sale is approximately  barrels of oil and million mmbtus of natural gas 
the transaction is referred to elsewhere in this report as the production payment 
description of business segments key operates in three business segments which are well servicing  contract drilling and oil and natural gas production 
our operations are conducted both domestically and in argentina and canada 
the following is a description of each of these business segments for financial information regarding these business segments  see note to consolidated financial statements business segment information 
well servicing key provides a full range of well services  including rig based services  oilfield trucking services and ancillary oilfield services  necessary to maintain and workover oil and natural gas producing wells 
rig based services include maintenance of existing wells  workovers of existing wells  completion of newly drilled wells  recompletion of existing wells including horizontal recompletions and plugging and abandonment of wells at the end of their useful lives 
well service rigs key s well service rig fleet performs four major rig services to oil and natural gas operators 
maintenance services 
key estimates that there are approximately  producing oil wells and approximately  producing natural gas wells in the united states 
key provides the well service rigs  equipment and crews for maintenance services  which are performed on both oil and natural gas wells  but which are more commonly required on oil wells 
while some oil wells in the united states flow oil to the surface without mechanical assistance  most require pumping or some other method of artificial lift 
oil wells that require pumping characteristically require more maintenance than flowing wells due to the operation of the mechanical pumping equipment installed 
few natural gas wells have mechanical pumping systems in the wellbore  and  as a result  maintenance work on natural gas wells is less frequent 
maintenance services are required throughout the life of most producing natural gas and oil wells to ensure efficient and continuous operation 
these services consist of routine mechanical repairs necessary to maintain production from the well  such as repairing inoperable pumping equipment in an oil well or replacing defective tubing in a natural gas well  and removing debris such as sand and paraffin from the well 
other services include pulling the rods  tubing  pumps and other downhole equipment out of the wellbore to identify and repair a production problem 
maintenance services are often performed on a series of wells in proximity to each other and typically require less than hours per well to complete 
the general demand for maintenance services is closely related to the total number of producing oil and natural gas wells in a geographic market  and maintenance services are generally the most stable type of well service activity 
the average cost of a maintenance job typically ranges between and  excluding the costs of parts  services and other vendors at the wellsite 
workover services 
in addition to periodic maintenance  producing oil and natural gas wells occasionally require major repairs or modifications  called workovers 
workover services are performed to enhance the current production of existing wells 
such services include extensions of existing wells to drain new formations either through deepening wellbores to new zones or through drilling of horizontal lateral wellbores to improve reservoir drainage patterns 
in less extensive workovers  key s rigs are used to seal off depleted zones in existing wellbores and access previously bypassed productive zones 
key s workover rigs are also used to convert former producing wells to injection wells through which water or carbon dioxide is then pumped into the formation for enhanced recovery operations 
other workover services include major subsurface repairs such as casing repair or replacement  recovery of tubing and removal of foreign objects in the wellbore  repairing downhole equipment failures  plugging back the bottom of a well to reduce the amount of water being produced with the oil and natural gas  cleaning out and recompleting a well if production has declined  and repairing leaks in the tubing and casing 
these extensive workover operations are normally performed by a well service rig with a workover package  which may include rotary drilling equipment  mud pumps  mud tanks and blowout preventers depending upon the particular type of workover operation 
most of key s well service rigs are designed for and can be equipped to perform complex workover operations 
workover services are more complex and time consuming than routine maintenance operations and consequently may last from a few days to several weeks 
these services are almost exclusively performed by well service rigs 
the average cost of a workover project typically ranges between  and  excluding the costs of parts  services and other vendors at the wellsite  and is usually less expensive than drilling a new well 
the demand for workover services is more sensitive to expectations relating to  and changes in  oil and natural gas prices than the demand for maintenance services 
as oil and natural gas prices increase  the level of workover activity tends to increase as operators seek to increase production by enhancing the efficiency of their wells at higher commodity prices with correspondingly higher rates of return 
completion services 
key s completion services prepare a newly drilled natural gas or oil well for production 
the completion process may involve selectively perforating the well casing to access producing zones  stimulating and testing these zones and installing downhole equipment 
key typically provides a well service rig and may also provide other equipment such as a workover package  to assist in the completion process 
producers use well service rigs to complete their wells because the rigs have specialized equipment  properly trained employees and the experience necessary to perform these services 
however  during periods of weak drilling rig demand  drilling contractors may compete with service rigs for completion work 
the completion process typically requires a few days to several weeks  depending on the nature and type of the completion  and generally requires additional auxiliary equipment that can be provided for an additional fee 
the demand for well completion services is directly related to drilling activity levels  which are highly sensitive to expectations relating to  and changes in  oil and natural gas prices 
as the number of newly drilled wells decreases  the number of completion jobs correspondingly decreases 
the average cost of a completion typically ranges between  and  excluding the costs of parts  services and other vendors at the wellsite 
plugging and abandonment services 
well service rigs and workover equipment are also used in the process of permanently closing oil and natural gas wells at the end of their productive lives 
plugging and abandonment work can be performed with a well servicing rig along with wireline and cementing equipment 
the services generally include the sale or disposal of equipment salvaged from the well as part of the compensation received and require compliance with state regulatory requirements 
the demand for oil and natural gas does not significantly affect the demand for plugging and abandonment services  as well operators are required by state regulations to plug a well that it is no longer productive 
the need for these services is also driven by lease  and or operator policy requirements 
oilfield trucking key provides liquid vacuum truck services and fluid transportation and disposal services for operators whose wells produce saltwater and other fluids  in addition to oil and natural gas 
these trucks are also utilized in connection with drilling and workover projects  which tend to produce and use large amounts of various oilfield fluids 
key also owns a number of salt water disposal wells 
in addition  key provides haul equipment trucks that are used to move large pieces of equipment from one wellsite to the next 
ancillary oilfield services key provides ancillary oilfield services  which include among others hot oiling  wireline  frac tank rentals  well site construction  roustabout services  fishing and other tool rentals  supplying blowout preventers bops  and foam units and air drilling services 
demand and pricing for these services are generally related to demand for key s well service and drilling rigs 
contract drilling key provides contract drilling services to major oil companies and independent oil producers onshore the continental united states in the permian basin  the four corners region  michigan  the northeast  and the rocky mountains and internationally in argentina and ontario  canada 
drilling services are primarily provided under standard dayrate  footage or turnkey contracts 
drilling rigs vary in size and capability and may include specialized equipment 
the majority of key s drilling rigs are equipped with mechanical power systems and have depth ratings ranging from  feet to  feet for an average of approximately  feet 
oil and natural gas production key is engaged in the production of oil and natural gas in the permian basin and panhandle regions of west texas through odessa exploration 
odessa exploration manages interests in oil and natural gas producing properties for its own account and for drilling partnerships which it sponsors 
odessa exploration operates oil and natural gas wells on behalf of over working interest owners as well as for its own account 
foreign operations key also operates each of its business segments discussed above in argentina and ontario  canada 
key s foreign operations currently own well servicing rigs  oilfield trucks and seven drilling rigs in argentina and one well servicing rig  two oilfield trucks and three drilling rigs in ontario  canada 
customers key s customers include major oil and natural gas production companies  foreign national oil and natural gas production companies and independent oil and gas production companies 
no single customer in fiscal accounted for or more of key s consolidated revenues 
competition and other external factors despite the significant consolidation in the domestic well servicing industry  there are several smaller companies that compete in key s well servicing markets 
nonetheless  key believes that its performance  equipment  safety  pricing  and availability of equipment to meet customer needs and availability of experienced  skilled personnel is superior to that of its competitors 
in the well servicing markets  an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long term customer relationships is having an experienced  skilled and well trained work force 
in recent years  many of key s larger customers have placed increased emphasis on the safety records and quality of the crews  equipment and services provided by their contractors 
key has  and will continue to devote substantial resources toward employee safety and training programs 
many of key s competitors  particularly small contractors  have not undertaken similar training programs for their employees 
management believes that key s safety record and reputation for quality equipment and service are among the best in the industry 
key competes with other regional and national oil and natural gas drilling contractors  some of which have larger rig fleets with greater average depth capabilities and a few that have better capital resources than key 
management believes that the drilling industry is less consolidated than the well servicing industry  resulting in a drilling market that is more price competitive 
nonetheless  key believes that it is competitive in terms of drilling performance  equipment  safety  pricing  availability of equipment to meet customer needs and availability of experienced  skilled personnel in those regions in which it operates 
the need for oilfield services fluctuates  in part  in relation to the demand for oil and natural gas 
as demand for those commodities increases  service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers attempt to maximize the producing efficiency of their wells in a higher priced environment 
employees as of june   key employed approximately  persons approximately  in oilfield and drilling services  nine in oil and natural gas production and in corporate 
key s employees are not represented by a labor union and are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
key has not experienced work stoppages associated with labor disputes or grievances and consider its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 
environmental regulations key s oilfield service operations  oil and natural gas production and drilling activities are subject to various local  state and federal laws and regulations intended to protect the environment 
key s operations routinely involve the handling of waste materials  some of which are classified as hazardous substances 
consequently  the regulations applicable to key s operations include those with respect to containment  disposal and controlling the discharge of any hazardous oilfield waste and other non hazardous waste material into the environment  requiring removal and cleanup under certain circumstances  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years  and may in certain circumstances impose strict liability  rendering a party liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party 
such laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of  or conditions caused by  others  or for key s acts  which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the times such acts were performed 
cleanup costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws  and costs associated with changes in environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on key s financial condition 
from time to time  claims have been made and litigation has been brought against key under such laws 
however  the costs incurred in connection with such claims and other costs of environmental compliance have not had any material adverse effect on key s operations or financial statements in the past  and management is not currently aware of any situation or condition that it believes is likely to have any such material adverse effect in the future 
management believes that it conducts key s operations in substantial compliance with all material federal  state and local regulations as they relate to the environment 
although key has incurred certain costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations  such amounts have not been material to key s financial results during the past three fiscal years

item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the reform act 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements 
the following discussion provides information to assist in the understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
please note that certain reclassifications have been made to the fiscal and financial data presented below to conform to the fiscal presentation 
the reclassifications consist primarily of reclassifying as drilling revenues and expenses  revenues and expenses from the limited drilling operations conducted by certain of the company s well servicing divisions that were previously included in well servicing revenues and expenses in order to report the results of all drilling operations separately 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  versus fiscal year ended june  the company s results of operations for the year ended june  reflect the impact of the recent industry recovery resulting from increased commodity prices which in turn caused increased demand for the company s equipment and services during fiscal see part i item major developments during fiscal industry recovery 
the positive impact of this increased demand on the company s operating results was partially offset by increased operating expenses incurred as a result of the increase in the company s business activity 
the company revenues for the year ended june  increased  or  to  from  in fiscal  while net income for fiscal increased  to a net loss of  from a net loss of  in fiscal the increase in revenues is due to improved operating conditions and higher rig hours  the full year effect of the acquisitions completed during the early portion of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  higher pricing 
the decrease in net loss is the result of improved operating conditions  higher pricing  and cost reduction initiatives 
in addition  fiscal included non recurring charges for debt issuance costs and restructuring initiatives as well as higher bad debt expense 
operating revenues well servicing 
well servicing revenues for the year ended june  increased  or  to  from  in fiscal the increase was due to increased demand for the company s well servicing equipment and services  the full year effect of the acquisitions completed during the early portion of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  higher pricing 
contract drilling 
contract drilling revenues for the year ended june  increased  or  to  from  in fiscal the increase was due to increased demand for the company s contract drilling equipment and services  the full year effect of the acquisition completed during the early portion of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  higher pricing 
oil and natural gas production 
oil and natural gas production revenues for the year ended june  increased  or  to  from  in fiscal the increase was due to a increase in the price of oil and gas received on a barrel of oil equivalent boe basis in fiscal compared to fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in the volume of oil and gas produced on a boe basis 
operating expenses well servicing 
well servicing expenses for the year ended june  increased  or  to  from  in fiscal the increase in expenses is due to higher utilization of the company s well servicing equipment  higher labor costs and the overall increase in the company s well servicing business 
despite the increased costs  well servicing expenses as a percent of well servicing revenues decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal the margin improvement is due to improved operating efficiencies and the effects of higher pricing 
contract drilling 
contract drilling expenses for the year ended june   increased  or  to  from  in fiscal the increase is due to higher utilization of the company s contract drilling equipment  higher labor costs and the overall increase in the company s contract drilling business 
despite the increased costs  contract drilling expenses as a percentage of contract drilling revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the margin improvement is due to improved operating efficiencies and the effects of higher pricing 
oil and natural gas production 
oil and natural gas production expenses for the year ended june   increased  or  to  from  in fiscal the increase is due to higher production costs partially offset by lower production 
oil and natural gas production costs increased from per boe in fiscal to per boe in fiscal the increase in cost per boe is primarily due to increased costs incurred in bringing previously dormant wells back into production 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense the company s depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for the year ended june  increased  or  to  from  in fiscal the increase is due to higher capital expenditures incurred during fiscal as the company refurbished equipment and increased utilization of its contract drilling equipment which it depreciates based on utilization 
general and administrative expenses the company s general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased  or  from  to  in fiscal the increase was due to higher administrative costs necessitated by the growth of the company s operations as a result of the fiscal acquisitions and improved industry conditions 
despite the increased costs  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues declined from in fiscal to in fiscal interest expense the company s interest expense for the year ended june  increased  or  to  from  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the full year effect of the debt incurred in connection with the acquisitions completed during the early portion of fiscal  and  to a lesser extent  higher interest rates during fiscal partially offset by the impact of the long term debt reduction during fiscal bad debt expense the company s bad debt expense for the year ended june  decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to improved industry conditions for key s customers and  to a lesser extent  the centralization of the company s internal credit approval process 
extraordinary gain during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company repurchased  of its convertible subordinated notes which resulted in an after tax gain of  income taxes the company s income tax benefit for the year ended june  decreased  to  from  in fiscal the decrease in income tax benefit is due to the decrease in pretax loss 
the company s effective tax benefit rate for fiscal and was and  respectively 
the fiscal effective tax benefit rate is different from the statutory rate of because of the disallowance of certain goodwill amortization and other non deductible expenses 
the decrease in the fiscal effective tax benefit rate was due to an increase in the amount of disallowed items primarily as a result of the full year effect of the goodwill amortization of the acquisitions completed during the early portion of fiscal the company does not expect to be required to remit significant federal income taxes for the next few fiscal years because of the availability of net operating loss carryforwards from fiscal and previous years 
cash flow the company s net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended june  increased  to a positive  from a negative  in fiscal the increase is due to higher revenues resulting from increased demand for the company s equipment and services  the full year effect of the acquisitions completed during the early portion of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  higher pricing  partially offset by higher operating and general and administrative expenses resulting from increased business activity 
the company s net cash used in investing activities for the year ended june  decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal the decrease is due to no acquisitions having occurred during fiscal partially offset by higher capital expenditures 
the company s net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of significantly decreased borrowings during fiscal and  to a lesser extent  the repayment of long term debt partially offset by proceeds from the equity offering and the production payment 
fiscal year ended june  versus fiscal year ended june  the company s results of operations for the year ended june  reflect the impact of a significant and unprecedented decline in demand for the company s equipment and services in all of the company s lines of business experienced from december to march the company believes that the decline in demand for its equipment and services during fiscal was due solely to the adverse impact on its customers capital spending caused by a decline in oil prices to a twelve year low of below per barrel in december  and  to a lesser extent  a significant decline in natural gas prices see part i item major developments during fiscal industry recovery

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about key s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange risk  interest rates and oil and natural gas prices 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how key views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate risk at june   key had long term debt outstanding of  of this amount   or  bears interest at fixed rates as follows s balance at convertible subordinated notes due  senior subordinated notes due  convertible subordinated debentures due  dawson senior notes due  other rates generally ranging from to  the remaining  of debt outstanding as of june  bears interest at floating rates which averaged approximately at june  a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at june  would equal approximately basis points 
such an increase in interest rates would increase key s fiscal interest expense by approximately million assuming borrowed amounts remain outstanding 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
foreign currency risk key s net assets  net earnings and cash flows from its argentina subsidiaries are currently not exposed to foreign currency risk  as argentina s currency is tied to the us dollar 
key s net assets  net earnings and cash flows from its canadian subsidiary is based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in canadian dollars 
assets and liabilities of the canadian operations are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period 
revenues  expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
a change in the canadian to us dollar exchange rate would not be material to the net assets  net earnings or cash flows of key 
commodity price risk key s major market risk exposure for its oil and natural gas production operations is in the pricing applicable to its oil and natural gas sales 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices for natural gas 
pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years 
key periodically enters into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through commodity option or collar contracts 
key pays a premium for its option contracts 
such premiums are amortized to oil and natural gas revenues over the life of the related option contracts 
these financial hedging activities are intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage key s exposure to oil and natural gas price fluctuations 
realized gains from the settlement of these financial hedging instruments are recognized in oil and natural gas sales when the associated production occurs 
the gains and losses realized as a result of these hedging activities are substantially offset in the cash market when the hedged commodity is delivered 
as of june   key had oil and gas price collars in place  which represented  barrels of oil production per month and approximately  mmbtu of gas production per month 
the total fiscal hedged oil and natural gas volumes represent approximately and  respectively  of expected calendar year total production 
a increase in the index price of oil or gas from their levels at june  would have no impact on the company s net assets  net earnings or cash flows as derived from commodity option contracts
