the following is a discussion of factors affecting results of operations for the years ended december   and net revenues consolidated net revenues increased in to  from  in the increase was principally due to higher revenues in both the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments 
domestic revenues  which consist principally of revenues from the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments  increased to  from  in foreign revenues increased to  from  in the increase in foreign revenues resulted primarily from revenues of ost which were not in our revenues in in january   we completed the acquisition of of ost  which primarily processes  markets and distributes bovine bone tissue products for orthopaedic and dental use 
in  consolidated net revenues increased to  from  in the increase was principally due to higher revenues in both the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments 
domestic revenues increased to  from  in and foreign revenues decreased to  from  in the decline in foreign revenues in resulted primarily from decreased unit volume for our ceramic products 
grafton r dbm segment revenues increased in to  from  in revenues in this segment were higher than segment revenues of  these increases resulted from increased demand for grafton r dbm 
our grafton r dbm products have faced increasing competition as more companies have developed products with characteristics similar to grafton r dbm 
we expect that this competition will continue in the future 
base tissue segment revenues increased in to  from  in revenues in this segment were higher than segment revenues of  these increases occurred as a result of increased unit volume of allograft bone tissue processed for our clients 
during  and  two of our clients in the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments accounted for and  and and and  respectively  of consolidated net revenues 
we have exclusive processing agreements with each of these clients which expire in april  and december   respectively 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in  in and in the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in results from  i the absorption of costs associated with additional allograft tissue processing capacity which was added to meet the anticipated growth in our allograft tissue business  and ii a decline in the percentage of consolidated revenues coming from the grafton r dbm segment  which has a higher gross profit than other services and products 
the increase in gross profit in as compared with resulted primarily from an increase in the percentage of consolidated revenues represented by our grafton r dbm segment 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced construction of a new allograft tissue processing facility in eatontown  new jersey which is expected to be in use during the second half of we expect that the incremental expenses associated with the added capacity will only be partially offset by increased volume in  and therefore consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenues in is expected to decrease from the level achieved in marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative expenses increased in to  from  in marketing  general and administrative expenses were higher than marketing  general and administrative expenses of  the increase in was primarily attributable to i incremental agent commissions resulting from increased volume in the grafton r dbm segment  ii expanded marketing and promotional activities associated with the launch of two new products  the bio d tm threaded cortical bone dowel which is included in the base tissue segment and the sscs tm system  iii increased legal fees associated with patent infringement lawsuits see part i  item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements and iv the inclusion of ost s operating expenses 
we are committed to aggressively asserting and defending our technology and related intellectual property 
as a result we are currently a party in three patent lawsuits 
prosecuting and defending these lawsuits is expensive and has had  and will likely have  a negative impact on our operating results 
however  we believe it is necessary to defend our technology and related intellectual property which we invest significant amounts of money to develop 
the increase in was primarily attributable to the grafton r dbm segment and resulted from expanded marketing and promotional activities and increased agent commissions associated with increased volume 
research and development expenses consolidated research and development expenses increased in to  from  in research and development expenses in were higher than research and development expenses of  these increases were primarily attributable to increased spending in the base tissue segment associated with the continued development of a viral inactivation process for mineralized weight bearing allograft tissue  development of new allograft tissue products and ongoing support for existing products and services 
income from litigation settlement in november   we settled all claims which we had filed against depuy in the patent infringement lawsuit against gensci labs and gensci sciences see part i  item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as part of the settlement  depuy has agreed to stop selling the gensci products accused of infringing our patents no later than february  and to pay us  we received a payment of  in the fourth quarter of  of which  was recognized in income in the third quarter of and  was recognized in income in the fourth quarter of depuy will make payments of  in each quarter of these payments will be recognized in income as earned unless depuy discontinues selling the gensci products during the year  at which time depuy would not be obligated for payments beyond the quarter in which it stopped selling the gensci products 
operating income consolidated operating income increased in to  from  in consolidated operating income was higher than operating income of  the increase in both years results primarily from improved operating income in the grafton r dbm segment resulting from increased revenues and  in  the litigation settlement with depuy discussed above 
grafton r dbm segment operating income increased in to  from  in in grafton r dbm segment operating income was higher than operating income of  base tissue segment operating income increased in to  from  in primarily as a result of higher revenues 
base tissue segment operating income in was  other segment operating income declined in to a loss of  and declined in to a loss of  from a loss of  in the decline in resulted principally from increased marketing and promotional expenses associated with the launch of sscs tm  while the decline in resulted from a decrease in revenues for our ceramic products 
other income expense other income decreased  in principally due to lower interest income resulting from a decline in interest rates 
in  other income increased  due to higher invested cash and lower outstanding debt balances 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate in  and was  respectively 
the effective income tax rate exceeded the federal statutory income tax rate principally due to the impact of state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and short term investments of  compared to  at december  we invest our excess cash in us government backed securities and investment grade commercial paper of major us corporations 
working capital increased  to  at december  compared to  at december  the increase resulted primarily from increases in accounts receivable  deferred processing costs  inventories and prepaid expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased to  in from  in the decrease resulted primarily from increases in accounts receivable  deferred processing costs  inventories and prepaid expenses  partly offset by improved earnings in the increases in accounts receivable and deferred processing costs result from the growth in our grafton r dbm and base tissue segments 
the increase in inventories is associated with our acquisition of the versalok r low back fixation system see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in prepaid expenses in resulted primarily from an increase in prepaid income taxes see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash used in investing activities increased to  in from  in the increase results from i an increase in capital expenditures to  from  resulting from our continued investment in facilities and equipment needed for current and future business requirements  ii our purchase of an additional interest in ost  and iii our acquisition of the versalok r system 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced construction of a new allograft tissue processing facility in eatontown  new jersey see item properties and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the estimated aggregate cost for the construction of the facility  including furniture  fixtures and equipment  is approximately   of which will be funded through the building mortgage loan and equipment line of credit included in the credit facility concluded with our bank in june see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the remaining balance will be funded through available cash reserves or anticipated cash flow from operations 
through december  we have incurred  of capital expenditures  including capitalized interest of  related to the new allograft tissue processing facility  of which  was funded through bank financing 
net cash provided by financing activities increased to  from  in the increase results from cash proceeds received and related income tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and borrowings under the bank lines of credit 
the net cash provided by financing activities in is net of  used to repurchase and retire  shares of our common stock in in june   we replaced our then existing domestic lines of credit with a credit facility that includes a  revolving line of credit  a  building mortgage loan and a  equipment line of credit 
at december    was outstanding under the revolving line of credit and  was outstanding under the equipment line of credit 
we also have a line of credit with a dutch bank  which provides for borrowings of up to dfl  or approximately  at the december  exchange rate 
analysis of our cash position and anticipated cash flow indicated that it most likely would not be necessary to utilize a significant portion of this line of credit in and  therefore  we agreed with the bank to limit our borrowings  if any  to no more than dfl  or approximately  at the december  exchange rate 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit line 
additionally  we have a line of credit with a french bank which provides for borrowings of up to frf  or approximately  at the december  exchange rate 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit line 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   certain of our foreign based subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards aggregating  at the december  exchange rate  with no expiration date   expiring through 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and available lines of credit  together with anticipated future cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our near term requirements 
from time to time  we may seek additional funds through equity or debt financing 
however  there can be no assurance that such additional funds will be available to us or  if available  that such funds will be available to us on favorable terms 
impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of operations for the periods discussed have not been materially affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations 
litigation we are involved in various legal proceedings involving product liability and patent infringement claims 
for a complete discussion of these matters see  part i  item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of the pending litigation or as a result of the costs of contesting such lawsuits 
year we recognized the need to ensure that year issues would not adversely impact our operations and we  therefore  prior to took actions designed to minimize the risk of year issues 
we identified our potential year risk in three categories internal business software and hardware  internal non financial systems  and noncompliance by suppliers and customers 
to date  we have not experienced any year issues with our internal business software and hardware systems  non financial systems  and our suppliers and customers 
based on our experience to date we do not foresee significant risks associated with year issues at this time 
risk factors we are dependent upon two primary clients who provide the bulk of our revenues 
we are the exclusive processor of allograft bone tissue for large national and international not for profit organizations 
during  mtf and arc accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenues 
we entered into a year exclusive processing agreement with arc in december  and a five year exclusive processing agreement with mtf in april  the loss of either mtf or arc as a client or a substantial reduction in the amount of allograft bone tissue which we process for either entity would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our dependence upon a limited supply of human donors may curtail business expansion 
our allograft bone tissue processing business depends upon the availability of bone and related connective tissue from human donors recovered by our clients 
we rely on the efforts of not for profit donor procurement agencies  including our current clients  to educate the public and foster an increased willingness to donate bone tissue 
these organizations may not be able to find a sufficient number of persons to donate sufficient amounts of tissue to meet present or future demand for either allograft bone tissue or any allograft bone tissue based osteogenic materials we are developing 
our ability to secure enough donors to meet our demands could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face strong competitive threats from firms with greater financial resources and lower costs 
the allograft bone tissue we process competes in the bone graft market with autograft bone tissue  synthetic bone void fillers and allograft bone tissue processed by others  primarily tissue banks 
autograft bone tissue has traditionally been the primary choice for surgeons and we believe autograft bone tissue still maintains approximately a share of the united states bone graft market 
certain of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do 
for numerous circumstances and procedures for which autograft bone tissue transplantation is either not feasible or not desirable  there are a number of competing alternatives available  including allograft bone tissue processed by others 
in recent years  our grafton r dbm products have faced increasing competitive pressures as more companies have developed  or have announced they are developing  products with characteristics similar to grafton r dbm 
we expect that this competition will continue in the future 
many of these competitors offer a full line of metal implants and other products used in spinal surgeries 
this could give them a competitive advantage over us since they can offer surgeons a more complete line of products than we currently can 
we believe that a majority of the cadaveric bone banks operating in the united states are engaged in processing allograft bone tissue for transplantation 
substantially all of these bone tissue banks are not for profit organizations  and  as such  they may be able to supply processing services at a lower cost than we can 
we compete with such entities on the basis of our advanced processing technology and the quality and quantity of the bone tissue our processing yields 
since we introduced our allograft bone tissue processing technology in  certain competing processors have claimed to have developed technology similar to that which we use 
although we believe  based upon our knowledge of the industry  that we process bone tissue from more donors than any other processor in the world  we can not assure you that we will continue to compete successfully in the area of allograft bone tissue processing 
we are currently involved in patent litigation which could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
we may become involved in additional patent litigation in the future 
we are currently involved in three litigations involving our patents and patents held by certain of our competitors 
prosecuting and defending these lawsuits is very expensive and these expenses have had  and are likely to have  an adverse affect on our results of operations 
we are committed to aggressively asserting and defending our technology and related intellectual property which we have spent a significant amount of money to develop 
in addition  the industry in which we compete is known for having a great deal of litigation involving patents 
these factors could cause us to become involved in additional patent litigations in the future 
the expense of prosecuting or defending these future lawsuits could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we were to lose those litigations in which another party is asserting that our products infringe its patents  we would likely be prohibited from marketing those products and could also be liable for significant damages 
either or both of these results may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we lose those litigations in which we are claiming that another party s products are infringing our patents and thus  are unable to enforce our patents  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the course of the patent litigations in which we are involved  interim information about the status of each of these litigations may be released 
although these interim releases may differ from the final determinations in these litigations  such information may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
our revenues will depend upon reimbursement from public and private insurers and national health systems 
the continued ability of our clients to pay our processing charges depends upon our clients ability to distribute processed allograft bone tissue and collect fees from their clients  which are typically medical institutions 
the ability of medical institutions to pay fees to our clients depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such materials and related treatments will continue to be available from government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations 
we may have difficulty gaining market acceptance for our products and services if government and third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement 
the medical community could choose not to use our allograft bone tissue products 
we believe the market for allograft bone tissue will continue to be based upon the use of such products by physicians specializing in the orthopaedic  neurological  plastic and oral maxillofacial surgical areas 
our future growth depends in part upon such physicians wider use of allograft bone tissue as an alternative to autograft bone tissue and other available materials and treatments 
we have tried to educate physicians through our marketing activities 
although our education and marketing efforts to date have enabled us to expand our business  our future efforts in this regard may fail to generate additional demand 
governmental regulation of organ transplantation could restrict the use of our products 
in the united states the procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue are subject to federal regulation pursuant to nota  a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs  including bone and related tissue  for valuable consideration 
nota permits the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the removal  transportation  processing  preservation  quality control  implantation and storage of human bone tissue 
we provide services in all of these areas  with the exception of removal and implantation 
we and other allograft bone tissue processors are engaged in ongoing efforts designed to educate the medical community as to the benefits of processed allograft bone tissue and we will continue to expand our educational activities 
although we believe that nota permits reimbursement of these costs as costs associated with the processing  transportation and implantation of our allograft bone tissue products  our inability to be reimbursed for our education efforts in the future could adversely affect our business and prospects 
no federal agency or court has determined whether nota is  or will be  applicable to every allograft bone tissue based material which our processing technologies may generate 
assuming that nota applies to our processing of allograft bone tissue  we believe that we comply with nota  but there can be no assurance that more restrictive interpretations of  or amendments to  nota will not be adopted in the future which would call into question one or more aspects of our method of operations 
in various countries outside the united states  national laws and regulations restrict or control the availability and or use of tissues 
there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws  regulations or interpretations will not be adopted in the future which would call into question one or more aspects of our method of operations in those countries 
loss of key persons could limit our success 
our success depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and scientific and technical personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel is intense  and the loss of services of our key personnel  particularly members of senior management  could adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to enforce our patents or if it is determined that we infringe patents held by others it could damage our business 
we consider our allograft bone tissue processing technology and procedures proprietary and rely primarily on trade secrets and patents to protect our technology and innovations 
consultants employed by third parties and persons working in conjunction with medical institutions unaffiliated with us have conducted significant research and development for our products 
accordingly  disputes may arise concerning the proprietary rights to information applied to our projects which have been independently developed by such consultants or medical institutions 
in addition  you should recognize that although we have attempted to protect our technology with patents  our existing patents may prove invalid or unenforceable as to products or services marketed by our competitors 
our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents 
moreover  our existing or future products and technologies could be found to infringe the patents of others 
we are currently involved in three lawsuits in which we are accused of infringing patents held by others 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
our products face competitive threats from alternate technologies 
the primary advantage of synthetic bone substitutes as compared to allograft bone tissue is that they do not depend on the availability of human donors 
in addition  members of the medical community and the general public may perceive synthetic materials as safer than allograft based bone tissue 
the allograft bone tissue we process may be incapable of competing successfully with synthetic bone substitutes and recombinant bone growth factors which are developed and commercialized by others  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our spray coating  ha products and bovine tissue products operations face intense competition 
our plasma spray coatings  ha products and bovine tissue products operations face intense competition in europe from divisions and subsidiaries of several large corporations engaged in providing such services and products to others and from several smaller independent companies 
in addition  we also face competition from medical implant companies which have in house plasma spray coating operations 
we compete primarily on the quality of our coatings  bovine tissue products and our prices 
we believe that the spraying technology we use  which is computer controlled and utilizes robotics  enables us to provide high quality coatings at competitive prices 
you should note  however  that the industries in which we compete in europe are highly competitive  certain of our competitors have greater resources than we do  and we may be unable to compete successfully 
we may incur losses from product liability lawsuits 
the testing and use of human allograft bone tissue  bovine tissue products and the implantation of medical devices coated with our ha powder or titanium and medical devices manufactured by others and which we distribute  entail inherent risks of medical complications for patients and therefore may result in product liability claims against us 
further  our agreements with our allograft bone tissue processing clients provide for indemnification by us for liabilities arising out of defects in allograft bone tissue they distribute which is caused by our processing 
as a distributor of implants and instruments for spinal surgery  including bone screws  manufactured by ulrich  we are currently named as a defendant in one lawsuit in which patients claim that they have suffered damages from the implantation of allegedly defective spinal fixation devices 
this lawsuit is currently stayed as to us and several other defendants 
the ultimate outcome of the pending litigation or further litigation or the costs of contesting these suits could materially adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources 
we are unable to estimate the potential liability  if any  that may result from the pending bone screw litigation and  accordingly  have made no provision for any possible future liability in the consolidated financial statements 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
we presently maintain product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and per year in the aggregate 
we may be unable to maintain such insurance in the future and such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all claims made against us or all types of liabilities which may be asserted against us 
we face potential lawsuits or governmental enforcement activities based on hazardous waste we generate in our operations 
our bone tissue processing generates waste which is classified as medical hazardous waste by the united states environmental protection agency and the new jersey department of environmental protection 
we segregate such waste and dispose of it through a licensed hazardous waste transporter in compliance with applicable regulations 
the production of ha powder at our facility in the netherlands generates small amounts of hazardous waste  which we segregate and dispose of through a licensed hazardous waste transporter 
although we believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental regulations  our failure to fully comply with any such regulations could result in the imposition of penalties  fines and or sanctions or  in some cases  private lawsuits  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
