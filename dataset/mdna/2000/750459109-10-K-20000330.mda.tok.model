revenues decreased to million for from million for the decrease in revenues in was primarily caused by customers reducing orders precipitated by the effects of negative global economic conditions in the electronics market 
gross margin 
gross margin increased to for from for primarily as a result of the product mix consisting of a larger portion of higher margin product relative to lower margin product shipped  which includes products added as a result of the artic acquisition on march  additionally  fixed manufacturing costs were lower relative to higher revenue levels during the company s strategic business model is to price its products for new design wins at roughly gross margins  because the company believes this gross margin level represents the best elasticity point to maximize design wins and thus long term growth and profitability 
as such  the company expects gross margins to decline gradually over time as new design wins ramp into production 
typically  products ramp into production to months after the design win 
gross margin decreased to for from for because of an unfavorable mix of product compared to the prior year 
in addition  manufacturing costs stayed flat despite a drop in production 
the company s gross margins are heavily influenced by its oem sales relationships 
oem sales are characterized by longer product life cycles and generally lower gross margins that can vary throughout the product life cycle 
gross margins are typically lower in the early stages of production for oem sales and have the potential to improve over time 
the company establishes gross margin targets based on the nature of the sales it is pursuing and the desire to establish new oem relationships by pricing aggressively to achieve key sales 
however  many of the factors affecting gross margins  such as variances in unit volumes and timing of orders and component cost  are difficult or impossible to predict and can cause the company to be subject to unplanned margin variances 
gross margins on oem sales are also particularly sensitive to changes in customer mix because of both margin variances among individual products and the relative importance of a single large sale on overall operating results 
to mitigate the effect of short term margin variances  the company may employ step pricing techniques in which unit prices decline over the life of the product to reflect anticipated production efficiencies and or component cost reductions  or various cost sharing or cost plus pricing techniques that serve to reduce the margin risk to the company 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million for  primarily as a result of increased investment in new product development and costs of enhancements to existing products 
the company continues to invest in new design wins for oem customers and the dollar increases reflect increases in the number of employees working in research and development including additions resulting from acquisitions 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained relatively flat from to research and development expenses increased to million for from million for as a result of investment in new products

selling  general and administrative expenses  exclusive of goodwill amortization  increased to million for from million for selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in as a percentage of revenues to 
the dollar increase of million is due to the selling effort to maintain high design win activity 
the decrease as a percentage of total revenue is due to increased efficiencies in managing expenses combined with higher revenue levels  compared to selling  general and administrative expense increased to million for from million for primarily as a result of continued focus on design win success despite a decrease in revenues

year issues the company recognizes the importance to its operations of year issues and has worked to maintain the availability and integrity of its financial systems and the reliability of its operational systems 
within the last three years the company has evaluated and upgraded or replaced the software packages underlying the company s financial systems  major manufacturing systems  internal and external communication systems  and desktop systems  as appropriate  to address year readiness issues

the company has not experienced any significant year issues arising from its third party vendors to date and does not anticipate any such problems arising in the future 
in the event that problems do arise  the company continues to maintain a year contingency plan 
the total cost associated with required modifications to become year compliant has not been and is not expected to be material to the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers 
the company attempts to protect and preserve its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates and the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk 
the company pays the expenses of its international operations in local currencies 
the company s international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as they relate to operating expenses as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company in was not material
