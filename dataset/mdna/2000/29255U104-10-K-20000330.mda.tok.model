the company s customers for residential maintenance  repair and replacement services consist primarily of homeowners 
the company advertises its maintenance and repair services in the yellow pages  on billboards  on television and radio  and through direct mail 
it also relies upon unique service offerings to attract and retain customers 
janitorial group the janitorial group  which was acquired by the company in february in connection with the building one merger  offers janitorial and maintenance management services in states

the janitorial group s customers include mci worldcom  walmart  safeway  ups  trammell crow and cb richard ellis 
no single customer accounts for more than of the janitorial group s revenues 
operations in providing maintenance  repair and replacement services  the company uses specialized systems to log service orders  schedule service calls  identify and ready the necessary parts and equipment  track the work order  provide information for communication with the service technicians and customers  and prepare accurate invoices 
service histories and specific product information are generally accessible to the dispatcher in a database that may be searched by customer name or address 
maintenance  repair and replacement calls are initiated when a customer requests emergency repair service or the company calls the client to schedule periodic service agreement maintenance 
service technicians are scheduled for the call or routed to the customer s business or residence by the dispatcher via a scheduling board or daily work sheet for non emergency service or through cellular telephone  pager or radio 
service personnel work out of the company s service vehicles  which carry an inventory of equipment  tools  parts and supplies needed to complete the typical variety of jobs 
the technician assigned to a service call travels to the business or residence  interviews the customer  diagnoses the problem  presents the solution  obtains agreement from the customer and performs the work 
a portion of the company s service work is done to satisfy manufacturers equipment warranties 
for such services  the company is generally compensated by the manufacturer responsible for the defective equipment under warranty 
the company attempts to enter into service contracts whereby the customer pays an annual or semiannual fee for periodic diagnostic and preventive services 
the customers under service contracts receive priority service and specific discounts from standard prices for repair and replacement services 
commercial new installation work begins with a design request from the owner or general contractor 
initial meetings with the parties allow the contractor to prepare preliminary and then more detailed design specifications  engineering drawings and cost estimates 
once a project is awarded  it is conducted in pre agreed phases and progress billings are rendered to the owner for payment  less a retainage 
actual field work ordering of equipment and materials  fabrication or assembly of certain components  delivery of materials to the job sites  scheduling of work crews with the necessary skills  and inspection and quality control is coordinated in these same phases 
the company has established a policy to review and approve any new installation project by an operating unit that exceeds of the projected annual revenue of that unit 
the company will generally perform work contracted by it using its personnel who work from one of the commercial industrial group s locations 
however  the company may subcontract with other contractors to perform work in locations where the company does not have a facility or where the company s backlog requires additional resources 
residential service technicians may carry a customer assurance pricing manual developed by the company which specifies the labor  equipment and parts required to fulfill certain tasks and the associated flat rate prices for those tasks 
this manual is custom generated for each company from a database containing over  different repair operations and is regularly updated for price changes 
this flat rate pricing strategy allows the company to monitor margins and labor productivity at the point of sale  while increasing the level of customer satisfaction by demonstrating greater fairness and objectivity in pricing 
payment for maintenance  repair and replacement services not covered by a warranty or service contract is generally requested in cash  check or credit card at the service location 
the janitorial group assigns regional contract managers to each customer 
the contract managers determine whether to self perform work or utilize the group s existing network of cleaning companies to subcontract duties 
each of the group s three major divisions retail  commercial and industrial use the subcontractor network whenever possible because of the proven benefits reliability  quality consistency and customer preference of using the local workforce 
the janitorial group s quality measurement system measures the quality of cleaning and customer support efforts 
in addition  the group runs a call center to handle any emergency cleaning requests and has a national computer network to respond quickly and appropriately to any customer requests 
sources of supply the raw materials and components used by the company include hvac system components  ductwork  steel sheet metal and copper tubing and piping 
these raw materials and components are generally available from a variety of domestic or foreign suppliers at competitive prices 
delivery times are typically short for most raw materials and standard components  but during periods of peak demand  may extend to a month or more 
chillers for large units typically have the longest delivery time and generally have lead times of up to three to four months 
the major components of hvac systems are condensing units and chillers that are manufactured primarily by trane air conditioning company  carrier corporation  and york heating and air conditioning company 
the major suppliers of control systems are honeywell inc  johnson controls  inc 
and andover control corporation 
the company is not materially dependent on any of these outside sources 
employees the company currently has approximately  full and part time employees 
in the course of performing installation work  the company may utilize the services of subcontractors 
approximately  employees in of the company s subsidiaries are members of unions and work under collective bargaining agreements 
the collective bargaining agreements have expiration dates between april and june  the company believes that its relationship with its employees is generally satisfactory 
seasonality the company s mechanical and electrical services business tends to be affected adversely by moderate weather patterns 
comparatively warm winters and cool summers reduce the demand for its maintenance  repair and replacement services 
additionally  its new installation business is affected adversely by extremely cold weather and large amounts of rain 
as a result  the company expects that its revenues and operating results will be lower in the first and  to a lesser degree  fourth calendar quarters 
prolonged weather conditions or seasonal variations may cause unpredictable fluctuations in operating results 
backlog at december  and  the company s backlog of work was approximately million and million  respectively 
of the december  backlog  approximately million related to the company s commercial industrial operations and the remaining million related to the company s residential operations 
the company expects that during it will complete a substantial portion of the backlog as of december  competition the facility services industry is highly competitive 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the facility services industry are i timeliness  reliability and quality of services provided  ii range of services offered  iii market share and visibility and iv price 
the company believes its strategy of creating a leading national provider of comprehensive services directly addresses these factors 
the ability of the company to employ  train and retain highly motivated service technicians to provide quality services should be enhanced by its ability to utilize professionally managed recruiting and training programs 
in addition  the company expects to offer compensation  health and savings benefits that are more comprehensive than most offered in the industry 
competitive pricing is possible through purchasing economies and other cost saving opportunities that exist across each of the service lines offered and from productivity improvements 
most of the company s competitors are small  owner operated companies that typically operate in a single market 
certain of these smaller competitors may have lower overhead cost structures and may be able to provide their services at lower rates 
moreover  many homeowners have traditionally relied on individual persons or small repair service firms with whom they have long established relationships for a variety of home repairs 
there are currently a limited number of public companies focused on providing services in some of the same service lines provided by the company 
in addition  there are a number of national retail chains that sell a variety of plumbing fixtures and equipment and hvac equipment for residential use and offer  either directly or through various subcontractors  installation  warranty and repair services 
other companies or trade groups engage in franchising their names and marketing programs in some service lines 
in addition  hvac equipment manufacturers  the unregulated business segments of regulated gas and electric utilities and deregulated utilities are entering into various commercial industrial or residential service areas 
certain of the company s competitors and potential competitors have greater financial resources than the company to finance acquisition and development opportunities  to pay higher prices for the same opportunities or to develop and support their own commercial industrial or residential service operations if they decide to enter the field 
governmental regulation many aspects of the company s operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations  including  among others  permitting and licensing requirements applicable to contractors in their respective trades  building  mechanical and electrical codes and zoning ordinances  laws and regulations relating to consumer protection  including laws and regulations governing service contracts for residential services  and laws and regulations relating to worker safety and protection of human health 
in florida  warranties provided for in the company s service agreements subject the company and such agreements to some aspects of that state s insurance laws and regulations 
specifically  the company is required to maintain funds on deposit with the florida office of insurance commissioner and treasurer  the amount of which is not material to the company s business 
the company is in compliance with these deposit requirements 
the company believes it has all required permits and licenses to conduct its operations and is in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements relating to its operations 
failure of the company to comply with the applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of the company s operating permits 
a large number of state and local regulations governing the residential services trades require various permits and licenses to be held by individuals 
in some cases  a required permit or license held by a single individual may be sufficient to authorize specified activities for all the company s service technicians who work in the geographic area covered by the permit or licenses 
environmental regulation the company s operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those governing the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater  vehicle emissions and the use and handling of refrigerants 
these laws and regulations are administered by the united states environmental protection agency  the coast guard  the department of transportation and various state and local governmental agencies 
the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex and stringent  and meeting these requirements can be expensive 
the nature of the company s operations and its ownership or operation of property expose it to the risk of claims with respect to such matters  and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims 
federal and state environmental laws include statutes intended to allocate the cost of remedying contamination among specifically identified parties 
for example  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or superfund can impose strict  joint and several liability on past and present owners or operators of facilities at  from or to which a release of hazardous substances has occurred  on parties who generated hazardous substances that were released at such facilities and on parties who arranged for the transportation of hazardous substances to such facilities 
a majority of states have adopted superfund statutes comparable to  and in some cases more stringent than  cercla 
if the company were to be found to be a responsible party under cercla or a similar state statute  the company could be held liable for all investigative and remedial costs associated with addressing such contamination  even though the releases were caused by a prior owner or operator or third party 
in addition  claims alleging personal injury or property damage may be brought against the company as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances resulting from the company s operations 
prior to entering into the agreements relating to the acquisition of businesses  the company evaluated the properties owned or leased by those businesses and in some cases engaged an independent environmental consulting firm to conduct or review assessments of environmental conditions at certain of those properties 
no material environmental problems were discovered in these reviews  and the company is not otherwise aware of any actual or potential environmental liabilities that would be material to the company 
there can be no assurance that all such liabilities have been identified  that such liabilities will not occur in the future  that a party could not assert a material claim against the company with respect to such liabilities  or that the company would be required or able to answer for such claim 
the company s operations are subject to the clean air act  title vi of which governs air emissions and imposes specific requirements on the use and handling of substances known or suspected to cause or contribute significantly to harmful effects on the stratospherical ozone layer  such as chlorofluorocarbons and certain other refrigerants cfcs 
clean air act regulations require the certification of service technicians involved in the service or repair of systems  equipment and appliances containing these refrigerants and also regulate the containment and recycling of these refrigerants 
these requirements have increased the company s training expenses and expenditures for containment and recycling equipment 
the clean air act is intended ultimately to eliminate the use of cfcs in the united states and require alternative refrigerants to be used in replacement hvac systems 
the implementation of the clean air act restrictions has also increased the cost of cfcs in recent years and is expected to continue to increase such costs in the future 
as a result  the number of conversions of existing hvac systems that use cfcs to systems using alternative refrigerants is expected to increase 
the company s operations in certain geographic regions are subject to laws that will  over the next few years  require specified percentages of vehicles in large vehicle fleets to use alternative fuels  such as compressed natural gas or propane  and meet reduced emissions standards 
the company does not anticipate that the cost of fleet conversion that may be required under current laws will be material 
future costs of compliance with these laws will be dependent upon the number of vehicles purchased in the future for use in the covered geographic regions  as well as the number and size of future business acquisitions by the company in these regions 
the company cannot determine to what extent its future operations and earnings may be affected by new regulations or changes in existing regulations relating to vehicle emissions 
capital expenditures related to environmental matters during the fiscal year ended december   were not material 
the company does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its business or consolidated financial position as a result of future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment 
future events  however  such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation  more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations may require additional expenditures by the company which may be material 
item properties 
the company s executive offices are located in leased office space at greenway plaza  suite  houston  texas the company s vehicle fleet is estimated to be approximately  owned or leased service trucks  vans and support vehicles 
it believes these vehicles generally are well maintained  ordinary wear and tear excepted  and adequate for the company s current operations 
the company conducts its business from approximately facilities  substantially all of which are leased under agreements with remaining terms up to years from the date hereof on terms the company believes to be commercially reasonable 
a majority of the company s facilities are leased from certain former shareholders or entities controlled by certain former shareholders of its subsidiaries 
the provisions of the leases are on terms the company believes to be at least as favorable to the company as could have been negotiated by the company with unaffiliated third parties 
the company believes the owned and leased facilities are adequate to serve its current level of operations 
the company believes that it has generally satisfactory title to the property owned by it  subject to the liens for current taxes  liens incident to minor encumbrances and easements and restrictions that do not materially detract from the value of such property or the interests therein or the use of such property in its business 
additionally  the inventory and accounts receivable of the company and the capital stock of its subsidiaries are subject to a lien under its credit facility 
item legal proceedings 
the company is a party to various legal proceedings 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters 
however  in the opinion of management  the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders 
the company did not submit any matter to a vote of its security holders during the fourth quarter of item a
