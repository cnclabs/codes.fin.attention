we also have three network operating centers that monitor and manage network traffic hours per day  seven days per week 
acquisitions we typically enter a new market through the acquisition of an existing company within the particular market  and then further expand through a combination of organic growth supplemented by further acquisitions 
a key component of our business strategy is our continued expansion into international markets 
additionally  on november  we acquired transaction network services  inc  which we refer to as tni 
as our consolidated results included only five weeks of tni s operations  there should be a significant impact on our results of operations for the year we expect to experience increases to ecommerce revenue  data communications and operations expense and ebitda 
we continually evaluate our network operations and international organization to ensure our operations are conducted in the most efficient manner possible 
as we identify redundant or inefficient operations we may restructure the organization to increase efficiency 
such an evaluation may lead to a restructuring which could include the closing or removal of non essential equipment or facilities or selective reduction in head count 
we may incur charges in connection with such an action 
stock split on january   we announced a two for one split of our common stock that was effected on february  by means of a stock dividend to holders of record as of the close of business on january  upon completion of the stock split  we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding 
the financial statements and all references to common stock contained in this form k give retroactive effect to the stock split 
consumer business as a result of acquisitions in and  we have amassed a significant number of consumer customers throughout our operating regions 
our primary strategic focus is providing services to business and wholesale customers 
accordingly  in february we announced that in order to provide focus on our consumer business we have begun consolidating our worldwide retail consumer operations into a new retail business unit that will be run by an experienced management team and consist of nearly staff specialists in consumer sales  marketing and customer support  together with existing billing and customer support systems 
this retail unit will initially serve approximately  consumer accounts distributed throughout the top global markets mostly outside of the united states  with over localized consumer portals in more than countries 
we are currently assessing options on how to structure this business unit to maximize psinet shareholder value 
year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  results of operations all charts below are in millions of us dollars revenue 
we generate revenue from providing internet connectivity  web hosting  ecommerce services and related services to business  consumer and other isp customers 
revenue from business customers primarily arise from monthly charges for internet connectivity  ecommerce and web hosting services 
revenues from consumer customers primarily relate to services provided under wholesale arrangements which pay us a monthly charge for each customer served regardless of what each customer pays their carrier for internet access services 
other consumer revenue is derived directly from our consumer accounts 
revenue by geographic segment us latin asia india middle canada america europe pacific east africa total year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  increase percentage increase increase percentage increase latin america and india middle east africa imea were new segments in revenue by business unit access hosting ecommerce carrier and isp services services services services total year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  increase percentage increase increase percentage increase ecommerce was a new business unit in revenue growth in of consisted of organic growth ie  from businesses that were owned at the beginning of the year and from acquisitions ie  from the businesses acquired during 
revenue growth in of consisted of organic growth and acquisition growth 
our organic revenue growth is attributable to a number of factors  including the timing of acquisitions in prior years  an increase in the number of business customer and isp accounts  and an increase in the average annual revenue realized per new business customer account 
while most revenue is recurring in nature  from time to time we generate non recurring revenue from consulting and other arrangements that may or may not continue in the future 
to date  such amounts have not been material to total revenue 
our business customer account base increased in by to  business accounts from the  business accounts in  which was a increase from the  business accounts in of the total business account growth in   accounts were attributable to the existing customer base of the companies we acquired  compared to  accounts in the remaining increase was generated from organic growth 
our accounts outside the us in represented of our customer account base compared with in at the end of  our carrier and isp customers together with our small office home office soho and consumer customers  provided service to million end users 
this compares with  carrier  isp  soho and consumer customers at the end of average annual new contract value for business accounts increased from  for to  for to  for  which we believe reflects an increasing demand for value added services and higher levels of bandwidth 
our business account retention rate for both and was  which was an increase from in the reasons for the growth in access services between  and are consistent with the overall organic and acquisitive revenue growth for the company as a whole 
hosting service revenue growth between years is primarily organic and related to the increased investments made in the infrastructure behind this business unit 
ecommerce service revenue growth between and is from revenue attributable to tni  which was acquired late in carrier and isp services revenue growth between  and is almost entirely organic and relates to increases in the number of customers 
data communications and operations 
annual percentage change from prior year year amount of revenue amount percentage data communications and operations expenses consist primarily of leased long distance and local circuit costs as well as personnel and related operating expenses associated with network operations  customer support and field service 
the increases in expenses over the periods presented related principally to increases in 
our dedicated access customer account base grew to  at december  from  at december  and  at december   
dedicated customer circuit costs increased million  or from to  and million  or  from to  
backbone circuit costs increased million  or from to  and million  or  from to  
pri expenses increased million  or from to  and million  or  from to  
personnel and related operating expenses associated with network operations  customer support and field service increased million  or from to  and million  or  from to  and 
operations and maintenance charges on our bandwidth increased million  or  from to and there were no operations or maintenance charges on our bandwidth in circuit costs relating to our new and expanded pops and pris generally are incurred by us in advance of obtaining customers and resulting revenue 
historically  the organic growth of our carrier and isp customer business is highest beginning late in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of the following year due to seasonal impacts from holiday sales of computers 
in order to prepare for this demand  in addition to improving service to existing customers  we expended a considerable amount of effort during the second half of in building an inventory of pris 
as a result  our monthly direct costs in the us for pris increased from approximately million in the month of march to approximately million in the month of december based on current capacity and customer usage rates  we believe that we are able to service approximately twice as many dial up customers in the us than we currently service with these pris 
although we expect that data communications and operations expenses will continue to increase as our customer base grows  we anticipate that such expenses will continue to decrease over time as a percentage of revenue as we acquire network bandwidth under iru or capital lease agreements due to decreases in unit costs as a result of continued increases in network utilization 
network bandwidth acquired under iru or capital lease agreements is recorded as an asset and amortized over its useful life as a component of depreciation and amortization 
this will  in turn  result in an increase in the operations and maintenance expense component of data communications costs  increases in costs for other leased circuits connected to the bandwidth  as well as increases in depreciation and amortization expense over the useful life of the bandwidth  typically to years 
sales and marketing 
annual percentage change from prior year year amount of revenue amount percentage sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  advertising costs  distribution costs and related occupancy costs 
the amount increased between years due to costs associated with the expansion of our sales force internationally in conjunction with our growth and acquisitions  implementation of our newly regionalized sales and marketing organization in the us and advertising costs designed to increase awareness of the psinet brand  including costs associated with our naming rights and sponsorship agreements for psinet stadium with the baltimore ravens of the national football league and the launch of a television advertising campaign during national football league television broadcasts 
however  as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expense should continue to decrease 
general and administrative 
annual percentage change from prior year year amount of revenue amount percentage general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and occupancy costs for executive  financial  legal and administrative personnel and provision for uncollectible accounts receivable 
the increase in over resulted from general and administrative expenses of companies acquired and from the growth of our business  in particular  our organic growth and the addition of management staff and other related operating expenses across our organization 
we are finalizing plans to consolidate most of our virginia locations into one facility 
as a result  various costs associated with the termination of various facility leases and the relocation of employees are likely to be incurred in the first half of the increase in over resulted from the addition of management staff and related operating expenses across the organization  including in conjunction with our expansion outside of the united states  and increase in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable 
these expenses were in part offset by decreased expenses following the sale of certain business units in while general and administrative expenses should continue to increase in amount as we continue to develop our infrastructure and our organizations to manage a global business  such costs should decrease as a percentage of revenue due to achieving greater economies of scale 
depreciation and amortization 
annual percentage change from prior year year amount of revenue amount percentage depreciation and amortization costs have increased both in amount and as a percentage of revenue as a result of capital expenditures associated with network infrastructure enhancements  including telecommunications bandwidth acquisitions  and depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets related to business acquisitions 
for  million related to depreciation of fixed assets  and approximately million related to amortization of intangibles 
for  approximately million related to depreciation of fixed assets  and approximately million related to amortization of intangibles 
for  expenses were primarily related to depreciation of equipment 
our depreciation and amortization expenses will increase significantly as a result of our acquisition of network bandwidth under iru or capital lease agreements  and from tangible and intangible assets related to business combinations and expansion of our operations 
in connection with finalizing our plans to consolidate most of our virginia locations into one facility  the useful lives of certain of our assets will be reassessed and may be shortened over the next two quarters 
acquired in process research and development 
annual percentage change from prior year year amount of revenue amount percentage a portion of the value of various acquisitions in and was attributed to in process research and development  which must be expensed immediately 
the charges were quantified by means of independent valuations and reflect technologies acquired prior to technological feasibility and for which there was no alternative future use 
we have included a detailed description as of the respective acquisition dates of the specific technologies acquired  their value  cost to complete  expected completion date and remaining tasks  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this form k 
interest expense 
annual percentage change from prior year year amount of revenue amount percentage interest expense has increased due to the issuance of our senior notes in april  our senior notes in november  our senior notes in july and our senior notes in december  as well as to increased borrowings and capital lease obligations incurred to finance our network expansion and to fund our working capital requirements 
interest expense is directly related to our borrowings 
interest expense will increase in absolute dollar terms in based on a full year of interest expense on our borrowings 
future increases in interest expense will depend on our capital needs and its financing decisions 
interest income 
annual percentage change from prior year year amount of revenue amount percentage interest income has increased due to interest received on the net proceeds of our various financing activities during and  which we invest in short term investment grade and government securities until such time as we use them for other purposes 
non recurring arbitration charge 
the results for include a million charge for an arbitration award and related costs 
there were no similar charges in or net loss available to common shareholders and loss per share 
net loss available to percentage percentage basic and common of change from diluted loss year shareholders revenue prior year per share the primary reasons for the change in net loss available to common shareholders were 
an increase of return to preferred shareholders  
operating losses of acquired companies  
the increase in data communications costs  including expenditures for dial up circuits eg  pris  
acquisitions of fiber based and satellite telecommunications bandwidth  leading to an increase in depreciation  personnel and other operating costs to manage the bandwidth  
an increase in depreciation and amortization related to acquisitions  
an increase in charges for acquired in process research and development  
an increase of return to preferred shareholders  
an increase in net interest expense due to the issuance of our senior notes  and 
the non recurring arbitration charge in the return to preferred shareholders is subtracted from net loss in determining the net loss available to common shareholders 
because inclusion of common stock equivalents is antidilutive  basic and diluted loss per share are the same in each period presented 
segment information we offer a broad range of internet access services and related products to businesses in the us and throughout the world 
as of december   we served primary markets in countries  with operations organized into five geographic operating segments us canada  latin america  europe  asia pacific and india middle east africa 
in measuring performance and allocating assets  the chief operating decision maker reviews each geographic operating segment as a whole and not by types of services provided 
we evaluate the performance of our operating segments and allocate resources to them based on revenue and ebitda  which we define as losses before interest expense and interest income  taxes  depreciation and amortization  other non operating income and expense  and charge for acquired in process research and development 
operations of the us canada segment include shared network costs and corporate functions that we do not allocate to our other geographic segments for management reporting purposes 
capital expenditures include both assets acquired for cash and financed through capital lease and seller financed arrangements 
revenue by operating segment is provided on the basis of where services are provided 
we had no single customer representing greater than of our revenues 
key changes in the metrics we report in our segment disclosure footnote are as follows us latin asia india canada america europe pacific middle total east africa revenue growth ytd to ytd revenue growth ytd to ytd revenue growth ytd to ytd ebitda growth ytd to ytd ebitda growth ytd to ytd ebitda growth ytd to ytd ebitda as of revenue ytd ebitda as of revenue ytd ebitda as of revenue ytd asset growth ytd to ytd asset growth ytd to ytd  asset growth ytd to ytd capital expenditures growth ytd to ytd us latin asia india middle canada america europe pacific east africa total capital expenditures growth ytd to ytd   capital expenditures growth ytd to ytd capital expenditures as of revenue ytd capital expenditures as of revenue ytd capital expenditures as of revenue ytd latin america and india middle east africa are new segments in all of our operating segments have experienced significant changes in revenue  ebitda  assets and capital expenditures during and due to our organic growth  to increases in the number of our acquisitions primarily outside of the us and to expansion of investments in our network as described elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our loss from operations differs from ebitda only by depreciation and amortization and charges for acquired in process research and development  therefore  loss from operations in each segment reflects the same underlying trends as those impacting ebitda as a percentage of revenue 
liquidity and capital resources we historically have had losses from operations  which have been funded primarily through borrowings and capital lease financings from vendors  financial institutions and other third parties  and through the issuances of debt and equity securities 
in  we received net proceeds of approximately billion from debt and equity financings 
at december   we had billion of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities  including restricted amounts 
cash flows for the year ended december   and cash flows used in operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period depending upon the timing of operating cash receipts and payments and other working capital changes  especially accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets  and accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
in all three years our net losses were the primary component of cash used in operating activities  offset by significant non cash depreciation and amortization expenses relating to our network and intangible assets and charges for acquired in process research and development 
operating cash flows in also include the million arbitration award payment 
cash flows used in investing activities were billion  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
investments in certain businesses resulted in the use of million of cash for the year ended december   net of cash acquired 
investments in our network and facilities during resulted in total additions to fixed assets of million 
of this amount  million was financed under vendor or other financing arrangements  million of non cash additions related to the oc bandwidth acquired from ixc internet services  inc ixc  million related to other network facilities that remained in accounts payable at year end  and million was expended in cash including payment of million for other network facilities that remained in accounts payable at december  for the year ended december   total additions were million  of which million was financed under equipment financing agreements  million of non cash additions related to the oc bandwidth acquired from ixc  million related to other network facilities that remained in accounts payable at december   and million was expended in cash 
for the year ended total additions were million  of which million was financed under equipment financing agreements and million was expended in cash 
purchases of short term investments during were an aggregate of billion  offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of short term investments of billion 
purchases of short term investments during were an aggregate of million offset by the sale and maturity of short term investments of million 
investing cash flows in and were increased by million and decreased by million  respectively  from changes in restricted cash and short term investments related to various financing and acquisition activities 
cash flows provided by financing activities were billion  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we received billion of net proceeds from the issuance of notes payable and million from equity offerings 
in and  we received net proceeds from the issuance of notes payable of billion and million  respectively 
we made repayments aggregating million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  on our lines of credit  capital lease obligations and notes payable 
during the year ended december    and  we received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million  million and million  respectively 
capital structure our capital structure at december  consisted of senior notes  capital lease obligations  convertible preferred stock and common stock 
total borrowings at december  were billion  which included million in current obligations and billion in long term debt  capital lease obligations and notes payable 
as of december   million was available for purchases of equipment and other fixed assets under various lease financing arrangements  after designating million of payables for various equipment purchases that we intend to finance under these agreements 
at december   we had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  billion aggregate principal amount and euro million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  and million aggregate principal amount and euro million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due at december  we had on deposit in an escrow account restricted cash and short term investments of million to fund  when due  the next two semi annual interest payments on the senior notes 
the indentures governing each of the senior notes contain many covenants with which we must comply relating to  among other things  the following matters 
a limitation on our payment of cash dividends  repurchase of capital stock  payment of principal on subordinated indebtedness and making of certain investments  unless after giving effect to each such payment  repurchase or investment  certain operating cash flow coverage tests are met  excluding certain permitted payments and investments

a limitation on certain mergers  consolidations and sales of assets by us or our subsidiaries  
a limitation on certain transactions with our affiliates  
a limitation on the ability of any of our subsidiaries to guarantee or otherwise become liable with respect to any of our indebtedness unless such subsidiary provides for a guarantee of the senior notes on the same terms as the guarantee of such indebtedness  
a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions by us or our subsidiaries  
a limitation on certain issuances and sales of capital stock of our subsidiaries  and 
a limitation on the ability of us or our subsidiaries to engage in any business not substantially related to a telecommunications business 
at december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
in may  we completed an offering of  shares of our common stock at per share for net proceeds of approximately million  after expenses 
in may  we completed a public offering of  shares of our series c cumulative convertible preferred stock series c preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately million after expenses excluding amounts paid by the purchasers of the series c preferred stock into the series c deposit account described below 
the series c preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share

holders of series c preferred stock received quarterly interest payments from the series c deposit account of approximately million on each of august   november  and february  the funds placed in the series c deposit account by the purchasers of the series c preferred stock will  together with the earnings on those funds  be sufficient to make payments  in cash or stock  through may  see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the deposit account and other features of this stock 
in february and march  we exchanged  newly issued shares of our common stock for an aggregate of  shares of our series c preferred stock through individually negotiated transactions with a limited number of holders of the series c preferred stock 
the implied premium of approximately million incurred in connection with the exchanges  net of cash received from the deposit account relating to the exchanged shares  will be recognized as a return to preferred shareholders in the first quarter of subsequent to the exchange  we converted the exchanged series c preferred stock into  shares of our common stock  which we hold as treasury shares 
in february  we completed an offering of  shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock series d preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million after expenses excluding amounts paid by the purchasers of the series d preferred stock into the deposit account described below 
the series d preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share 
at closing  the purchasers of the series d preferred stock deposited approximately million into an account established with a deposit agent the series d deposit account

holders of series d preferred stock will receive quarterly payments from the series d deposit account commencing may  and continuing until february  the funds placed in the series d deposit account by the purchasers of the series d preferred stock will  together with the earnings on those funds  be sufficient to make payments  in cash or stock  from the issue date through february  see note to our consolidated financial statements for information on the deposit account and other features of this stock 
commitments  capital expenditures and future financing requirements in order to maintain our competitive position  enhance our capabilities as an internet super carrier and continue to meet the increasing demands for service quality  availability and competitive pricing  we expect to make significant capital expenditures including for developing hosting centers 
at december   we were obligated to make future cash payments that total million for acquisitions of global fiber based and satellite telecommunications bandwidth  including irus or other rights 
we also expect that there will be additional costs  such as connectivity and equipment charges  in connection with taking full advantage of such acquired bandwidth and irus 
certain of this fiber based and satellite telecommunications bandwidth may require the acquisition and installation of equipment necessary to access and light the bandwith in order to make it operational 
we currently believe that our capital expenditures in will be substantially greater than those in and that  as a result of the completion of our recent debt and equity offerings  our capital expenditure program will be accelerated 
for the year ended december   our total capital expenditures were million  of which million was in cash 
for the year ending december   we expect our capital expenditures will be approximately billion  which we expect to come from a combination of cash on hand and through vendor and other lease financing 
in february  we announced the launch of psinet ventures  a new corporate venture program 
with a combination of cash investments and the exchange of services for equity  psinet ventures will partner with innovative internet entrepreneurs through direct minority equity investments  typically during early and mid stage financing 
our investments are typically in businesses that are accounted for as cost investments 
we will focus globally on application service providers asps  content service providers csps  ecommerce providers  internet infrastructure providers  incubators  and other emerging opportunities that enhance psinet s financial and competitive technology and service positions 
we expect to structure certain of these arrangements as new start up companies to allow them to purchase any psinet service  including managed web hosting and virtual internet service provider visp services  in exchange for equity rather than cash 
this program will be funded with approximately billion  which includes the value of current investments and the value of internet services for future investments as well as million in cash 
as of december   we had commitments to certain telecommunications vendors under operating lease agreements totaling million payable in various years through additionally  we have various agreements to lease office space  facilities and equipment and  as of december   we were obligated to make future minimum lease payments of million under those non cancelable operating leases expiring in various years through for certain acquisitions  we have retained a portion of the purchase price under holdback provisions of the purchase agreements to secure performance by certain sellers of indemnification or other contractual obligations of the sellers 
these holdback amounts are generally payable up to months after the date of closing of the related acquisitions 
acquisition holdback amounts totaled million at december   the majority of which is reported in other liabilities 
in connection with our previously announced naming rights and sponsorship agreements with the baltimore ravens of the national football league  we will make payments over the next years totaling approximately million 
we presently believe  based on the flexibility we expect to have in the timing of orders of bandwidth  in outfitting our pops with appropriate telecommunications and computer equipment  and in controlling the pace and scope of our anticipated buildout of our international data communications network and ecommerce hosting centers  that we will have a reasonable degree of flexibility to adjust the amount and timing of such capital expenditures in response to our then existing financing capabilities  market conditions  competition and other factors 
accordingly  we believe that working capital generated from the use of acquired bandwidth  together with other working capital  from capital lease financings  from the proceeds of our recent debt and equity offerings and from future equity or debt financings  which we presently expect to be able to obtain when needed  will be sufficient to meet the currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements of our operations 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will have access to sufficient additional capital and or financing on satisfactory terms to enable us to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
we regularly review our capital commitments and needs and the availability of financing through institutional sources and the capital markets 
we expect to pursue opportunities to raise additional capital from time to time as we determine to be advisable based upon our capital needs  financing capabilities and market conditions 
other possible strategic relationships and acquisitions we anticipate that we will continue to seek to develop relationships with strategic partners  both domestically and internationally  and to acquire assets  including  without limitation  additional telecommunications bandwidth  and businesses and make investments including venture capital investments principally relating to or complementary to our existing businesses 
certain of these strategic relationships may involve other telecommunications companies that desire to enter into joint marketing and services arrangements with us pursuant to which we would provide internet and internet related services to such companies 
such transactions  if deemed appropriate by us  may also be effected in conjunction with an equity or debt investment by such companies in us or vice versa 
such relationships and acquisitions may require additional financing and may be subject to the consent of our lenders and other third parties 
derivatives and foreign currency exposure we have not entered into any financial instruments to serve as hedges against certain financial and currency risks or for trading 
however  as a result of the recent increase in our foreign operations and the issuance of our euro denominated senior notes  we may begin to use various financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments  in the ordinary course of business  for purposes other than trading 
these instruments could include letters of credit  guarantees of debt  interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency exchange contracts relating to intercompany payables of foreign subsidiaries 
we do not intend to use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange contracts would be used to mitigate foreign currency exposure and with the intent of protecting the us dollar value of certain currency positions and future foreign currency transactions 
interest rate swap agreements would be used to reduce our exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
by their nature  all such instruments would involve risk  including the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 
we would attempt to control our exposure to counterparty credit risk through monitoring procedures and by entering into multiple contracts 
year prior to entering the year  or yk  we developed detailed plans for implementing  testing and completing any necessary modifications to our key computer systems and equipment with embedded chips to ensure that they were yk compliant 
we also developed a test bed of our us internal systems to implement and complete testing of the requisite minor changes and completed an inventory of our internal systems that we use outside of the united states to determine the status of their yk compliance 
now that we have entered the year  we have tested our key computer systems and to date  we have not encountered any material yk related disruptions or failures of our systems or services  nor have we been notified of any disruptions or failures in the systems of any of our third parties with whom we deal 
there is an ongoing risk that yk related problems could still occur and we will continue to evaluate these risks 
however  we believe that the yk issue will not pose any significant operational problems for us
