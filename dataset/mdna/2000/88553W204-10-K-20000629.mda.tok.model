cost of software publishing revenues consists primarily of direct costs associated with software titles  including manufacturing costs and royalties payable to platform developers such as sony and nintendo and  to a lesser extent  royalties payable to third party developers 
cost of revenues for interactive entertainment software varies significantly by platform 
cost of revenues for video game console titles is typically higher than cost of revenues for personal computer titles due to relatively higher manufacturing and royalty costs associated with these products 
cost of revenues for personal computer titles primarily consists of the cost of the cd rom and packaging 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and support costs 
internal development costs of software titles are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expenses 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and retail marketing support  sales commissions  sales and marketing personnel costs and other costs 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures to develop our business in the future 
we expect that our operating results will fluctuate as a result of a wide variety of factors  including the factors described in risk factors 
as of march   we had cumulative federal net operating loss carryforwards of million for federal income tax purposes  which if not offset against future taxable income  will expire in fiscal through as of march   we had no cumulative california net operating loss carryforwards

net interest and other income 
software publishing has incurred negative cash flows during fiscal and  and we primarily have relied upon cash generated from the sale or license of hardware systems technology to fund software publishing operations 
see notes g and h of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for presentation purposes all net interest and other income expense has been allocated to software publishing 
net interest and other income decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in net interest and other income is primarily due to the decrease in cash and short term investment balances 
hardware systems in fiscal  we licensed and sold substantially all of the assets of our former hardware systems group 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital was million as of march  compared to million as of march  our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investment balances  which were million at march  and million at march  the increase was primarily due to the million net cash receipt from the secondary offering  offset by million cash used in operating activities and million in capital expenditure 
in fiscal  we entered into two line of credit agreements 
our agreement with coast business credit allows us to borrow up to million or of qualified accounts receivable 
borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at a rate of prime plus as of march  
this line of credit expires in march our agreement with coast business credit contains financial covenants 
see note n of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
as of march   our outstanding loan balance under this facility was million 
our agreement with merrill lynch co 
allows us to borrow up to million or of the cash balance in the pledged collateral account 
borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at a rate of the day commercial paper rate plus as of march  
the merrill lynch line of credit was terminated in april in august  we completed a public offering of our common stock  raising approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
we anticipate that the net proceeds of the public offering of our common stock  cash receipts from sales of products  and available borrowings under our credit facilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we expect to incur negative cash flows for the fiscal  primarily due to our continued investment in the internal development of entertainment software titles for the next generation console platforms that are scheduled to be released in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  which include additional capital expenditures primarily for computer equipment 
in addition  we anticipate that a substantial portion of our operating expenses in fiscal will be related to marketing and advertising  as we continue to raise the brand awareness of our products 
due to our aggressive expansion plan  additional capital may be required in fiscal if we need to raise additional funds through public or private financing  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available or that  if available  it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
additional financing may result in substantial and immediate dilution to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available to satisfy either short or long term capital requirements  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to seek funds through arrangements with strategic partners or other parties that may require us to relinquish material rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets 
year compliance as of june   we had not experienced any year related disruption in the operation of our systems 
although most year problems should have become evident on january   additional year related problems may become evident only after that date 
if our computers fail to recognize and properly process data related to the year  they may cause many computer software applications to fail or reach erroneous results 
any failure by us  our third party suppliers or customers to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain of our business operations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
we classify our cash equivalents and short term investments as fixed rate if the rate of return on such instruments remains fixed over their term 
these fixed rate investments include fixed rate us government securities  municipal bonds  time deposits and certificates of deposit 
we classify our cash equivalents and short term investments as variable rate if the rate of return on such investments varies based on the change in a predetermined index or set of indices during their term 
these variable rate investments primarily include money market accounts held at various securities brokers and banks 
short term investments are included in the restricted cash line item on the balance sheet 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of our investment portfolio at march  average short term investments interest rate cost fair value fixed rate   see definition in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
the aggregate fair value of the our investment in short term investments as of march   by contractual maturity date  consisted of the following aggregate fair value in thousands due in one year or less  due in one to three years
