our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
factors that might cause those differences include those set forth under risk factors 
company overview we were incorporated in july as onsale  inc old onsale and began auctioning products on the internet in may for the period from july to december   our operating activities related primarily to recruiting personnel  purchasing operating assets  establishing vendor relationships and developing the computer infrastructure necessary to conduct live auctions on the internet 
during that period  old onsale had total revenue of  old onsale achieved profitability in the first quarter of and we increased our total revenue and net income in each quarter of in early we expanded our operations and increased our staffing and marketing efforts  which resulted in higher operating expenses and net losses in  and in january we introduced our onsale atcost program  under which we sold computers and computer related products at prices equal to the amount invoiced by our vendors  plus charges for transaction  payment processing and shipping fees  and taxes where appropriate 
in november we acquired egghead 
com  inc old egghead 
in connection with that merger we changed our name to egghead 
com  inc egghead 
old egghead was based in vancouver  washington and had approximately employees as of november  in connection with the merger we issued approximately million shares of our common stock in exchange for all the outstanding shares of old egghead and converted outstanding options to purchase old egghead common stock into options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock

the operations of old egghead for the three month period ended march   resulting in net sales and a net loss of and million  respectively  have been included in the results of operations for the years ended december  and the following discussion relates to the consolidated financial statements of the combined company  egghead 
business overview we are an internet retailer selling retail and wholesale goods to businesses  resellers and consumers 
we sell merchandise online through our superstore and auction and smart deals pages on our web site 
superstores 
through the superstores  we offer businesses  resellers and consumers a broad selection of new  current version computers and related products 
old egghead operated its superstores from the first quarter of  selling the products at a low margin 
in january we introduced our superstore  onsale atcost  where we sold products at prices equal to the amount invoiced by our vendors  plus charges for payment processing  shipping and handling and sales tax where appropriate 
effective with the merger  we sell products at competitive prices through our superstores 
auctions and smart deals 
through auctions and smart deals  we sell excess merchandise and services  including refurbished and close out products 
merchandise and services that we offer on these web pages include computers and related products  sports and fitness equipment  consumer electronics  and vacation and travel packages 
we also derive revenues from commissions on goods sold through our online auctions 
in addition  old egghead sold merchandise through retail stores and a catalog mail order division  until such operations were closed down in february results of operations the following table summarizes our selected results from continuing operations for the three years ended december  the operating results in any periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period

   revenue our revenue consists of online revenue  retail revenue through february  and commission and other revenue 
online and retail revenue consists of sales of merchandise and services  net of returns 
online revenue represents sales of merchandise acquired on a purchase or consignment basis where we charge the customer s credit card and either we or the vendor ships the merchandise to the customer 
retail revenue represents sales through old egghead tradition stores and catalog mail order operations  which were closesd in period 
commission and other revenue consists of commissions on auction sales of supplier s products where the supplier charges the customers credit card  maintains title to the inventory and ship the products and advertising revenue from vendors and other businesses 
for more detailed description of our sources of revenue  the risks that we bear under each revenue model and the recognition of revenue for each  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sources of revenue growth 
online revenue increased million  or  for the year ended compared with  and million  or  for the year ended compared with the increases in online revenue from to were attributable primarily to the following factors growth of our online customer base due primarily to investments in marketing programs designed to promote and maintain awareness of our brand  the opening of our onsale atcost web site in january  increases in the amounts and types of merchandise obtained from vendors for sale over our superstore and auction web pages  including increases in the categories and variety of products that we offer  increased daily and weekly auctions  and the introduction of new auction services such as quick buy and express auctions 
retail revenue was million in and in and as all of old egghead s retail stores were closed by february commission and other revenue increased from to primarily due to increased advertising revenue 
from to  the increase in advertising revenue was offset by a decrease in old egghead s installation and other service commission revenues generated by its retail stores  which were being closed during the applicable period 
constraints on revenue growth 
our ability to grow revenue may be constrained by our inability to obtain product from vendors who supply product for our auction and smart deals sales  the unavailability of high demand product sold through our superstores  and our desire to increase product margins 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  growth in online revenue was constrained due to a limited supply of inventory available from our computer products vendors for our auction and smart deals web pages 
superstore sales are currently constrained due to the unavailability of high demand product and our efforts to increase product margin 
we cannot assure you these types of revenue growth constraints will lessen in future quarters 
superstores vs 
auctions and smart deals 
for the year ended december   revenue from our online superstores constituted of our total revenue  and revenue from our auction and smart deal web pages constituted of our total revenue 
for the comparable period in  revenue from our superstores and auction and smart deal web pages were and  respectively  of our total revenue 
the increase in superstore revenue as a percentage of total revenue was due to the opening of our onsale atcost web site in january and an increase in sales in the old egghead superstore 
gross profit gross profit is total revenue minus cost of revenue 
cost of online revenue consists of the cost of the merchandise sold to customers  inventory reserve adjustments and net shipping shipping and handling revenue minus shipping costs 
gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of revenue 
gross margin for online revenue was  and  respectively  for the years ended  and the decrease in gross margin from to reflects a general decrease in selling prices of computers and related merchandise  lower margins associated with auction and smart deals merchandise and our introduction of the onsale atcost web site in january which sales generally produce lower margins than auction and smart deals direct sales 
the decrease in margins associated with auction merchandise resulted from our efforts to increase auction sales and market share by increasing the quantities of products available for bid at any one time  which tends to lower final sales prices 
additionally  we conducted an aggressive marketing campaign associated with onsale atcost sales in which  for most of the second and fourth quarters of  we waived fees charged for transaction processing and shipping 
we also offered promotional pricing on specific products to compete with prices offered by our competitors 
the decrease in gross margin from to was primarily attributable to industry wide pricing pressure related to both competitors and vendors pricing of computer products 
gross margin for retail revenue decreased in connection with the closure of the retail stores 
we expect that gross margin will continue to be challenged as we face ongoing industry wide competitive price pressures and continue our efforts to maintain or increase our market share 
some competitors are selling current version goods that are in high demand at or below the cost of the products 
we have responded to these competitive pressures by reducing the selling prices on some of our products 
generally  in an effort to increase our market share  we plan to enhance our customer service operations  continue to make promotional offerings  and extend credit to certain business customers 
in addition  we may waive all or part of the shipping and handling fee for limited periods of time 
operating expenses our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  excluding merger and restructuring and impairment costs  were  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
these expenses reflected the cost of operating two separate businesses prior to the merger with old egghead 
additionally  operating expenses prior to included the expense of operating the retail stores as well as the operating expenses related to the online portion of our business 
we believe that our operating expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenue due to the elimination of duplicate operations in the combined company 
we expect to maintain a high level of spending to expand our operations and promote our brand name 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenditures  payroll and related expenses for sales  customer service  marketing and merchandise acquisition personnel  distribution and credit card processing costs 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to increased spending on radio  print and online marketing and advertising programs  including marketing of our onsale atcost site 
additionally  we expanded our customer service department during sales and marketing expense in and primarily reflects online advertising and sales and marketing personnel related to our online business 
in and  a significant portion of the sales and marketing expense consisted of advertising and personnel costs to support old egghead s retail stores 
we will continue to invest heavily in the marketing area to enhance our brand recognition through our marketing and advertising programs  although we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as we combine advertising spending for a single combined company 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for executive  accounting and administrative personnel  bad debt expense  facilities expenses  recruiting and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and  respectively  for the three years ended  and the decrease from to was due to leveraging relatively fixed expenses with a higher volume of sales 
the expense reflects increased hiring to support the online business for old egghead and onsale 
general and administrative expense in includes expenses for personnel to support our online business and  for old egghead  significant expense to support its retail store business 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue also increased in because the online sales increase from to did not fully offset the decrease in retail store sales 
we expect the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses to decrease in due to the elimination of duplicate operations in the combined company 
in  old egghead reduced its ownership interest in its wholly owned subsidiary  elekom  to and began using the equity method of accounting for that entity 
the general and administrative expenses in included million associated with elekom prior to the reduction in ownership 
the remaining interest in elekom was sold in november engineering 
engineering expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for engineering personnel and consultants who develop  enhance  manage  operate and monitor our web site and related systems  as well as related equipment costs  other than those capitalized in accordance with sop engineering expenses as a percentage of revenue were in  in and in the decrease in was due to leveraging the partially fixed expenses with higher sales 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to increased staffing and associated costs relating to enhancing the features and functionality of our web sites and related systems  especially as old egghead moved from a retail store to an online operation 
prior to  all engineering costs were expensed as incurred 
in  we adopted the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop and  accordingly  capitalized certain engineering costs related to internally developed software 
during we capitalized approximately million of software of which million was related to engineering costs for internally developed software 
during  we capitalized approximately million of software of which million was related to internally developed software 
during the fourth quarter of  we wrote off old egghead capitalized software totaling approximately million  net of accumulated depreciation 
see merger related costs section below 
we expect the dollar amount of engineering expenses to remain relatively constant in and to increase over time as we add staff to maintain  enhance and modify our web site and other systems 
merger related costs 
in connection with the acquisition of old egghead  we recorded merger related expenses of approximately million during these expenses include investment banking and financial advisory fees of approximately million and other merger related expenses of million  consisting primarily of professional services  severance costs  contract termination costs and other merger related expenses 
we also wrote off assets representing duplicate facilities including hardware and software of approximately million and goodwill of million associated with these duplicate facilities 
we also expect to incur approximately million of additional costs through the first quarter of as additional severance benefits are earned by our employees and additional merger related expenses are incurred 
restructuring and impairment charges 
restructuring income in reflects the change in management s estimate of costs remaining to complete the closure of old egghead s retail network  which is substantially complete 
these changes in estimates primarily related to the resolution of certain lease obligations for former retail facilities 
additionally  in the first calendar quarter of  old egghead announced plans to move the remaining headquarters functions from liberty lake  washington to vancouver  washington and recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  related to the move 
this restructuring charge was offset by a reduction of approximately the same amount in restructuring reserves 
the obligations were substantially settled by the end of the restructuring and impairment charges were related to the closure of the remaining stores in old egghead s retail store network  a significant reduction in headquarters staff and the closure of the sacramento distribution center 
overall  these charges totaled million before income taxes  and consisted of million for retail lease terminations and related fixed asset disposals  million for store close out operating costs  million for the liquidation of inventory  million for closure of the sacramento distribution facility and million for severance  fixed asset disposals and other miscellaneous expenses related to the reduction of the headquarters operations 
these charges were recorded as a million charge to gross profit  a million charge to selling and marketing expenses  a  charge to general and administrative expenses and a million charge to restructuring and impairment charges 
the million restructuring and impairment charge was partially offset by a reduction of million in restructuring and impairment reserves 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
equity in net loss of joint venture on may   we entered into a joint venture agreement with softbank corporation to perform on line auctions for the japanese market  resulting in the formation of onsale japan kk  which commenced operations in the third quarter of we own a interest in the joint venture and account for our interest using the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  we recognize our share of net profits or losses of the joint venture as an adjustment to our initial investment amount 
our share of the net loss of the joint venture was million in and  during interest and other income  net our interest and other income  net  was  and million in  and  respectively 
the income included increased interest earned on higher cash balances due to the secondary offering of old egghead common stock in march  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million  partially offset by decreased cash balances resulting from net losses and increased purchases of merchandise inventory 
the income includes a gain of million from the sale of all of old egghead s equity interest in elekom corporation in november  and interest earned on increased cash balances resulting from the initial and secondary public offerings of onsale common stock in april and october  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately and million  respectively 
income taxes we had net losses in  and  and therefore we did not record any provision for income taxes in those years 
discontinued operations all results of operations of the corporate  government and educational sales division are reported as discontinued operations 
expenses included in the results of the discontinued operations reflect only those activities directly related to the corporate  government and educational sales division 
income from operations of the corporate  government and educational sales division during reflects final adjustments on the settlement and disposition of this division s related liabilities and assets of million 
liquidity and capital resources cash inflows and outflows financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in primarily consists of the issuance of old egghead common stock in a secondary public offering in march  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million and proceeds from stock issuances under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in resulted primarily from net proceeds of million from the initial and secondary public offerings of onsale common stock  million from issuance of series b preferred stock pursuant to exercise of warrants  and million received from stock issuances under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  partially offset by cash used to pay million of notes payable relating to the surplus direct acquisition 
operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million in  million in and million in the net cash used in operating activities in was primarily attributable to our net loss from operations of million 
the net loss was partially offset by depreciation and amortization expense of million  the million write off and abandonment of duplicate assets related to the acquisition of old egghead  including goodwill related to these assets  an increase in accounts payable of million and an increase in accrued expenses of million 
additionally  the uses were partially offset by elimination of the duplication of old egghead s fiscal fourth quarter loss of million 
net cash used in operating activities in was primarily attributable to our net loss from operations of million  a decrease in restructuring liabilities of million  an increase in merchandise inventory of million and a gain on sale of equity investment of million 
these uses were partially offset by depreciation and amortization expense of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in accrued expenses of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
net cash used in operating activities in was primarily due to the operating loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million  and decreases in liabilities for discontinued operations and restructuring liabilities of and million  respectively 
these uses were partially offset by restructuring charges of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million and decreases in accounts receivable and merchandise inventory of and million  respectively 
the restructuring charges and changes in accounts payable  inventory and accounts receivable relate primarily to the closing of old egghead s retail stores 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million during  million during and million during net cash used in investing activities in primarily reflects the purchase of approximately million of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities during primarily reflects our net investment of excess cash in short term marketable securities  million at december   and an investment of million in property and equipment including fixtures and equipment for our new corporate headquarters and california warehouse  continued investment in hardware required for our web sites and related software and hardware  partially offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of the former old egghead headquarters building and net proceeds of million from the sale of our equity interest in elekom corporation 
net cash used in investing activities during primarily consisted of asset purchases of million 
cash  cash equivalents and commitments cash and cash equivalents 
as of december  we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term available for sale investments 
we have credit lines totaling million available for the financing of inventory 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit 
commitments 
as of december  our principal commitments consisted of an obligation of approximately million under operating leases for our corporate offices and warehouse and obligations of approximately million under additional operating leases 
these amounts do not include obligations related to retail store leases which have been fully provided for 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  but we anticipate purchasing approximately million of property and equipment during  primarily for computer and office equipment 
we have certain sponsorship agreements which allow us to appear as the sponsor on specific web sites 
these agreements require future payments of up to approximately million and incremental fees under certain circumstances based on the volume of traffic to our web site 
these agreements expire at various times through december in addition  we have commitments for other advertising and promotional arrangements of approximately million 
we had million of restricted cash  which primarily represented collateral for the lease of our vancouver  washington office 
during  we funded our initial investment of million in our joint venture with softbank corporation through an unsecured note payable to softbank corporation 
the principal and accrued interest thereon is due upon the earlier of the closing date of an initial public offering of the joint venture or december  with interest accruing at a fluctuating rate equal to the short term prime rate of the dai ichi kangyo bank in tokyo  japan as of december  
this note has no right of offset against our investment in the joint venture 
old egghead offered credit to some of its business customers and we began offering credit to business customers on our site in the fourth quarter of and may require additional cash to support the anticipated growth in accounts receivable 
we expect our operating expenses to remain high as we continue our marketing efforts  software development efforts  and continue to support the infrastructure required to grow our business 
as a result  we expect to experience quarterly net losses through at least the year  and thus we will need to finance our increased inventory  accounts receivable  capital expenditures and some portion of our operating expenses from our current cash and cash equivalents balance 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balance will meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital expenditures for at least the next months 
in february  we entered into an equity financing agreement under which we may sell shares of our common stock over a nine month period beginning february  this agreement provides that the minimum price at which we will sell the common stock is per share before discount  unless a lower minimum is mutually agreed to by both parties 
on march   we sold approximately  shares of common stock at an average price of per share  reflecting a discount on market prices  which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
on march   we amended this agreement to provide for the sale of an additional million shares of common stock for per share  reflecting a discount of to the closing market price of our common stock on that date  which will result in net proceeds to us of an additional million 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution in our stockholders ownership interest 
we cannot assure you that financing described above or additional financing will be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the new standard requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
because we do not use derivatives  the new standard is expected to have no material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies 
our revenue recognition policies comply with the requirements of sab risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should consider the risks described below and the other information in this report carefully 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks that we are aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may become important factors that affect our business 
if any of the following risks occur  or if others occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
based on restated historical financial statements  we incurred net losses since as of december   we had a combined net accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to experience substantial quarterly net losses for the foreseeable future  due primarily to the following factors competitive pricing pressures  which we expect to continue to negatively affect gross margins  we expect to spend significant amounts on operating expenses  in particular marketing expenses  and we expect spend a substantial amount on our infrastructure 
we may seek additional financing and may not be able to secure it 
we expect to raise additional funds within the next months 
for instance  in early march  we issued approximately  shares of common stock under our common stock purchase agreement with acqua wellington north american equities fund  ltd  resulting in net proceeds of approximately  million  and are currently in the process of issuing million shares which will result in net proceeds of approximately million 
shares issued under this agreement  through the end of march will approximate of the outstanding shares at that time 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or may not be available to us at all 
shares sold under the acqua wellington agreement  or if we otherwise raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  may result in significant dilution of your ownership interest 
additionally  we could issue securities that have rights senior to the rights of common stockholders 
due to competitive pressures and our efforts to expand and maintain market share  our profit margins may remain low for the foreseeable future 
some of our competitors sell products that are commonly available from major distributors at or near their purchase price 
this may cause us to reduce our selling prices on the same or similar goods  which would reduce profit margins 
we plan to make aggressive efforts to expand and maintain our market share  and our profit margins may continue to be negatively affected as a result 
we may attempt to expand our market share for auctioned goods by increasing the quantity of products available for bid at any one time  which tends to decrease revenues per unit 
we may also use promotional pricing and enhanced customer service to increase our market share for current version sales 
one of the effects of these strategies may be low margins  and we may not be successful in increasing or maintaining our market share in either or both lines of business 
even if we are successful in increasing our market share  continued competition and customer expectations may make it difficult to improve profit margins in the future 
accordingly  our profits and stock price may be harmed 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly and may be difficult to predict 
the operating results of onsale and old egghead prior to the merger fluctuated  and we expect our operating results to fluctuate in the future  due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include pricing competition  the availability and pricing of merchandise from vendors  our ability to manage our inventory mix and the mix of products offered for auction  and take other actions required to maintain customer satisfaction  the degree to which our sales of new  current version merchandise at attractive prices reduces sales of similar products on our auction site  seasonal fluctuations in buying patterns of new and reconditioned merchandise and in the availability of reconditioned merchandise  the level of traffic at our web site  and our ability to attract new customers and to retain existing customers  the announcement or introduction of new types of merchandise  service offerings or customer services by us or our competitors  the timing  cost and availability of web advertising  the amount and timing of costs relating to expansion of our operations  interruptions to or increases in the costs associated with the normal flow of our business operations  including the occurrence of technical or communications failures or stoppages by common carriers such as united parcel service  and governmental regulation and taxation policies 
due to these factors  factors discussed elsewhere in this document  or unforeseen factors  in some future quarter our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  in which event the trading price of our common stock may decline 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our business could be harmed 
we expect to continue to expand our operations  and in order to manage our growth  we face many challenges  including maintaining and improving existing operational  financial and inventory systems  procedures and controls  and implementing new systems  procedures and controls  integrating new key managerial and technical employees into our existing management team  training  motivating and managing our employee base  managing relationships with third parties  managing risks associated with accounts receivable expansion and collection  and we depend on key employees 
our future performance depends upon contributions from members of our senior management and other key personnel 
most of our key personnel do not have long term employment agreements  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance 
competition for attracting and retaining personnel in our industry is intense  especially in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters and one of our operating sites are located  and we may fail to attract and retain the personnel we will need to succeed in the future 
it is difficult for us to attract new employees by offering stock options due to the volatility of our stock price 
if one or more of our key personnel leaves us or joins a competitor  our business could be harmed 
the expected benefits of our merger with old egghead might not be realized 
the potential benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of our merger with old egghead may be more difficult to achieve than expected  or may not be achievable at all 
for example we may be unable to derive or maintain an amount of revenue per visitor to our web sites that is similar to the amount we derived from visitors to our web site before the merger  our efforts to build a single  widely recognized online brand may be more expensive than anticipated  or may be of limited utility in product areas outside of computer related products  anticipated cost reductions may not be achieved  or may be offset by unanticipated cost increases  we operate in an extremely competitive market and we could lose revenue and customers to our competitors 
existing competitors 
the electronic commerce market  particularly over the internet  is new  rapidly evolving and competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
we compete with many other companies which either offer the same types of merchandise or provide the same or a similar type of sales format to customers 
refer to the section titled business competition for a list of competitors 
new competitors 
it is not difficult to enter the online commerce market  and current and new competitors can launch new online commerce web sites at relatively low cost 
competition in online commerce will likely increase as retailers  suppliers  manufacturers and direct marketers who have not traditionally sold computer products and consumer goods directly to consumers through the internet enter this market segment 
increased competition may result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  increased marketing costs or loss of market share  or any combination of these problems 
new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire market share in several ways  including through mergers or by alliances among competitors and vendors 
for example  dell computer corporation and amazon 
com  inc have agreed to provide links from their web sites to new web pages that advertise their respective products 
through such alliances  competitors may also obtain exclusive or semi exclusive sources of merchandise 
in addition  manufacturers may elect to liquidate their products directly over the internet 
companies that primarily conduct online person to person auctions  such as ebay inc  may develop into direct competitors in the future 
we may not be successful in competing against competitors 
many of these competitors have greater financial  marketing  customer support  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to secure merchandise from suppliers on more favorable terms than us  and they may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer preference or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their merchandise than we can 
if competition increases and our branding efforts are not successful  we may not be able to command higher margins on the products we sell  or we may lose revenue and customers to our competitors 
if we cannot continue to build strong brand loyalty  our business will be harmed 
we believe that development and awareness of the egghead 
com brand is critical to our success in attracting customers 
furthermore  we believe that brand loyalty will become increasingly important as low barriers to entry encourage the proliferation of web sites 
if we are unsuccessful in continuing to build strong brand loyalty  our business will be harmed 
in order to attract and retain consumers and advertisers  and to promote and maintain the egghead 
com brand in response to competitive pressures  we intend to increase our online and offline marketing and advertising 
we believe that advertising rates generally  and the cost of online advertising campaigns in particular  could increase substantially in the future 
despite our efforts  consumers or advertisers may not perceive our web site or the egghead 
com brand as superior to the web sites or brands of our competitors 
we have a limited operating history as an online commerce company  which makes our business difficult to evaluate 
we have a limited operating history as an online commerce company 
we were incorporated in and did not generate any revenues until july old egghead was incorporated in but changed its business model from a chain of retail stores to an online commerce web site beginning in february our prospects will therefore be subject to the risks  expenses and uncertainties frequently encountered by young companies that operate in the new and rapidly evolving markets for internet products and services 
these risks include evolving and unpredictable business models  intense competition  our need and ability to manage growth  and the rapid evolution of technology in electronic commerce 
our business may face increased government regulation 
auctioneering and other laws 
several states have laws that regulate auctions and auction companies within their jurisdiction 
some states may interpret their statutes to apply to our transactions with consumers in such states 
the burdens of complying with auctioneering laws could materially increase our cost of doing business 
similarly  states may construe their existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  sales tax  libel and personal privacy to apply to internet companies servicing consumers within their boundaries 
resolution of whether or how these laws will be applied is uncertain and may take years to resolve 
consumer protection laws 
we could be subject to regulation under consumer protection laws in various states 
several states  including california and washington  have laws regulating the disclosure of pricing information by wholesalers and comparable businesses 
in the future  governments of california  washington and other states could require additional disclosure in order to comply with other regulations 
tax laws 
the tax treatment of the internet and electronic commerce is currently unsettled 
a number of proposals have been made at the federal  state and local level and by certain foreign governments that could impose taxes on the sale of goods and services and certain other internet activities 
our business may be harmed by the passage of laws in the future imposing taxes or other burdensome regulations on online commerce 
new internet laws 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet generally  covering issues such as user privacy  pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services 
similarly  the growth and development of the market for internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business over the internet 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of commerce over the internet  increase our cost of doing business or otherwise harm our business 
we may have to qualify to do business in other jurisdictions 
because our service is available over the internet in multiple states and foreign countries  and we sell to consumers resident in such states and foreign countries  such jurisdictions may claim that we are required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each of these states and foreign countries 
if we fail to qualify as a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where we are required to do so  we could be subject to taxes and penalties 
we face risks associated with purchasing and carrying our own inventory 
we purchase inventory from vendors 
risks of carrying inventory include potential declines in the market value of the goods that we purchase  difficulties managing customer returns and credits associated with merchandise to be returned to vendors  shrinkage resulting from theft  loss or inaccurate inventory recording  and unpredictable sale prices due to the nature of our auction process 
if we manage our inventory poorly  we may be forced to sell our inventory at a discount or loss 
we rely on merchandise vendors for supply  shipping and quality of products 
supply 
we rely on vendors to supply us with merchandise 
for the year ended december   purchases from tech data  a distributor of computers and related products  accounted for approximately of our aggregate merchandise purchases 
we have no long term contracts or arrangements with our vendors that guarantee the availability of merchandise 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient quality and quantities of merchandise at competitive prices 
also  the quality of service provided by such parties may fall below the standard needed to enable us to conduct our business effectively 
we cannot assure you that our current vendors will continue to supply merchandise or that we will be able to establish new vendor relationships that will ensure that merchandise will be available 
customer service shipping and quality of products returns 
we rely on some of our vendors to ship merchandise directly to customers 
consequently  we have limited control over the goods shipped by these vendors  and shipments of goods may be subject to delays and shipment errors 
in addition  we may accept returns from customers for which we will not receive reimbursements from manufacturers or vendors 
if the quality of service provided by such vendors falls below a satisfactory standard or if our level of returns exceeds expectations  this could harm our business 
we rely on other third parties in conducting our operations 
in conducting our operations  we depend on several other third parties  including the following fulfillment 
third parties fulfill a significant portion of our sales 
any service interruptions experienced by these distribution centers as a result of labor problems or otherwise could disrupt or prevent fulfillment of customer orders  operating software 
our internally developed auction software depends on operating systems  database and server software that have been developed  produced by and licensed from third parties  payment processing 
we rely on one or two processors of credit card transactions 
if computer systems failures or other problems were to prevent them from processing our credit card transactions  we would experience delays and business disruptions  and shipping 
we use one or two primary delivery services to ship our products 
our business would suffer if labor problems or other causes prevented these or any other major carriers from delivering our products for significant time periods 
we may not be able to maintain satisfactory relationships with any of the above parties on acceptable commercial terms  and the quality of services that they provide may not remain at the levels needed to enable us to conduct our business effectively 
our online commerce systems are vulnerable to interruption 
customer access to our web site will directly affect the volume of orders and thus affect our revenues 
system interruptions may make our web site unavailable or prevent us from fulfilling orders efficiently  reducing the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services 
we may need to add hardware and software and further develop and upgrade our existing technology  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic on our web site and increased sales volume 
we maintain substantially all of our computer and communications hardware at two facilities  in menlo park  california and vancouver  washington 
our systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  network break ins  earthquake and similar events 
our backup systems and disaster recovery plan may not be adequate  and we may not have sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses from a major interruption 
computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins  deliberate attempts by third parties to exceed the capacity of our systems and similar disruptions could cause system interruptions  delays and loss of critical data  and could prevent us from providing services and accepting and fulfilling customer orders 
we depend on continued improvements in the internet infrastructure and in our own systems 
growth of the internet generally 
our success depends in large part on the development of the internet infrastructure and related enabling technologies  performance improvements and security measures for providing reliable internet access and services 
the internet could suffer from performance problems or outages due to continued growth in internet users and their bandwidth requirements  which could lead to decreased usage or growth in usage of our web site 
also  our ability to increase the speed with which we provide services to consumers and to increase the scope of such services is limited by and dependent upon the speed and reliability of the internet 
consequently  the emergence and growth of the market for our services is dependent on future improvements to the entire internet 
growth of our own systems in particular 
our revenues depend upon the number of visitors who use our web site and the volume of orders we fulfill through our web sites 
we use an internally developed system for our web site and several aspects of transaction processing  including billing  shipping and tracking 
we may be required to add additional hardware and software and further develop and upgrade our existing technology  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic on our web site and increased sales volume through our transaction processing systems 
any failure to do so may cause unanticipated systems disruptions  slower response times  degradation in levels of customer service  impaired quality and speed of order fulfillment or delays in reporting accurate financial information 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property 
generally  our performance and ability to compete are dependent to an important degree on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  which include the following our proprietary technology  our registered us trademarks and our other trademarks and service marks  and our domain names  each of which relates to our brand 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  regulations governing domain names  confidentiality agreements and technical measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights  and our inability or failure to do so could result in lost or forgone licensing revenues  dilution of the egghead 
com brand and other loss of competitive and commercial advantages that we hold 
additionally  we may choose to litigate to protect our intellectual property rights  which could result in a significant cost of resources and money to us 
we may not be successful in any litigation that we undertake 
we could face litigation risks 
intellectual property rights 
our business activities may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  and we have in the past received  and may in the future receive  notices from third parties claiming infringement by our software or other aspects of our business 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of resources and management attention  and could require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
successful litigation could result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or significant liability for damages  which could harm our business 
products liability and consumer protection 
our sale of products through our web sites could subject us to product liability claims or consumer protection regulation  and states and other jurisdictions other than california and washington may interpret their products liability or consumer protection laws to apply to internet commerce providers such as us that enter into transactions with their residents 
while we carry liability insurance  this may not be adequate to compensate for substantial claims  and these claims could have a harmful effect on our business 
liability for information transmitted over our online services 
the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through our services is currently unsettled 
claims could be made against us under both united states and foreign law for defamation  libel  invasion of privacy  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through our services 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose such liability on other online services companies are currently pending 
in addition  legislation has been proposed that imposes liability for or prohibits the transmission over the internet of certain types of information 
the potential imposition of liability on online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services could require us to alter our service offerings 
we expect our stock price to be volatile 
the market price of the shares of our common stock has been and we expect it to continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors  such as actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  announcements of technological innovations  new sales formats  services or product introductions by us or our competitors  developments with respect to patents  copyrights or proprietary rights  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and conditions and trends in the internet and electronic commerce industries 
the stock markets generally  and the nasdaq national market in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these market fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions  interest rates or international currency fluctuations  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation against several companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in diversion of our management s attention and resources and substantial financial costs
