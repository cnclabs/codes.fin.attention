item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
overview we were founded in and our common stock became publicly traded in december we have been profitable in each of our last ten fiscal quarters 
revenues our revenues consist of three components net sales  research and development revenue and royalty income 
net sales 
net sales is comprised of absorbable biomaterials products and angio seal devices manufactured by us 
biomaterials 
the biomaterials component of net sales represents the sale of our biomaterials products to customers for use in the following markets orthopedics  cardiology  drug biologics delivery and wound care 
historically  our biomaterials sales have represented primarily the absorbable collagen and polymer components of the angio seal device supplied to st 
jude medical 
we have experienced significant sales growth in our biomaterials products in fiscal years  and due to sales to new customers  increased sales to existing customers  new product offerings and the expansion of our marketing activities 
we believe this growth will continue because of greater acceptance by the medical community of biomaterials and technological advances which have expanded the applications for our biomaterials products 
angio seal devices 
historically  we supplied our strategic partner with partially completed f angio seal devices 
in fiscal years and  we supplied our partner with f angio seal devices to supplement their production requirements 
subsequent to year end  st 
jude medical transitioned the manufacturing of these devices to their facility 
we do not expect any revenue from the manufacture of completed angio seal devices in the future 
research and development revenue 
historically  research and development revenue has been derived solely from development work performed on the angio seal 
as anticipated  the research and development activities have transitioned to st 
jude medical and no significant research and development revenue is expected in the future 
royalty income 
we receive a royalty on every angio seal unit sold worldwide 
we anticipate sales of the angio seal device will continue to grow  particularly due to the recent launches of the f angio seal in the us and europe 
as a result  royalty income will continue to be a significant source of revenue 
the anticipated increase in unit sales will be partially offset in the fiscal year by an anticipated reduction in our royalty rate  from to  in accordance with our licensing agreements 
we expect this rate reduction will occur during the second quarter of fiscal year cost of products sold we have experienced an overall increase in gross margin during the fiscal year as our net sales have increased and we have been able to spread our fixed costs of manufacturing over a greater number of units 
we anticipate our gross margin will continue to improve as our sales levels increase and our product mix becomes more favorable  reflecting the shift to higher margin sales of biomaterials products and a reduction in sales of lower margin angio seal devices 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred for the development of our proprietary technology such as the aegis vortex  absorbable biomaterials products and technologies and other development programs 
while research and development on the angio seal has become an insignificant portion of our overall development costs  the progression of the aegis vortex into the clinical trial phase and our continued development of proprietary biomaterials products and technologies will offset this decrease 
we anticipate research and development expense will continue to increase as we pursue commercialization of the aegis vortex as well as explore opportunities for our other technologies 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses include general and administrative costs as well as costs related to the marketing of our products 
during the fiscal years and  the costs of our patent litigation are also included within selling  general and administrative expenses 
we anticipate the marketing component of selling  general and administrative expenses  which has been insignificant in past fiscal years  will increase as we evaluate opportunities for commercialization of the aegis vortex and expand the marketing efforts for our biomaterials business 
results of operations comparison of fiscal and revenues 
revenues increased to million in the year ended june   or fiscal  from million in the year ended june   or fiscal net sales of products increased to million from million for fiscal and  respectively 
of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in sales of f angio seal devices to st 
jude medical 
the remaining million was attributable to increased sales of biomaterials products 
we had been providing st 
jude medical with f angio seal devices for the international and us markets  however  st 
jude medical has now transitioned the manufacturing of these devices to their facility 
research and development revenues 
research and development revenues decreased to  from million for fiscal and  respectively 
st 
jude medical has transitioned substantially all of the angio seal research and development in house 
we do not expect research and development revenues to be significant in the future 
royalty income 
royalty income increased  net of a million supplemental payment from our previous strategic partner in fiscal  to million from million in fiscal and  respectively 
royalty units increased as approximately  angio seal units were sold to end users during fiscal compared to approximately  units sold during fiscal this unit increase was due to st 
jude medical s increased sales and marketing efforts  primarily in the us  and sales of the new f device in the international markets 
the f device was introduced in the international markets in april and in the us in late march cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal however  gross margin increased to from 
this increase reflected an allocation of overhead across a greater sales volume  which resulted in a decrease in per unit costs 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease was mainly attributable to the transition of substantially all of the development for the angio seal product line to st 
jude medical 
this decrease was offset by our continued development efforts on the aegis vortex  including clinical trial expenses 
we also continued to expand our development efforts on our biomaterials products 
we expect research and development expense to increase as we investigate and develop new products  conduct clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for our proprietary products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  or  in fiscal from fiscal this increase was primarily the result of increased sales and marketing efforts for the aegis vortex and our biomaterials products offset by a decrease in litigation expenses 
net interest income 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this was due to the addition of a million financing agreement in january  of which  was used to repay a portion of the million term loan 
the remainder of the proceeds from the million financing agreement was used to fund leasehold improvements and capital expansion 
the financing agreement was repaid on june  with proceeds from our secondary offering 
interest income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of an increase in average total cash and investment balances 
other non operating income expense 
other non operating expense was  for fiscal compared to other non operating income of  for fiscal other non operating income expense for both periods represented primarily the net gain or loss on the sale of fixed assets 
comparison of fiscal and revenues 
revenues increased to million in fiscal  from million in the year ended june   or fiscal net sales of products increased to million from million 
of this  million was attributable to increased sales of biomaterials products comprised of million of biomaterials products sold to multiple customers and  of increased sales of angio seal components to st 
jude medical 
the remaining increase was attributable to the sale of f angio seal devices to st 
jude medical for the international market 
research and development revenue 
research and development revenue decreased to million from million 
the decrease was due to a reduction in angio seal research and development activity as the f angio seal transitioned from development to commercialization 
royalty income 
royalty income increased to million from million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
of this increase  million was due to increased unit sales of angio seal 
approximately  angio seal units were sold to end users in fiscal compared to approximately  units sold in fiscal the increase in angio seal unit volume reflected the launch of the f angio seal in europe in fiscal as well as increased demand for the f angio seal in both the us and european markets in fiscal versus fiscal in addition  we received a million supplemental royalty payment in fiscal cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal however  the gross margin increased to from 
the increase in gross margin reflects an allocation of overhead across greater sales volume  which results in a decrease in per unit costs  as well as increased sales of higher margin biomaterials products 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was mainly attributable to increased development efforts on the aegis vortex as we applied for and received our investigational device exemption  or ide  from the fda and prepared for the initiation of clinical trials of the device 
we also expanded our development efforts in the area of absorbable biomaterials 
these increases in expense were offset by the ongoing transition of development of the angio seal product line to st 
jude medical along with the f product moving to commercialization 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily a result of legal expenses in the amount of  related to our ongoing patent infringement suit 
we incurred no legal expenses related to this lawsuit in fiscal net interest income 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was due to the addition of a million financing agreement in fiscal  of which  was used to repay a portion of the existing million term loan 
the remainder of the proceeds from the million financing agreement will be used to fund leasehold improvements and for capital expansion 
interest income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of an increase in average total cash and investment balances 
other non operating income 
other non operating income remained constant at  for fiscal and fiscal fiscal other non operating income represented primarily a net gain on the sale of fixed assets while fiscal represented miscellaneous nonrecurring items 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by our operating activities was million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  changes in asset and liability balances resulted in a net million use of cash  offset by net income of million and non cash depreciation and amortization of  in fiscal  changes in asset and liability balances resulted in a net million use of cash  offset by net income of million and non cash depreciation and amortization of million 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at june  in addition  we had million in restricted investment accounts 
we have pledged million in investments as collateral to secure bank loans made to employees to pay taxes incurred by these employees when they received common stock at the time of our initial public offering 
in exchange for our pledging this collateral  the employees have pledged their common stock to us as collateral 
in may  we completed a secondary offering of  shares of common stock 
in addition  the underwriters exercised a portion of their over allotment option in june for an additional  shares of common stock 
the net proceeds of the secondary offering were million 
of the proceeds  million was used to repay outstanding indebtedness 
we had a capital spending plan for fiscal  of which million was expended primarily on machinery  equipment and leasehold improvements 
these expenditures were related to the continued expansion of our manufacturing capabilities  principally for our biomaterials product lines 
we received a million royalty advance under our licensing agreement upon receipt of fda approval for the angio seal in fiscal year this royalty advance has been reduced in each period by of the excess of royalty income over minimum royalties stipulated within the licensing agreement 
during fiscal  the liability was retired 
in november  we acquired patents in exchange for  shares of common stock and a series of eight quarterly cash payments  which began on march   totaling million 
the patents were recorded on the balance sheet at the value of the shares on the date of the agreement plus the present value of the million cash and the legal and other related costs incurred to acquire such patents 
the present value of the cash payments  million  was recorded on the balance sheet as an obligation and was fully repaid during fiscal we plan to continue to spend substantial amounts to fund clinical trials  to gain regulatory approvals and to continue to expand research and development activities  particularly for the aegis vortex and our biomaterials products 
we believe cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for the next twelve months 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments as well as interest paid on our debt 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of high quality us government securities and certificates of deposit with an average maturity of one year or less 
we mitigate default risk by investing in what we believe are the safest and highest credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and there are limitations regarding duration of investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and decrease in market value if interest rates increase 
at june   our total portfolio consisted of approximately million of investments  all of which had maturities within one year 
additionally  we generally hold securities until maturity 
therefore  we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
we have no outstanding debt at june  risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors  in addition to the other information set forth in this report  before purchasing shares of common stock of kensey nash 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition  as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
this investment involves a high degree of risk 
risks related to our business if our biomaterials products are not successful  our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
the success of our existing biomaterials products  as well as any we develop in the future  depends on a variety of factors  including our ability to continue to manufacture  sell and competitively price these products and the acceptance of these products by the medical profession 
in addition  we may be required to obtain regulatory approval for any future biomaterials products 
we will require substantial additional funds to develop and market our biomaterials products 
we expect to fund the growth of our biomaterials business out of our operating income and cannot guarantee that this operating income will be sufficient to develop new biomaterials products 
to date  we have relied on strategic partners or customers to market and sell our biomaterials products 
we cannot assure you that we will commercialize our products successfully either indirectly through strategic partners or directly through the development of a sales force 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the aegis vortex 
we need to conduct additional human clinical trials for the aegis vortex 
the aegis vortex has not been approved for marketing by the fda or by any governmental entity outside of the united states 
we will require substantial additional funds to develop the product  conduct clinical trials and gain the necessary regulatory approvals for the aegis vortex 
prior to granting approval  the fda may require clarification of information provided in our regulatory submissions  more information or more clinical studies 
if granted  fda approval may impose limitations on the uses for which our product may be marketed or how our product may be marketed 
should we experience delays or be unable to receive approval from the fda  our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
a substantial portion of our revenues will continue to come from the angio seal which is manufactured  marketed and distributed by st 
jude medical 
to date  a significant portion of our revenues have been derived from angio seal sales 
under our license agreements with st 
jude medical  angio seal is manufactured  marketed and sold on a worldwide basis by st 
jude medical 
two of our significant sources of revenue for the future are expected to be sales of collagen to st 
jude medical for use in the angio seal devices and royalty income from the sale of the angio seal product line 
beginning june   st 
jude medical will no longer be obligated to buy collagen from us 
furthermore  we expect a reduction in our royalty rate  from to  during the second quarter of fiscal year in accordance with our license agreements 
our success with angio seal depends in part on the time  effort and attention that st 
jude medical devotes to the angio seal product line and on their success in manufacturing  marketing and selling the angio seal product line 
under the terms of our agreements with st 
jude medical  we have no control over the pricing and marketing strategy for the angio seal product line 
in addition  we depend on st 
jude medical to successfully maintain levels of manufacturing sufficient to meet anticipated demand  abide by applicable manufacturing regulations and seek reimbursement approvals 
st 
jude medical can terminate our arrangement at any time after september  for any reason upon months notice 
there can be no assurance that st 
jude medical will successfully pass future inspections of its manufacturing facility or adequately perform its manufacturing  marketing and selling duties 
any such failure by st 
jude medical may negatively impact angio seal sales and therefore reduce our royalties and impair our operating results and business 
we depend on our customers to market and obtain regulatory approvals for their biomaterials products 
we depend on the efforts of our biomaterials customers in marketing their products which include our biomaterials components 
there can be no assurance that our customers end use products which include our biomaterials components will be commercialized successfully by our customers or that our customers will otherwise be able to compete effectively in their markets 
if our customers fail to commercialize their products  our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
if we receive fda approval  we may not be successful commercializing the aegis vortex 
if the aegis vortex clinical trials are completed successfully and we obtain the necessary governmental approvals  we will need to commercialize the product 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to find a suitable partner and or develop and train our own sales force to sell and market the aegis vortex 
we do not have a sales and marketing force nor do we have any experience hiring or training a sales and marketing force 
we may not be able to establish and maintain an internal sales and marketing force with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities 
if we are unable to successfully commercialize the aegis vortex  our growth prospects will be diminished 
we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some or all of our efforts to develop and market the aegis vortex if we fail to obtain additional funding that may be required to satisfy our future capital needs 
we plan to continue to spend substantial funds to develop and market the aegis vortex 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress and success of our clinical trials  the timing and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the timing and cost of developing sales and marketing strategies  our ability to enter into strategic alliances  manufacturing and research and development activities  the extent to which the aegis vortex gains market acceptance and competitive developments 
any additional required financing may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development activities or sales and marketing efforts  in which case our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and are likely to become more competitive  and our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
the existing markets for our current and proposed products are intensely competitive 
we expect competition to increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets and or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours 
we compete with some of the largest players in the biomaterials markets 
if we are successful in commercializing the aegis vortex  our competitors will include boston scientific corporation  johnson and johnson  inc  possis medical  inc  percu surge inc 
and interventional technologies  inc  as well as other companies and other current and future therapies 
the primary competitors in the vascular sealing device market are abbott laboratories which owns perclose  inc  datascope corp 
and vascular solutions  inc our competitors may have broad product lines which allow them to negotiate exclusive  long term supply contracts and offer comprehensive pricing for their products 
broader product lines may also provide our competitors with a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralized purchasing 
greater financial resources and product development capabilities may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete 
because a significant portion of our revenue depends on sales of medical devices by our customers to the end user market  we are also affected by competition within the markets for these devices 
competition within the medical device market could also have an adverse effect on our business for a variety of reasons  including that our customers may compete directly with larger  dominant manufacturers with extensive product lines and greater sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
we are also unable to control other factors that may impact the commercialization of our components for end use products  such as marketing and sales efforts and competitive pricing pressures within particular markets 
if our products are not accepted by the medical community  our business may suffer 
the success of our existing products depends on continued acceptance of these products by the medical community 
the success of any products we develop in the future will depend on the adoption of these products by our targeted markets 
we cannot predict how quickly  if at all  the medical community will accept our future products or the extent to which our future products will be used 
if we encounter difficulties introducing future products into our targeted markets  our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
the loss of  or interruption of supply from  key vendors could limit our ability to manufacture our products 
we purchase certain materials and components for our products from various suppliers 
some of these components are custom made for us 
any loss of  or interruption of supply from  key vendors may require us to find new vendors 
we could experience production or development delays while we seek new vendors which could substantially impair our operating results and business 
we may have problems manufacturing and delivering our biomaterials products in the future 
the biomaterials industry is an emerging area  using many materials which are untested or whose properties are still not known 
consequently  from time to time we may experience unanticipated difficulties in manufacturing and delivering our biomaterials products to our customers 
these difficulties may include an inability to meet customer demand  delays in delivering products or quality control problems with certain biomaterials products 
any such difficulty to fulfill orders on a timely basis could materially and adversely affect our operating results and business 
our use of hazardous materials exposes us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 
because we use hazardous substances in our research and development and manufacturing operations  we are potentially subject to material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases or exposures at or from our facility 
decontamination costs  other clean up costs and related damages or liabilities could substantially impair our business and operating results 
we are required to comply with increasingly stringent laws and regulations governing environmental protection and workplace safety  including requirements governing the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances 
st 
jude medical s international sales are subject to a number of risks that could harm future international sales of angio seal and their ability to successfully commercialize new products in international markets 
st 
jude medical sells the angio seal product line internationally and pays us a royalty on each unit sold 
our royalties are subject to several risks  including the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers  weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries  fluctuations in exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political and economic instability 
the occurrence of any of these events could seriously harm st 
jude medical s future international sales and our ability to receive royalties from sales of the angio seal in international markets 
our success depends on key personnel  the loss of whom could impair our operating results and business 
our success depends  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of joseph w 
kaufmann  douglas g 
evans and other members of senior management 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could harm our operating results and business 
in addition  we will not be successful unless we can attract and retain skilled personnel  particularly in the areas of research and product development 
our failure to expand our management systems and controls to support anticipated growth or integrate future acquisitions could seriously harm our operating results and business 
our operations continue to grow and we expect this expansion to continue as we execute our business strategy 
sustaining our growth has placed significant demands on management and our administrative  operational  information technology  manufacturing  financial and personnel resources 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  client support and financial control systems  and effectively expand  train and manage our employee base 
we cannot assure you that any future acquisitions  or our recent acquisition of thm biomedical  inc  can be successfully integrated into our operations or be operated profitably 
we may not be able to manage our growth successfully 
this inability to sustain or manage our growth could seriously harm our operating results and business 
the ownership interest of our stockholders may be diluted by any future acquisitions or strategic alliances 
our stockholders will depend upon the judgment of our management with respect to any future acquisitions we make or strategic alliances we enter into 
our management may decide to acquire other companies or finance strategic alliances by issuing equity securities 
as a result  you may experience dilution of your ownership interest 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to protect our patents and proprietary rights  our reputation and competitiveness in the marketplace may be materially damaged 
we regard our patents  biomaterials trade secrets and other intellectual property as important to our success 
we rely upon patent law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements and license agreements with st 
jude medical to protect our proprietary rights 
we have registered certain of our patents with applicable governmental authorities 
effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which our products are made available  and we have not sought protection for our intellectual property in every country where our products may be sold 
there can be no assurance that the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or otherwise violate our patents or similar proprietary rights 
we and st 
jude medical are plaintiffs in a patent infringement lawsuit against perclose  which was acquired by abbott laboratories  and we are co defendants against counterclaims filed by perclose in response to our complaint 
we have spent substantial resources on this litigation 
intellectual property litigation in recent years has proven to be very costly and complex  and the outcome of such litigation is difficult to predict 
we may be accused of infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and any related litigation could materially damage our operating results and business 
an adverse determination in any intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings brought against us could prohibit us from selling our products  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
the costs associated with these license arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products 
we do not own or control the use of the angio seal trademark 
the term angio seal is a trademark of st 
jude medical 
all goodwill generated by the marketing and sales of devices bearing the angio seal trademark belongs to st 
jude medical and not to us 
should the st 
jude medical license agreements terminate  we would not have the right to call any of our products angio seal unless we purchase or license the trademark from st 
jude medical 
without rights to the angio seal trademark  we would have to market our products under a different trademark 
moreover  upon the termination of the st 
jude medical license agreements  st 
jude medical would have the right to compete against us by selling collagen and puncture closure devices under the angio seal trademark 
thus  purchasers of puncture closure devices may be more likely to recognize and purchase products labeled angio seal regardless of whether those devices originate from us 
risks related to our industry we may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities 
the manufacture and sale of medical products entail significant risk of product liability claims 
the medical device industry in general has been subject to significant product liability litigation 
any product liability claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  reduced sales  significant liabilities and diversion of our management s time  attention and resources 
we cannot be sure that our product liability insurance coverage is adequate or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
we face uncertainty relating to third party reimbursement for our products 
we could be seriously harmed by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payors  particularly to the extent any changes affect reimbursement for catheterization procedures in which our products are used 
if physicians  hospitals and other users of our products fail to obtain sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payors for procedures in which our products are used or adverse changes occur in governmental and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for these procedures  our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new and improved products 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental agencies  including the fda and comparable international agencies 
we are required to obtain the approval of the fda and international agencies before we can market and sell new products  satisfy these agencies requirements for all of our labeling  sales and promotional materials in connection with our existing products  comply with all applicable manufacturing regulations  and undergo rigorous inspections by these agencies 
compliance with the regulations of these agencies may delay or prevent us from introducing any new or improved products  including the aegis vortex 
furthermore  we may be subject to sanctions  including temporary or permanent suspension of operations  product recalls and marketing restrictions if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business 
we are also required to demonstrate compliance with the fda s quality system regulations 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through pre approval and periodic post approval inspections 
these regulations relate to product testing  vendor qualification  design control and quality assurance  as well as the maintenance of records and documentation 
if we are unable to conform to these regulations  we will be required to locate alternative manufacturers that do conform 
identifying and qualifying alternative manufacturers may be a long  costly and difficult process and could seriously harm our business 
the fda and international regulatory agencies may also limit the indications for which our products are approved 
these regulatory agencies may restrict or withdraw approvals we have received if additional information becomes available to support this action
