net interest income net interest income  the company s principal source of earnings  is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets 
factors that determine the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  yields earned and rates paid  the level of non performing loans and the amount of non interest bearing liabilities supporting earning assets 
net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
the adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate  and for  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million  an increase of approximately million  or  from net interest income 
the increase in in net interest income was the result of stable interest income and declining interest expense 
interest income remained stable from to as a result of a lower yield earned on earning assets offset by growth in the loan portfolio and an improvement in fees on loans 
the decline in interest expense from to was the result of a lower cost of funds 
yield on earning assets and cost of funds was lower in as the result of lower average interest rates during the net interest margin was in  compared to in and in for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million  an increase of approximately million  or  from comparable figures in the increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the growth due to purchase acquisitions during and other growth in the loan portfolio

the company seeks to manage its credit risk by diversifying its loan portfolio  determining that borrowers have adequate sources of cash flow for loan repayment without liquidation of collateral  obtaining and monitoring collateral  providing an adequate allowance for loan losses and regularly reviewing loans through the internal loan review process 
the loan portfolio is diversified by borrower  purpose  industry and  in the case of credit card loans  which are unsecured  by geographic region 
the company seeks to use diversification within the loan portfolio to reduce credit risk  thereby minimizing the adverse impact on the portfolio  if weaknesses develop in either the economy or a particular segment of borrowers 
collateral requirements are based on credit assessments of borrowers and may be used to recover the debt in case of default 
the company uses the allowance for loan losses as a method to value the loan portfolio at its estimated collectible amount 
loans are regularly reviewed to facilitate the identification and monitoring of deteriorating credits 
consumer loans consist of credit card loans  student loans and other consumer loans 
consumer loans were million at december   or of total loans  compared to million  or of total loans at december  the consumer loan increase from to is the result of the company s higher credit card volume and increased indirect lending loans originated by third parties  which are underwritten and purchased by the company

this includes nonaccrual loans and certain loans identified by management 
non performing loans are comprised of a nonaccrual loans  b loans that are contractually past due days and c other loans for which terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal  because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
the subsidiary banks recognize income principally on the accrual basis of accounting 
when loans are classified as nonaccrual  the accrued interest is charged off and no further interest is accrued 
loans  excluding credit card loans  are placed on a nonaccrual basis either when there are serious doubts regarding the collectability of principal or interest  or when payment of interest or principal is days or more past due and either i not fully secured or ii not in the process of collection 
if a loan is determined by management to be uncollectable  the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectible is then charged to the allowance for loan losses 
credit card loans are classified as impaired when payment of interest or principal is days past due 
litigation accounts are placed on nonaccrual until such time as deemed uncollectible 
credit card loans are generally charged off when payment of interest or principal exceeds days past due  but are turned over to the credit card recovery department  to be pursued until such time as they are determined  on a case by case basis  to be uncollectable

the unallocated reserve generally serves to compensate for the uncertainty in estimating loan losses  including the possibility of improper risk ratings and specific reserve allocations 
the unallocated reserve is a result of potential risk factors that cannot be quantified at december   including the impact of increased indirect lending and consumer bankruptcies inherent in the present portfolio 
investments and securities the company s securities portfolio is the second largest component of earning assets and provides a significant source of revenue 
securities within the portfolio are classified as either held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
held to maturity securities  which include any security for which management has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity  are carried at historical cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
premiums and discounts are amortized and accreted  respectively  to interest income using the constant yield method over the period to maturity 
interest and dividends on investments in debt and equity securities are included in income when earned 
available for sale securities  which include any security for which management has no immediate plans to sell  but which may be sold in the future  are carried at fair value

management anticipates that these sources will provide necessary funding in the foreseeable future 
the company s general policy is to avoid the use of brokered deposits 
long term debt the company s long term debt was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the outstanding balance for december  includes million in long term debt and million of trust preferred securities 
this debt was incurred to fund a portion of the purchase price of the acquisitions completed in the company also has assumed fhlb long term advances during acquisitions 
the outstanding balance for fhlb long term advances was million as of december  capital at december   the total capital reached million  another milestone in the company s history 
capital represents shareholder ownership in the company the book value of assets in excess of liabilities 
at year end  the company s equity to asset ratio was compared to at year end the federal reserve board s risk based guidelines established a risk adjusted ratio  relating capital to different categories of assets and off balance sheet exposures  such as loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
these guidelines place a strong emphasis on tangible stockholders equity as the core element of the capital base  with appropriate recognition of other components of capital 
at december   the tier capital ratio was  while the company s total risk based capital ratio was  both of which exceed the capital minimums established in the risk based capital requirements

at december   undivided profits of the company s subsidiaries were approximately million  of which approximately million was available for the payment of dividends to the company without regulatory approval 
in addition to dividends  other sources of liquidity for the company are the sale of equity securities and the borrowing of funds 
banking subsidiaries generally speaking  the company s banking subsidiaries rely upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash used in investing activities 
typical of most banking companies  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities  such as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements  and the issuance of long term debt 
the banks primary investing activities include loan originations and purchases of investment securities  offset by loan payoffs and investment maturities 
liquidity represents an institution s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors and borrowers  by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds 
a major responsibility of management is to maximize net interest income within prudent liquidity constraints 
internal corporate guidelines have been established to constantly measure liquid assets  as well as relevant ratios concerning earning asset levels and purchased funds 
the management and board of directors of each bank subsidiary monitors these same indicators and makes adjustments as needed 
at year end  each subsidiary bank was within established guidelines and total corporate liquidity remains strong 
at december   cash and cash equivalents  trading and available for sale securities and mortgage loans held for sale were of total assets  as compared to at december  market risk management market risk arises from changes in interest rates 
the company has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk 
in asset and liability management activities  policies are in place that are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk represents the potential impact of interest rate changes on net income and capital resulting from mismatches in repricing opportunities of assets and liabilities over a period of time 
a number of tools are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including simulation models and interest sensitivity gap analysis 
management uses simulation models to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and various balance sheet strategies on the level of the company s net income and capital 
as a means of limiting interest rate risk to an acceptable level  management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities  change pricing schedules and manage investment maturities during future security purchases 
the simulation models incorporate management s assumptions regarding the level of interest rates or balance changes for indeterminate maturity deposits for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions have been developed through anticipated pricing behavior 
key assumptions in the simulation models include the relative timing of prepayments  cash flows and maturities 
in addition  the impact of planned growth and anticipated new business is factored into the simulation models 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the models cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of a change in interest rates on net income or capital 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
table presents the company s interest rate sensitivity position at december  this gap analysis is based on a point in time and may not be meaningful because assets and liabilities are categorized according to contractual maturities investment securities are according to call dates and repricing periods rather than estimating more realistic behaviors  as is done in the simulation models 
also  the gap analysis does not consider subsequent changes in interest rate level or spreads between asset and liability categories
