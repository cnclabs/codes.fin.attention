general we conduct our business within two business segments  which are as follows energy products segment our products include tubular steel products that are used in the energy industry 
these products include welded and seamless tubular goods  primarily used in oil and natural gas drilling and production operations 
these products are referred to as oil country tubular goods  or octg 
we also produce welded and seamless line pipe products which are used in the transmission of oil and natural gas 
we also produce a limited amount of other products  including standard pipe  piling and hot rolled coil 
industrial products segment our products include special bar quality products  or sbq 
these products are used for a wide variety of industrial applications  including farm equipment metal working fabrication heavy machinery construction off road vehicles automotive oil field tools and supplies discontinued operations on september   we announced that our board of directors approved a plan to sell the stock of our wholly owned subsidiary  imperial adhesives  inc as a result  the sales  costs and expenses  assets and liabilities  and cash flows of the industrial products adhesives segment have been classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements 
see note to the financial statements 
accordingly  the discussion and analysis that follow focus on the continuing operations of our remaining segments 
you should read note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information pertaining to industry segment data 
results of operations overview demand for our octg products is cyclical in nature  being dependent on the number and depth of oil and natural gas wells being drilled in the united states and globally 
the level of drilling activity is largely a function of the current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas 
in addition  shipments by domestic producers of octg products may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of inventory held by producers  distributors and end users  as well as by imports of octg products by foreign producers 
our business experience indicates that oil and natural gas prices are volatile and can have a substantial effect upon drilling levels and resulting demand for our energy related products 
demand for our octg products began to decline in the second half of fiscal and continued to decline significantly in fiscal significant declines in oil and natural gas prices led to a decline in drilling activity in the united states throughout most of fiscal this decline resulted in excessive industry wide tubular inventories  which further negatively affected our octg business 
the average number of oil and natural gas drilling rigs in operation in the united states  which is referred to as rig count  fell as low as in april  the lowest level in ns group s year history 
for all of fiscal  the average rig count was  also the lowest level in ns group s history 
by comparison  the average rig count was for fiscal the market conditions described above negatively affected our industry during the latter half of fiscal and throughout fiscal however  demand for our octg products rose steadily throughout fiscal as increasing oil and natural gas prices led to an increase in domestic drilling activity 
rig count averaged for fiscal and rose to for the fourth quarter of fiscal as such  our financial results improved throughout fiscal and the company returned to profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal see note for quarterly financial data 
our december  quarter shipments will decline significantly from the fourth quarter of fiscal levels as a result of an increase in imports and higher inventory levels of carbon grade octg products in the marketplace 
specifically affected will be our welded octg shipments 
we expect to incur operating losses in the energy products segment in the december  quarter 
since  the us government has been imposing duties on imports of various octg products from certain foreign countries in response to antidumping and countervailing duty cases filed by several us steel companies 
the us government is currently conducting sunset reviews of the duties to determine whether they should be revoked 
these reviews are expected to be completed by july in response to petitions filed with the us government by us and certain other line pipe producers  import relief was granted to the line pipe industry effective march  this relief is in the form of tariffs applied for three years to certain imports of line pipe from countries other than canada and mexico 
while the above mentioned actions have benefited domestic octg and line pipe producers  we cannot predict the us government s future actions regarding these duties and tariffs or any other future actions regarding import duties or other trade restrictions on imports of octg and line pipe products 
the marketplace for our sbq products has become increasingly competitive 
selling prices have declined significantly for the last two years  demand has declined and service center inventories remain high 
we expect to incur operating losses in the industrial products segment in the december  quarter 
ns group s net sales  gross profit loss  operating income loss and tons shipped by business segment for fiscal  and are summarized in the following table in thousands net sales energy products    industrial products    gross profit loss energy products    industrial products   operating income loss energy products    industrial products    corporate allocations    tons shipped energy products seamless    welded    industrial products    fiscal year compared to fiscal year total net sales in fiscal were million  an increase of from fiscal the increase in net sales was attributable primarily to our energy products segment

this compares to gross profit of million and operating income of million in fiscal fiscal results were also negatively impacted by lower operating efficiencies that resulted from significantly reduced operating levels  which was brought about by poor market demand for our energy products 
our combined melt shop capacity utilization was in fiscal compared to in fiscal our combined pipe mill capacity utilization was in fiscal compared to in fiscal in addition  our operating costs were negatively affected in fiscal by a six week shutdown at the melt shop of our welded tubular product facility for final installation of a new electric arc furnace and subsequent start up costs associated with the furnace 
selling  general and administrative expense for the energy products segment declined from fiscal due to reductions in employment costs and selling related expenses

recently issued accounting standards the sec recently issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
this bulletin will become effective for us in periods subsequent to september  we are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement  and we do not believe its application will have a material effect on our financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board has issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by statements no

these pronouncements  which become effective in fiscal  are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations because we do not presently use derivatives or engage in hedging activities 
the company will adopt eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs for periods subsequent to september  eitf requires that a seller of goods should classify in the income statement amounts billed to a customer for shipping and handling as revenue and should classify in the income statement costs incurred for shipping and handling as an expense 
one of our company s subsidiaries has reported shipping charges billed to customers as revenue  net of the actual costs incurred 
upon adoption  we will report the actual costs incurred to ship its products as a component of cost of sales and prior periods amounts will be reclassified to conform with the new presentations 
this change will have no effect on the company s gross profit margins 
the effects of eitf on the company s reported revenues and cost of sales were not material as of september other matters you should read note to the audited financial statements for information pertaining to commitments and contingencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our long term investments and long term debt  all of which are for other than trading purposes  are subject to interest rate risk 
information concerning the maturities and fair value of our interest rate sensitive investments and debt is included in notes  and to the audited financial statements 
we utilize professional investment advisors and consider our net interest rate risk when selecting the type and maturity of securities to purchase for our portfolio 
other factors considered include  but are not limited to  the timing of the expected need for the funds invested and the repricing and credit risks of the securities

as of september   we were not engaged in any activities which would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates or market commodity prices 
we purchase natural gas for our operations and therefore have a limited market risk in gas prices related to gas purchases in the open market at spot prices 
the prices of such gas purchases and futures positions are subject to wide fluctuations at times due to unpredictable factors such as weather  government policies and demand for natural gas and competitive fuels 
as a result  our earnings could be affected by changes in the price and availability of such gas 
as market conditions dictate  we from time to time will lock in future gas prices using fixed price contracts 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives
