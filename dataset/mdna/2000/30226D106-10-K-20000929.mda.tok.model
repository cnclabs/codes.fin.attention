item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
when used in this discussion and elsewhere in this form k  the words may  should  believes  expects  anticipates  estimates and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
such statements  which include statements concerning the availability and functionality of products under development  product mix  pricing trends  the mix of export sales  sales to significant customers and the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  are subject to risks and uncertainties  including those set forth below under factors that may affect our results 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof and there may be events in the future that we are not able to predict accurately or over which we have no control which would affect or alter our expectations 
overview from our inception in may through september  our operating activities related primarily to developing a research and development organization  testing prototype designs  building an asic design infrastructure  commencing the staffing of our marketing  sales and field service and technical support organizations  and establishing relationships with resellers and oems 
we commenced volume shipments of our summit and summit  the initial products in our summit stackable product family  in october  and we began shipping our blackdiamond modular product family in september we introduced our new alpine product family in fiscal which is based on a new generation chip set 
in addition  we also introduced new products within our existing product lines that incorporate this new chip set 
our revenue is derived primarily from sales of our summit and blackdiamond product families and fees for services relating to our products  including maintenance and training 
the level of sales to any customer may vary from period to period  however  we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future 
see factors that may affect our results if a key reseller  oem or other significant customer cancels or delays a large purchase  extreme s revenues may decline and the price of its stock may fall 
for fiscal  there were no customers with sales greater than 
for fiscal  compaq and hitachi cable accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
we market and sell our products primarily through resellers  distributors and  to a lesser extent  oems and our field sales organization 
we sell our products through more than resellers in countries 
in fiscal  sales to customers outside of north america accounted for approximately of our net revenue 
currently  all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
we generally recognize product revenue at the time of shipment  unless we have future obligations for installation or have to obtain customer acceptance  in which case revenue is deferred until such obligations have been satisfied 
we have established a program which  under specified conditions  enables third party resellers to return products to us 
the amount of potential product returns is estimated and provided for in the period of the sale 
service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract period  which is typically months 
we expect to experience rapid erosion of average selling prices of our products due to a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures  promotional pricing and rapid technological change 
our gross margins will be affected by such declines and by fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  component costs and the mix of product configurations sold 
in addition  our gross margins may fluctuate due to the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold  including the potential effects of our development of a two tier distribution channel 
we generally realize higher gross margins on sales to resellers and distributors than on sales through our oems 
any significant decline in sales to our oems or resellers or distributors  or the loss of any of our oems or resellers or distributors could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  new product introductions may result in excess or obsolete inventories 
any excess or obsolete inventories may also reduce our gross margins 
we outsource the majority of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations  and we conduct quality assurance  manufacturing engineering  documentation control and repairs at our facility in santa clara  california 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to our contract manufacturers  flextronics  mcms and solectron 
we expect to realize lower per unit product costs as a result of volume efficiencies 
however  we cannot assure you when or if such price reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such price reductions could materially adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
we expense all research and development expenses as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  as a result  we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and field service support functions  as well as trade shows and promotional expenses 
we intend to pursue sales and marketing campaigns aggressively and therefore expect these expenses to increase significantly in absolute dollars in the future 
in addition  we recently hired approximately sales and marketing personnel 
we expect to continue to expand our field sales operations to support and develop leads for our resellers and distributors  which will also result in an increase in sales and marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel  increase spending on our information systems and incur additional costs related to the anticipated growth of our business and operation as a public company 
during fiscal  in connection with the grant of certain stock options to employees  we recorded deferred stock compensation of  representing the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date such stock options were granted 
such amount is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized by charges to operations on a graded vesting method 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of approximately   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
at june   we had a total of approximately  remaining to be amortized over the corresponding vesting period of each respective option  generally four years 
the amortization expense relates to options awarded to employees in all operating expense categories 
despite growing revenues in all fiscal years since our inception  fiscal was the first year we have achieved profitability in each of the four quarters 
our net income has not increased proportionately with the increase in our revenue primarily because of increased expenses relating to our growth in operations and in particular the recent accelerated hiring of sales and marketing personnel 
because of the lengthy sales cycle of our products  there is often a significant delay between the time we incur expenses and the time we realize any related revenue 
see factors that may affect our results the sales cycle for extreme s products is long and extreme may incur substantial non recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated 
to the extent that future revenues do not increase significantly in the same periods in which operating expenses increase  our operating results would be adversely affected 
see factors that may affect our results a number of factors could cause extreme s quarterly financial results to be worse than expected  resulting in a decline in its stock price 
due to the company s issuance of warrants to a networking company as discussed in note  future operating income will be reduced by million per quarter for each quarter in fiscal and for three of the four fiscal quarters in fiscal notwithstanding this charge the company still anticipates being profitable in the first quarter of fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain financial data as a percentage of net revenue years ended june  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles total operating expenses operating income loss interest income interest expense

the increase in net revenue for fiscal resulted primarily from increased sales of our summit stackable products and the introduction of our blackdiamond modular product family in september export sales accounted for and of net revenue in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we expect that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenue  although we cannot assure you that export sales as a percentage of net revenue will remain at current levels 
all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
gross profit gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of million  primarily due to the related increase in revenue 
gross margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross margin resulted primarily from a shift in product mix  a shift in our channel mix from oems to resellers and distributors and improved manufacturing efficiencies  offset in part by lower average selling prices due primarily to increased competition 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of million 
gross margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross margin resulted primarily from reductions in component costs  improved manufacturing efficiencies and a shift in our channel mix from oems to resellers  which were offset in part by lower average selling prices due to increased competition 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of million

amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles was million in fiscal this amount was due to the company s issuance of fully earned  non forfeitable  fully exercisable warrants with a two year life to purchase million shares of the company s common stock with an exercise price of per share as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
future operating income will be reduced by approximately million per quarter for each quarter in fiscal and for three fiscal quarters in fiscal interest income interest income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of million 
the increase is due to the increased amount of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  restricted investments and long term investments from the proceeds we received from our initial public offering in april and our secondary public offering in october interest income increased from 
million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of million 
the increase is due to the increased amount of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments from the proceeds we received from our initial public offering in april income taxes we recorded a tax provision of million for the year ended june  the provision for fiscal results in an effective tax rate of which consists primarily of federal taxes  state income taxes and foreign taxes  offset by the recognition of deferred tax assets 
fasb statement no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
we intend to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we incurred significant operating losses for all fiscal years from inception through june  we recorded a tax provision of million for the year ended june   which consisted primarily of foreign taxes  federal taxes and state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased from million at june  to million at june   an increase of million 
the increase is primarily a result of our secondary public offering of common stock in october  which generated net proceeds of million  primarily offset by an increase in long term investments and restricted investments of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  as compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to net income  depreciation  amortization and increases in accounts payable  deferred revenue and accrued liabilities  offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories and other current and noncurrent assets 
we expect that accounts receivable will continue to increase to the extent our revenues continue to rise 
we expect our inventory levels to increase in connection with our development of a two tier distribution system  new product introductions and the need to maintain shorter lead times on certain products 
any such increase can be expected to reduce cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
investing activities used cash of million in fiscal due to capital expenditures of million  net purchases of investments of million and minority investments of million 
our investing activities used cash of million in fiscal for net purchases of investments of million and capital expenditures of million 
our investing activities used cash of million in fiscal for capital expenditures of million and net purchases of investments of million 
we expect capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal under the terms of a certain equity investment  upon the attainment of certain technological milestones  we will be obligated to purchase all of the outstanding capital stock in fiscal  payable in any combination of cash or shares of extreme common stock 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal  arising primarily from proceeds from the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our secondary public offering  partially offset by payments of capital lease obligations 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal  arising primarily from proceeds from the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our initial public offering  partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal  primarily from the issuance of convertible preferred stock and proceeds from notes payable  partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
in june  we entered into an operating lease agreement to lease  square feet to house our primary facility in santa clara  california 
our lease payments will vary based on the libor plus a spread which was at june  our lease payments are estimated to be approximately million on an annual basis over the lease term 
the lease is for five years and can be renewed for two five year periods  subject to the approval of the lessor 
at the expiration or termination of the lease  we have the option to either purchase the property for million  or arrange for the sale of the property to a third party for at least million with a contingent liability for any deficiency 
if the property is not purchased or sold as described above  we will be obligated for an additional lease payment of approximately million 
as part of the above lease transaction  the company restricted million of its investment securities as collateral for specified obligations of the lessee under the lease 
these investment securities are restricted as to withdrawal and are managed by a third party subject to certain limitations under the company s investment policy 
the lease also requires us to maintain specified financial covenants with which we were in compliance as of june  we require substantial capital to fund our business  particularly to finance inventories and accounts receivable and for capital expenditures 
as a result  we could be required to raise substantial additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
we cannot assure you that such additional capital  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain such additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  long term investments and cash available from credit facilities and future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no

fas amends the accounting and reporting standards of statement for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
the company will be required to adopt these pronouncements for the year ending june  because the company currently holds no derivative financial instruments and does not currently engage in hedging activities  adoption of fas and are expected to have no material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the implementation of sab has recently been deferred to no later than the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  the company is presently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of sab in march  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no

we do not anticipate that the adoption of interpretation no 
will have a material impact on our financial position or the results of our operations 
factors that may affect our results extreme has a limited history of profitability and cannot assure you that it will continue to achieve profitability although our revenue has grown in recent quarters  we cannot be certain that we will realize sufficient revenue to achieve continued profitability on a fiscal year basis 
fiscal was the first year in which extreme achieved profitability in each of the four quarters 
we anticipate continuing to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses and  as a result  we will need to generate significantly higher revenue to sustain profitability 
in particular  our recent hiring of approximately sales and marketing personnel has substantially increased expenses 
we expect that the hiring of such personnel will allow us to increase sales  however  we can not assure you that this will occur and we cannot assure you that operating margins will not be adversely affected by this or other hiring 
in addition  the amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill is estimated to be approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
a number of factors could cause extreme s quarterly financial results to be worse than expected  resulting in a decline in its stock price we plan to significantly increase our operating expenses to expand our sales and marketing activities  broaden our customer support capabilities  develop new distribution channels  fund increased levels of research and development and build our operational infrastructure 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
as a result  any delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause our quarterly operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
we may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenue because of a number of reasons 
orders at the beginning of each quarter typically do not equal expected revenue for that quarter and are generally cancelable at any time 
accordingly  we are dependent upon obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter to achieve our revenue objectives 
in addition  the timing of product releases  purchase orders and product availability could result in significant product shipments at the end of a quarter 
failure to ship these products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect our operating results 
furthermore  our customer agreements typically provide that the customer may delay scheduled delivery dates and cancel orders within specified time frames without significant penalty 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including 
fluctuations in demand for our products and services  including seasonality  particularly in asia and europe  
unexpected product returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders  
our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and manage product transitions  
announcements and new product introductions by our competitors  
our ability to develop and support customer relationships with service providers and other potential large customers  
our ability to achieve required cost reductions  
our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited sourced components for our products  
unfavorable changes in the prices of the components we purchase  
our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products  
the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold  and 
costs relating to possible acquisitions and integration of technologies or businesses 

the affect of amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles resulting from existing or new transactions 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
intense competition in the market for networking equipment could prevent extreme from increasing revenue and prevent extreme from sustaining profitability the market for internet switches is intensely competitive 
our principal competitors include cabletron systems  cisco systems  foundry networks  lucent technologies and nortel networks 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases  than we do 
these competitors may have developed  or could in the future  develop new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete 
to remain competitive  we believe we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products and enhancing our current products and maintaining customer satisfaction 
if we fail to do so  our products may not compete favorably with those of our competitors and our revenue and future profitability could be materially adversely affected 
extreme expects the average selling prices of its products to decrease rapidly which may reduce gross margins or revenue the network equipment industry has experienced rapid erosion of average selling prices due to a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures and rapid technological change 
we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors  including  for example  competitive products manufactured with low cost merchant silicon  or other factors 
therefore  to maintain our gross margins  we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so would cause our revenue and gross margins to decline  which could materially adversely affect our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
extreme s market is subject to rapid technological change and to compete  extreme must continually introduce new products that achieve broad market acceptance the network equipment market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
if we do not address these changes by regularly introducing new products  our product line will become obsolete 
developments in routers and routing software could also significantly reduce demand for our product 
alternative technologies could achieve widespread market acceptance and displace ethernet technology on which our product lines and architecture are based 
we cannot assure you that our technological approach will achieve broad market acceptance or that other technologies or devices will not supplant our approach 
when we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products  customers may defer purchasing our existing products 
these actions could materially adversely affect our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales  increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
the market for switching products is evolving and we believe our ability to compete successfully in this market is dependent upon the continued compatibility and interoperability of our products with products and architectures offered by other vendors 
in particular  the networking industry has been characterized by the successive introduction of new technologies or standards that have dramatically reduced the price and increased the performance of switching equipment 
to remain competitive we need to introduce products in a timely manner that incorporate or are compatible with these new technologies as they emerge 
for example  this fiscal year we introduced a new generation chipset which was incorporated in a new product family which began shipping in the quarter ended march  we cannot assure you that these new products will be commercially successful 
we have experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements in the past which delayed sales and resulted in lower quarterly revenue than anticipated 
we may experience similar delays in product development and release in the future and any delay in product introduction could adversely affect our ability to compete and cause our operating results to be below our expectations or the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
continued rapid growth will strain extreme s operations and will require extreme to incur costs to upgrade its infrastructure we have experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion which has placed  and continues to place  a significant strain on our resources 
even if we manage this growth effectively  we may make mistakes in operating our business such as inaccurate sales forecasting  incorrect material planning or inaccurate financial reporting  which may result in unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results 
our net revenue increased significantly during the last fiscal year  and from june  to june   the number of our employees increased from to we expect our anticipated growth and expansion to strain our management  operational and financial resources 
our management team has had limited experience managing such rapidly growing companies on a public or private basis 
to accommodate this anticipated growth  we will be required to 
improve existing and implement new operational  information and financial systems  procedures and controls  
hire  train and manage additional qualified personnel  including sales  marketing personnel and research and development personnel  and 
effectively manage multiple relationships with our customers  suppliers and other third parties 
we may not be able to install adequate control systems in an efficient and timely manner  and our current or planned personnel systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
in august  we installed a new management information system  which we may continue to modify and improve to meet the increasing needs associated with our growth 
the difficulties associated with installing and implementing these new systems  procedures and controls may place a significant burden on our management and our internal resources 
in addition  as we grow internationally  we will have to expand our worldwide operations and enhance our communications infrastructure 
any delay in the implementation of such new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  or any disruption in the transition to such new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could adversely affect our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
extreme must develop and expand its indirect distribution channels to increase revenues and improve its operating results our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and expanding indirect distribution channels through resellers  distributors and  to a lesser extent  original equipment manufacturers  or oems  as well as expanding our field sales organization 
if we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant resellers  or if these resellers are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer 
many of our resellers also sell products that compete with our products 
we are developing a two tier distribution structure in europe and the united states which has and will require us to enter into agreements with a small number of stocking distributors 
we have entered into two tier distribution agreements  however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to enter into additional distribution agreements or that we will be able to successfully manage the transition of resellers to a two tier distribution channel 
our failure to do so could limit our ability to grow or sustain revenue 
in addition  our operating results will likely fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and amount of orders from our resellers 
we cannot assure you that our resellers will market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
to support and develop leads for our indirect distribution channels and to expand our direct sales effort  to service providers and content providers  we plan to continue to expand our field sales and support staff significantly 
we cannot assure you that this internal expansion will be successfully completed  that the cost of this expansion will not exceed the revenues generated or that our expanded sales and support staff will be able to compete successfully against the significantly more extensive and well funded sales and marketing operations of many of our current or potential competitors 
our inability to effectively establish our distribution channels or manage the expansion of our sales and support staff would materially adversely affect our ability to grow and increase revenue 
because substantially all of extreme s revenue is derived from sales of two product families  extreme is dependent on widespread market acceptance of these products  future performance will depend on the introduction and acceptance of new products in fiscal  we derived substantially all of our revenue from sales of our summit and blackdiamond product families 
we expect that revenue from these product families will account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  widespread market acceptance of our product families is critical to our future success 
factors that may affect the market acceptance of our products include market acceptance of switching products  and gigabit ethernet and layer switching technologies in particular in the enterprise  service provider and metropolitan area network markets  the performance  price and total cost of ownership of our products  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  and the success and development of our resellers  distributors  oems and field sales channels 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
our future performance will also depend on the successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address customer requirements in a cost effective manner 
we have in the past experienced delays in product development and such delays may occur in the future 
we introduced a new product family in fiscal which is based on a new generation chip set 
in addition  we also introduced new products within our existing product lines that incorporate this new chip set 
the introduction of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for existing products 
therefore  to the extent customers defer or cancel orders in the expectation of any new product release  any delay in development or introduction could cause our operating results to suffer 
failure of our existing or future products to maintain and achieve widespread levels of market acceptance may significantly impair our revenue growth 
if a key reseller  distributor  oem or other significant customer cancels or delays a large purchase  extreme s revenues may decline and the price of its stock may fall to date  a limited number of resellers  distributors  oems and other customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
if any of our large customers stop or delay purchases  our revenue and profitability would be adversely affected 
for example  in fiscal  compaq and hitachi cable accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
because our expense levels are based on our expectations as to future revenue and to a large extent are fixed in the short term  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to  or the loss of any significant reseller  distributor  oem or other customer  or unexpected returns from resellers could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
although our largest customers may vary from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a small number of customers  particularly in light of the high sales price per unit of our products and the length of our sales cycles 
while our financial performance depends on large orders from a few key resellers  distributors  oems and other significant customers  we do not have binding commitments from any of them 
for example 
our service provider and enterprise network customers can stop purchasing and our resellers  distributors and oems can stop marketing our products at any time  
our reseller agreements generally are not exclusive and are for one year terms  with no obligation of the resellers to renew the agreements  
our reseller agreements provide for discounts based on expected or actual volumes of products purchased or resold by the reseller in a given period  and 
our reseller  distributor and oem agreements generally do not require minimum purchases 
we have established a program which  under specified conditions  enables some third party resellers to return products to us 
the amount of potential product returns is estimated and provided for in the period of the sale 
some of our oem agreements also provide manufacturing rights and access to our source code upon the occurrence of specified conditions of default 
if we were to default on these agreements  our oems could use our source code to develop and manufacture competing products  which would negatively affect our performance and ability to compete 
the sales cycle for extreme s products is long and extreme may incur substantial non recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated the timing of our sales revenue is difficult to predict because of our reliance on indirect sales channels and the length and variability of our sales cycle 
our products have a relatively high sales price per unit  and often represent a significant and strategic decision by an enterprise regarding its communications infrastructure 
accordingly  the purchase of our products typically involves significant internal procedures associated with the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
this evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales process  typically ranging from three months to longer than a year  and subjects the sales cycle associated with the purchase of our products to a number of significant risks  including budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews 
the length of our sales cycle also may vary substantially from customer to customer 
while our customers are evaluating our products and before they may place an order with us  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort 
consequently  if sales forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  we may be unable to compensate for the shortfall  which could harm our operating results 
extreme purchases several key components for products from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these sources fail to fill its needs we currently purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources and are dependent upon supply from these sources to meet our needs 
certain components such as tantalum capacitors  sram and printed circuit boards have been and may in the future be in short supply 
while we have been able to meet our needs to date  we have in the past and are likely in the future to encounter shortages and delays in obtaining these or other components and this could materially adversely affect our ability to meet customer orders 
our principal sole sourced components include

microprocessors  
programmable integrated circuits  
selected other integrated circuits  
cables  and 
custom tooled sheet metal 
our principal limited sourced components include 
flash memories  
dynamic and static random access memories  commonly known as drams and srams  respectively  and 
printed circuit boards 
we use a rolling six month forecast based on anticipated product orders to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
if orders do not match forecasts  we may have excess or inadequate inventory of certain materials and components  which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
from time to time we have experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in filling orders 
in addition  during the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our asics  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
extreme needs to expand its manufacturing operations and depends on contract manufacturers for substantially all of its manufacturing requirements if the demand for our products continues to grow  we will need to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions 
any disruptions in product flow could limit our revenue  adversely affect our competitive position and reputation and result in additional costs or cancellation of orders under agreements with our customers 
we rely on third party manufacturing vendors to manufacture our products 
we currently subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to three companies flextronics international  ltd  located in san jose  california  mcms  inc  located in boise  idaho and solectron  located in milpitas  california 
we have experienced a delay in product shipments from contract manufacturers in the past  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
we may in the future experience similar or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any of which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that we will effectively manage our contract manufacturers or that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products or the loss of either of our contract manufacturers would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
as part of our cost reduction efforts  we will need to realize lower per unit product costs from our contract manufacturers as a result of volume efficiencies 
however  we cannot be certain when or if such price reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such price reductions would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
if extreme loses key personnel or is unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  it may not be able to successfully manage its business or achieve its objectives our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing and manufacturing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
in particular  we believe that our future success is highly dependent on gordon stitt  chairman  president and chief executive officer  stephen haddock  vice president and chief technical officer  and herb schneider  vice president of engineering 
we neither have employment contracts with nor key person life insurance on any of our key personnel 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  especially in the san francisco bay area  and we have had difficulty hiring employees in the timeframe we desire  particularly software engineers 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as product introductions  on time 
in addition  companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we have from time to time received claims like this from other companies and  although to date they have not resulted in material litigation  we cannot assure you that we will not receive additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel or that such claims will not result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against any such claims  regardless of the merits of such claims 
extreme s products must comply with evolving industry standards and complex government regulations or its products may not be widely accepted  which may prevent extreme from sustaining its revenues or achieving profitability the market for network equipment products is characterized by the need to support industry standards as different standards emerge  evolve and achieve acceptance 
we will not be competitive unless we continually introduce new products and product enhancements that meet these emerging standards 
in the past  we have introduced new products that were not compatible with certain technological changes  and in the future we may not be able to effectively address the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards 
in addition  in the united states  our products must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the federal communications commission and underwriters laboratories 
internationally  products that we develop may be required to comply with standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries as well as with recommendations of the international telecommunication union 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards or if we fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates we would not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenues or achieving profitability 
failure to successfully integrate extreme s expanded sales and support organizations into its operation or educate them about its product families will hurt its operating results 
our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at several levels within a prospective customer s organization 
unless we expand our sales force we will not be able to increase revenues 
in april  a significant number of former sales and system engineer employees of another networking company joined our operation 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to educate these new employees about our product families or integrate these new employees into our company 
a failure to do so will hurt our revenue growth and may hurt our operating results 
extreme depends upon international sales for much of its revenue and extreme s ability to sustain and increase its international sales depends on successfully expanding its international operations our ability to grow will depend in part on the expansion of international sales and operations which have and are expected to constitute a significant portion of our sales 
sales to customers outside of north america accounted for approximately and of our net revenue in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our international sales primarily depend on our resellers  distributors and oems 
the failure of our resellers  distributors and oems to sell our products internationally would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue 
in addition  there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including 
longer accounts receivable collection cycles  
difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  
difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  
payment of operating expenses in local currencies  which subjects us to risks of currency fluctuations  
import or export licensing requirements  
potential adverse tax consequences  and 
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
our international sales currently are us dollar denominated 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
in the future  we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency which will subject us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the particular local currency 
if we do so  we may determine to engage in hedging transactions to minimize the risk of such fluctuations 
however  if we are not successful in managing such hedging transactions  we could incur losses from hedging activities 
because we currently denominate sales in us dollars  we do not anticipate that the adoption of the euro as a functional legal currency of certain european countries will materially affect our business 
extreme may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders  cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that would complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
we are reviewing investments in new businesses and we expect to make investments in and acquire businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could 
issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  
incur substantial debt 
assume contingent liabilities  or 
expend significant cash 
these actions by us could materially adversely affect our operating results and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks  including 
difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies or products  
unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction  
diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  
adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  
risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 
potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations  and 
substantial charges for amortization of goodwill or purchased intangibles or similar items 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and our failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
extreme may need additional capital to fund its future operations and  if it is not available when needed  extreme may need to reduce its planned development and marketing efforts  which may reduce its revenues and prevent extreme from achieving profitability we believe that our existing working capital  proceeds from the initial public offering in april  proceeds from the secondary offering in october and cash available from credit facilities and future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if cash from future operations is insufficient  or if cash is used for acquisitions or other currently unanticipated uses  we may need additional capital 
the development and marketing of new products and the expansion of reseller and distribution channels and associated support personnel is expected to require a significant commitment of resources 
in addition  if the market for our products were to develop more slowly than anticipated or if we fail to establish significant market share and achieve a meaningful level of revenues  we may continue to utilize significant amounts of capital 
as a result  we could be required to raise substantial additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the term of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
we cannot assure you that such additional capital  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain such additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which would harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
if extreme s products contain undetected software or hardware errors  extreme could incur significant unexpected expenses and lost sales network products frequently contain undetected software or hardware errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have experienced such errors in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades 
we expect that such errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may materially adversely affect our business by causing us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and causing significant customer relations problems 
our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
the occurrence of hardware and software errors  whether caused by our products or another vendor s products  could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may result in the incurrence of significant expenses 
the occurrence of any such problems would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
extreme s limited ability to protect its intellectual property may adversely affect its ability to compete we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
provisions in extreme s charter or agreements may delay or prevent a change of control provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management 
these provisions include 
the division of the board of directors into three separate classes  
the right of the board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors  and 
the ability of the board of directors to alter our bylaws without getting stockholder approval furthermore  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of the outstanding voting stock  from consummating a merger or combination with a corporation unless this stockholder receives board approval for the transaction or of the shares of voting stock not owned by the stockholder approve the merger or combination 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  other non government debt securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of june  and june  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
june  maturing in three months three months greater than fair or less to one year one year total value in thousands included in cash and cash equivalents    weighted average interest rate included in short term investments    weighted average interest rate included in investments    weighted average interest rate maturing in june  three months three months greater than fair or less to one year one year total value in thousands included in cash and cash equivalents    weighted average interest rate included in short term investments    weighted average interest rate included in investments    weighted average interest rate exchange rate sensitivity currently  all of our sales and the majority of our expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the year ended june  and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date  however  we may do so in the future
