the amount of the additional payment  if any  would equal x the product of i the amount by which the transaction proceeds as defined herein exceeds the imputed value as defined herein multiplied by ii the applicable item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued percentage ie  percent for the period from may  through may  multiplied by iii the number of shares of old pulitzer common stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of old pulitzer class b common stock owned by the selling stockholders  adjusted for  among other things  stock dividends and stock splits  less y the sum of any additional payments previously received by the selling stockholders  provided  however  that in the event of any recapitalization  dividend or distribution  the amount by which the transaction proceeds exceeds the imputed value shall not exceed the amount paid or distributed pursuant to such recapitalization  dividend or distribution in respect of one share of old pulitzer common stock 
the term transaction proceeds was defined to mean  in the case of a merger  the aggregate fair market value as defined herein of the consideration received pursuant thereto by the holder of one share of old pulitzer common stock  and  in the case of a recapitalization  dividend or distribution  the aggregate fair market value of the amounts paid or distributed in respect of one share of old pulitzer common stock plus the aggregate fair market value of one share of old pulitzer common stock following such transaction 
the imputed value for one share of old pulitzer common stock on a given date was defined to mean an amount equal to compounded annually from may  to such given date at the rate of percent per annum  the result of which is at may  there was no specific provision for adjustment of the amount  but if it were adjusted to reflect all stock dividends and stock splits of old pulitzer since september   it would have equaled  which if compounded annually from may  at the rate of percent per annum would have equaled at may  fair market value  in the case of any consideration other than cash received in a gross up transaction  was defined to mean the fair market value thereof as agreed to by a valuation firm selected by old pulitzer and a valuation firm selected by the selling stockholders  or  if the two valuation firms do not agree on the fair market value  the fair market value of such consideration as determined by a third valuation firm chosen by the two previously selected valuation firms

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary raw material used in the company s operations is newsprint  representing approximately percent of operating expenses 
the company consumed approximately  metric tons of newsprint during at an average cost of approximately per metric ton

in the last five years  the company s average cost per ton of newsprint has varied from a low of per metric ton in to a high of per metric ton in the company attempts to obtain the best price available by combining newsprint purchases for its different newspaper locations but does not enter into derivative contracts in an attempt to reduce the impact of year to year price fluctuations on its consolidated newsprint expense 
as of december   the company had no outstanding debt and a combined balance of cash and marketable securities of approximately million 
approximately million of these funds was used to purchase the pantagraph in january the company anticipates funding other potential newspaper acquisitions with a portion of the available cash

these investments expose the company to market risks that may cause the future value of these investments to be lower than the original cost of such investments at the time of purchase
