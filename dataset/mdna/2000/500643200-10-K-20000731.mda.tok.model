these expenditures consisted primarily of systems hardware and software costs  upgrades to information systems and leasehold improvements

included in cash flows from investing activities are premiums paid on corporate owned life insurance  or coli  contracts 
we purchase coli contracts to provide a funding vehicle for anticipated payments due under our deferred executive compensation programs 
premiums on these coli contracts were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
generally  we borrow against the cash surrender value of the coli contracts to fund the coli premium payments to the extent interest expense on the borrowings is deductible for us income tax purposes 
the fluctuation in premium payments over the past three fiscal years is attributable to the timing of payments 
cash flows from investing activities also include the investment of excess cash in marketable securities

the euro trades on currency exchanges and the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period which expires january  during the transition period  cashless payments can be made in the euro  and parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
between january  and october   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
we have assessed our information technology systems and determined that they allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro and accommodate the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies 
our currency risk may be affected as the legacy currencies are converted to the euro 
accounting  tax and governmental legal and regulatory guidance generally has not been provided in final form and we will continue to evaluate issues involving introduction of the euro throughout the transition period 
the conversion to the euro has not had a significant impact on our operations to date 
recently issued accounting standards during  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes new standards for reporting derivative and hedging information 
the standard is effective for periods beginning after june  and will be adopted by us as of may  we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements or require additional disclosure since we do not currently utilize derivative instruments or participate in structured hedging activities 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop provides guidance over accounting for computer software developed or obtained for internal use including the requirement to capitalize specified costs and amortization of such costs 
we adopted sop in fiscal the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements or our capitalization policy 
the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus in march on issue no eitf  accounting for web site development costs 
eitf provides guidance over accounting for web site development costs similar to the requirements of sop and is effective for fiscal quarters beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of its global operating activities  we are exposed to market risks  including changes in foreign currency fluctuations  fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships 
we manage our exposure to these risks in the normal course of our business as described below 
we have not utilized financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we trade in derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk generally  financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are measured in their local currencies 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of each year and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the year 
resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of comprehensive income 
financial results of foreign subsidiaries in countries with highly inflationary economies are measured in us dollars 
the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated using a combination of current and historical rates of exchange and any translation adjustments are included in determining net income 
historically  we have not experienced any significant translation gains or losses on transactions involving us dollars and other currencies 
this is primarily due to natural hedges of revenues and expenses in the functional currencies of the countries in which our offices are located and investment of excess cash balances in us dollar denominated accounts 
in fiscal  we recognized a foreign currency loss of million after tax of which million is related to our operations in europe 
this european translation loss was mainly due to the translation of european intercompany payables denominated in us dollars and reflected the significant appreciation of the us dollar against substantially all european currencies in fiscal we mitigate any realized loss through the timing of repayment of these intercompany borrowings 
interest rate risk we primarily manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through our regular financing activities that generally are short term and provide for variable market rates 
we have no outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit as of april  at april    was payable on long term notes payable to shareholders through fiscal at variable market rates 
of this amount   matures in fiscal   matures in fiscal   matures in and matures in we have investments in interest bearing securities at market rates with original maturities ranging from may through october and an average maturity period of less than three months
