impact of recent accounting pronouncements in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas was issued

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we receive united states dollars for substantially all of our product sales and our licensing revenues 
inventory purchases from offshore contract manufacturers are primarily denominated in united states dollars  however  purchase prices for the products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods in the future 
in addition  royalties received from our international licensees are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations as a result of the net sales of the licensee being denominated in local currency and royalties being paid to us in united states dollars 
during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on our inventory costs 
we may enter into derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  to manage foreign exchange risk on foreign currency transactions 
these financial instruments can be used to protect us from the risk that the eventual net cash inflows from the foreign currency transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
unrealized gains and losses on outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts  used to hedge future revenues and purchases  are not recorded in the financial statements but are included in the measurement of the related hedged transaction when realized
