item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company provides ultrahigh pressure uhp systems and related products and services to a wide variety of industries 
waterjet cutting is recognized as a better alternative to traditional cutting methods such as saws  plasma or laser systems 
it is faster  has greater versatility in the types of products it can cut and eliminates the need for secondary processing operations 
the company divides its uhp revenues into two primary categories of product  uhp systems and uhp consumable parts and services 
in addition to uhp revenue  the company s fiscal consolidated revenues also include the non core access and services operations that were sold in september consolidated revenues by major product categories year ended april  in thousands revenues revenues revenues uhp systems    uhp consumable parts and services    total uhp revenues    access and services  total consolidated revenues    fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for the year ended april  were million  an increase of million over the prior year period 
this growth was the result of recent acquisitions  as well as revenues generated from the recently commercialized food safety technology  fresher under pressure r 
the company acquired flow pressure systems vasteras ab pressure systems in march and spearhead automated systems spearhead in september excluding acquisitions and fresher under pressure  revenues decreased both domestically and internationally  however  this performance was better than the overall machine cutting tool market 
the united states machine cutting tool market declined for the months ended april  according to the association for manufacturing technology amt 
flow s uhp technology continued to gain market share in spite of a decreasing market 
the company s revenues can be segregated into two primary categories  systems sales and consumables sales 
systems are generally comprised of a pump along with the robotics or articulation used to move the cutting or cleaning head 
systems are further broken down between standard systems such as the bengal registered tradmark  integrated flying bridge  a series  waterjet machining center r wmc and standard automotive systems  and special or custom designed systems used primarily in the aerospace and automotive markets 
uhp systems also include food safety revenues  as well as isostatic press systems 
systems sales in fiscal were million  an increase of million over the prior year 
excluding acquisitions and fresher under pressure  systems revenues were down slightly 
consumables are primarily parts used by the pump and cutting head during operation 
consumable parts and services revenues increased million to million in fiscal the slowdown in the consumable sales growth reflects a decrease in the worldwide machine tool market  as well as the company s goal of providing lower operating costs through longer lived parts 
total domestic revenues increased to million and represented of fiscal sales 
european revenues posted a gain to million and represented of total revenues 
asian revenues increased to million and accounted for of consolidated revenues 
sales in the remainder of the world  primarily canada  mexico and south america  decreased to million 
growth in both the domestic and european markets resulted from recent acquisitions 
while waterjet technology continues to gain market share due to its advantages over traditional cutting technologies  its sales growth year over year is affected by the overall performance of the machine cutting tool market 
according to amt data  it appears that the machine cutting tool market is beginning to rebound as compared to the prior year 
while the company s sales growth rate has historically exceeded the cutting tool market  the company s fiscal performance will be affected by the extent of the broader machine tool market rebound 
the company typically sells its products at higher prices outside the united states due to the costs of servicing these markets 
the company did not significantly raise prices during fiscal fiscal revenues included million related to food safety or fresher under pressure 
by exposing foods to pressures up to  pounds per square inch psi for a short time  typically seconds to slightly more than two minutes  uhp achieves the effects of pasteurization without heat 
not only are spoilage microorganisms destroyed  but the process also destroys harmful pathogens such as e 
coli  listeria and salmonella  thus increasing shelf life  while ensuring a safe  healthy product 
unlike thermal treatment pasteurization or other methods such as irradiation  uhp technology does not destroy or alter the nutritional qualities  taste  texture or color of the food 
flow has a continuous flow concept whereby pumpable foods such as juices  salsas  guacamole  liquid eggs and salad dressings are pumped into pressure chambers  pressurized and then pumped into the next stage of the process  such as bottling 
this continuous flow process is fully automated and requires just a single operator 
the company also has the ability to uhp process non pumpable foods as a result of the march acquisition of pressure systems 
pressure systems provides flow the patented large vessel technology to make batch systems 
this makes flow the only supplier of complete uhp systems to the food industry 
the company anticipates leasing the continuous flow systems and selling the batch systems 
the leases have a fixed monthly charge plus a per gallon or per pound usage fee 
lease revenue is recognized monthly based on throughput 
revenue for the batch systems is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
in total  the company has over pressure vessels in operation or on order 
management also anticipates fresher under pressure revenues will double each year for the next three years 
gross profit for the year ended april  increased million 
gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal in general  gross margin rates on systems sales are less than and on consumables sales are in excess of 
on average  standard systems carry higher margins than the custom engineered systems  which include the isostatic pressure vessels manufactured by pressure systems 
as such  the gross margin percentage varies depending on the revenue mix between systems  both standard and special  and consumables sales 
systems sales represented of fiscal revenues  up from in the prior year  and consumables sales represented of fiscal revenues  down from in the prior year 
the decrease in current year gross margin was a function of the shift in revenue towards a greater percentage of systems sales  as well as the inclusion of the isostatic press systems in fiscal excluding pressure systems and spearhead  operating expenses increased  as compared to the prior year 
expressed as a percentage of revenues  total operating expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal marketing expenses of million increased million as compared to the prior year  and expressed as a percentage of revenues  decreased to from in the prior year

general and administrative expenses of million increased million for the year as compared to the prior year 
expressed as a percentage of revenues however  general and administrative expenses were comparable to the prior year at 
operating income can vary significantly for domestic and foreign operations  but is primarily the result of product mix variations and volume from year to year 
management continues to monitor the economic situation throughout all principal geographic areas 
the domestic machine tool market experienced weakness in fiscal  but appeared to begin to rebound during the fourth quarter of fiscal while the company s business has historically performed better than the overall market  fiscal domestic performance will be affected by the strength and timing of the rebound in the machine cutting tool market 
fiscal european growth is expected to continue but at a lower level than in fiscal net interest expense of million increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in interest expense is due to higher debt levels associated with the purchase of pressure systems and spearhead  as well as additional financing related to the development of the fresher under pressure program  and increased interest rates 
during fiscal  other expense  net  totaled million compared to other expense  net  of  in fiscal this change is due to the increase in the minority interest for majority owned joint ventures 
for both fiscal and fiscal  the provision for income taxes was of income before tax 
the income tax rates were lower than the statutory rates in both the current and prior years due primarily to lower foreign tax rates and benefits from the foreign sales corporation 
additionally  the company regularly evaluates the likelihood of utilizing its deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowance thereon based on an evaluation of both positive and negative evidence related to these deferred tax assets

weakness in the automotive and aerospace markets account for this decrease 
in addition  the average standard domestic system selling price has decreased by as the lower cost systems  such as the integrated flying bridge and bengal  now deliver improved accuracy and feature enhancements that were formerly found only on the more expensive models 
consumable parts and services revenues increased million to million in fiscal the consumable parts increase reflects the expanding base of waterjet systems installed throughout the world 
domestically  revenues increased to million and represented of fiscal sales 
this increase in revenues was achieved in spite of a decrease in the us cutting machine tool market for the months ended april  according to the amt 
the company did  however  experience weakness domestically during the fourth quarter of fiscal with an decline in domestic sales as compared to the prior year 
according to amt  the domestic cutting machine tool market dropped during the first calendar quarter of management believes the decline in fourth quarter domestic sales is a function of a tightening economy as opposed to a reduction in the benefits of the waterjet cutting technology over competitive technologies

liquidity and capital resources the company generated million in cash flow from operations during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal cash flow in fiscal was impacted by increases in both receivables and inventory as discussed further below  as well as reductions in accounts payable 
the company invested million in property and equipment during fiscal of which million related to fresher under pressure 
additionally  the company paid million  net of cash acquired  for spearhead 
total debt at april  was million  an increase of million from april  management believes that the available credit facilities and working capital generated by operations will provide sufficient resources to meet its operating and capital requirements for the next months 
the company s credit agreement and private placement require the company to comply with certain financial covenants 
the covenants were amended as a result of recent acquisitions 
as of april   the company was in compliance with all such covenants  as amended 
the fiscal consolidated statement of cash flows reflects the disposition of the access and services businesses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a schedule of long term debt maturities 
long term debt obligations are expected to be met from working capital provided by operations and  as necessary  by other indebtedness 
capital spending plans currently provide for outlays of approximately million to million in fiscal of this amount  approximately million to million relates to the manufacture of the continuous feed fresher under pressure assets 
the timing of these continuous feed asset additions will be determined by market demand 
it is expected that funds necessary for these expenditures will be generated internally and through available credit facilities 
gross receivables of million at april  increased million from april  this increase is a function of the increase in sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to fiscal days sales outstanding in gross accounts receivable is negatively impacted by the traditionally longer payment cycle outside the united states 
additionally  longer payment terms are sometimes negotiated on large system orders 
management does not believe these timing issues will present a material adverse impact on the company s short term liquidity requirements 
inventory of million at april  represents an increase of million compared to april  excluding the september spearhead acquisition  inventories were flat as compared to april  certain products manufactured by pressure systems and the company s robotics and automation divisions require an extended manufacturing period  and therefore involve higher levels of work in process 
year issues to date  the company has not experienced any material issues with respect to year that have effected the ongoing operations 
throughout the remainder of year  there may be dates which do cause interruptions or failures that could materially impact normal business operations

recently issued accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  is effective beginning in fiscal  with early adoption permitted 
fas standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that an entity recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure them at fair value 
the company is currently reviewing the requirements of fas and assessing its impact on the company s financial statements 
the company has not made a decision regarding the period of adoption 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies 
management is evaluating the impact of sab and will adopt this statement no later than february  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exists in the company s financial instruments related to an increase in interest rates  adverse changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar  as well as financial risk management and derivatives 
these exposures are related to the daily operations of the company 
interest rate exposure at april  the company had million in interest bearing debt 
of this amount  million was fixed rate debt with interest rates ranging from to per annum 
the remaining debt of million was variable with million of this total bearing a rate of libor or at april  the majority of the remaining floating rate debt was at prime  
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional contractual information on the company s debt obligations 
market risk is estimated as the potential for interest rates to increase on the variable rate debt 
a increase in interest rates would result in an approximate additional annual charge to the company s pretax profits and cash flow of  at april  the company had no derivative instruments to offset the risk of interest rate changes 
the company may choose to use derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage the risk associated with interest rate changes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company transacts business in various foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  the german mark  the japanese yen  the new taiwan dollar  and the swedish crown 
the assets and liabilities of its foreign operations  with functional currencies other than the us dollar  are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
aggregate transaction gains and losses included in the determination of net income have not been material 
based on the company s overall currency rate exposure at april   a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
at april   the company had several derivative instruments to offset the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the company may continue to use derivative instruments  such as forward exchange rate contracts  to manage the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
management s statement of responsibility management is responsible for the fair and accurate presentation of information in this form k 
the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
financial and operating information comes from company records and other sources 
certain amounts are  of necessity  based on judgment and estimation 
we believe that adequate accounting systems and financial controls are maintained to ensure that the company s records are free from material misstatement and to protect the company s assets from loss or unauthorized use 
in addition  the audit committee of the board of directors periodically meets with pricewaterhousecoopers llp and management to review the work of each  to discuss financial reporting matters  and to review auditing and internal control procedures
