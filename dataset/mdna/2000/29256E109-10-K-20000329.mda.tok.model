the most current technology is employed to provide the visibility required throughout the company to plan for and manage rapid growth 
encore has expanded its full line of total joint implants to cover knee  hip and shoulder applications 
in addition  in may  encore acquired all of the assets and liabilities of applied osteo systems  inc aos  an orthopedic company with products in the trauma implant area  in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interest 
in march  encore acquired substantially all of the stock of bti  a company that had developed several trauma products 
this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
encore merged with healthcare acquisition corp 
hcac in march  which was treated as a recapitalization of encore for financial statement purposes 
all financial information included herein reflects these transactions 
encore has developed a network of independent sales representatives and direct sales persons that sell encore s products throughout the united states 
encore has also established relationships with several international stocking distributors 
encore must receive k or pma approval from the fda for every product that it desires to sell in the united states and similar regulatory approvals in other countries in which it sells its products 
encore has received such approvals for all of its products that it currently markets 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales were  for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  or compared to total sales of  for the year ended december  this decrease in absolute sales reflects two different trends for encore sales 
on one hand  us sales increased over more productive sales territories  an increase in the number of sales territories and an increase in the number of products offered for sale fueled the increase in us sales 
on the other hand  outside the us  sales decreased compared to the year ended december  this was mainly due to the significant decrease in the sales of encore s former primary distributor for europe 
this relationship was changed in the summer of and encore is actively engaged in pursuing alternative avenues for international distribution to remedy this situation 
encore has recently entered into distribution agreements for france and the middle east and is actively engaged in negotiations with other distributors for other countries in europe 
in addition  encore had terminated its relationship with its distributor for total joint products in japan as of december  during  encore located and contracted with a new  highly experienced sales distribution company for carrying not only encore s total joint lines of products  but also its new trauma products that it acquired when it acquired the trauma specialty company bti 
this sales force will complement the other japanese sales force that is distributing encore s specialty trauma line of intramedullary rods and external fixation system 
overall  while sales of reconstructive products decreased to  in  this decrease masks the significant increase in hip sales for encore 
these products were significantly aided by the addition of several new products that were introduced during and showed strong sales growth in the overall decrease in total joint sales was fueled by decreased sales of the foundation r total knee systems which were the only product being sold by encore s former european distributor 
another strong indication of the progress that encore made during is that trauma product sales have increased over this increase was a result of having a broader product line  in part due to the acquisition of bti  and having the products gain more acceptance throughout the united states 
another factor in the increased us sales was the transition from a non exclusive to an exclusive sales force 
going forward  rapid geographical expansion in the united states  an improvement in the quality of the sales force  adding new international distributors who will carry the full encore product line and introduction of new products will fuel additional increases in sales in both the total joint and trauma segments of the business 
additionally  encore received several of the needed fda approvals to market spinal products during the later half of and will be able to bring these products to the united states during as an indication of the fiscal management and cost control that encore exercised during  gross margin as a percent of sales increased in even though sales overall decreased 
gross margin was of sales in compared to of sales for this was due both to the increase in us sales  which generate a greater gross margin than sales outside the us  and continued monitoring of manufacturing costs 
even with a decrease in sales for  encore kept up its strong research and development program since it recognizes that new products are the lifeblood of expansion of an orthopedics company 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased to in from in current activities include a joint design effort with norton desmarquest fine ceramics to develop a ceramic knee femoral component to address the issue of polyethylene wear in the knee  clinical trials for a ceramic ceramic hip system and a metal metal hip system  development of a mobile bearing knee  development of a revision hip system and regulatory submissions for spine 
part of controlling expenses in a year when sales decreased was that selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  in when compared to the same period in while a part of this decrease came from lower commissions and royalties associated with the overall decrease in sales  significant portions of the savings came from management efforts undertaken in for example  the company incurred costs in relating to consigned inventory discrepancies 
discrepancy charges in were insignificant 
as a result of the fiscal management of encore during a year of decreasing sales  operating income as a percent of sales increased to as compared to of 
so even though sales decreased by  operating income only decreased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  interest expense increased by  in compared to this was due to an increase during in the average line of credit balance over the same period last year and the addition of interest on notes payable related to the acquisition of bti on march  other income increased  in due to licensing income and favorable foreign exchange gains 
the total effect of the decrease in sales coupled with the strong fiscal management of encore was that net income as a percent of sales increased to in from in in pure dollar terms  net income for the year ended december   decreased to  from  in year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales were  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or over the year ended december  in  us sales and sales outside the us increased and  respectively  over the increase in us sales was fueled primarily by the growth of the us sales force in the number of sales agents and more productive sales territories 
outside the us  the economic environment that existed in asia affected sales 
however  sales to the japanese market rebounded substantially in the fourth quarter with the addition of new distribution  which was experienced in the orthopedic market 
sales of reconstructive products increased to  in  led by the foundation r total knee  hip and shoulder systems 
trauma product sales remained relatively flat 
the increase in reconstructive products was attributed primarily to the expansion of the us sales force 
continued transition from a non exclusive to an exclusive sales force was a major factor for the flat sales of trauma products 
gross margin increased to  in  or of sales  as compared to  or of sales for gross margin as a percent of sales decreased slightly due to discounts and higher costs associated with the initial production of the revelation tm and linear r hip systems 
research and development expenses increased by  or in when compared to the same period in research and development activities increased to complete the design of two new hip stems and two acetabular systems that were released in early the company effectively balanced the increased activity at the beginning of the year with expenditures in the remainder of the year to control expenses relative to sales by the end of activities included a joint design effort with norton desmarquest fine ceramics to develop a ceramic knee femoral component to address the issue of polyethylene wear in the knee 
initiation of activities that address polyethylene wear in the hip included a fda feasibility study for metal metal articulation  as well as fda approval to begin full clinical studies for metal metal and ceramic ceramic hips 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  in when compared to the same period in this increase was due to additional instrumentation depreciation and continued investment in the development of the us sales infrastructure  increase in commission and royalty expenses in conjunction with the increase in sales  costs associated with unsuccessful acquisition attempts and a charge for inventory discrepancies at consigned locations 
operating income increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was due to increased gross margins  which was partially offset by increased operating expenses 
interest expense decreased by  in compared to this was primarily related to the existence of million in term debt in the first five months of  which was paid off as of the end of may in addition  both a higher effective interest rate and the amortization of the related debt discount in the prior year affected the decrease in interest expense 
income before extraordinary item decreased slightly to  in from  in it is important to note that the result includes a one time benefit of  from the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
absent such one time event  income before extraordinary item in would have been  there was no extinguishment of debt expense for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in during the second quarter of  the company repaid million of long term debt plus accrued interest of  the company had previously capitalized approximately  of financing costs and established a debt discount of  associated with detachable put warrants issued in accordance with the debt 
the unamortized portions of these two items were expensed in conjunction with the repayment of the debt  resulting in an extraordinary charge to earnings of  which was net of an income tax benefit of  net income for the year ended december  increased to  from  in capital expenditures encore has spent a significant amount of its resources over the past several years on building a state of the art  fully integrated orthopedic implant company 
these expenditures have included the investment in surgical instrumentation  machine tools to increase manufacturing capacity  computer hardware and software  and equipment required to support a growing organization 
over the last several years  encore has acquired machine tools primarily through capital leases 
encore has made significant investments in surgical instrumentation  as such instrumentation is necessary to implant encore reconstructive products 
also  the size of the sales force and the increases in the product lines have necessitated increases in the need for additional surgical instruments 
in the united states  these instruments are capitalized and depreciated 
they are loaned to the sales force without charge to aid in sales 
internationally  these instruments are sold or leased to distributors 
the amounts of surgical instruments capitalized in  and were   and  respectively 
other capital expenditures during those periods were   and  respectively 
as a growing organization  encore has devoted significant capital resources to expanding and improving its management information systems through additions of hardware and software 
in addition  during  encore dealt with yk issues 
the expenditures for these computer improvements were approximately  in   in and  in liquidity since its inception  the company has financed its operations through the sale of equity securities  borrowings and cash flow from operations 
the company has available to it a million revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company had drawn approximately million 
a distinguishing feature of the credit facility is that encore s cash management services are intermingled with it on a daily basis 
encore s bank accounts sweep funds to either reduce or increase the loan balance  as needed  and invests any excess funds if the loan balance equals zero  in a money market account 
as such  the outstanding loan balance is adjusted daily based on the net amount of cash receipts versus cash outlays  while the cash balance at wells fargo remains at zero as long as encore is a net borrower 
this sweep feature has the effect of minimizing interest cost and automatically investing any excess funds 
the company s continued strong growth has resulted in an increase in its capital requirements 
this growth is now primarily funded by the credit facility and cash generated from operations to meet its working capital needs 
as of december   the company had net working capital of approximately million as compared to approximately million at december  this increase was primarily due to the increases in inventory and a decrease in the current portion of a payment to a related party  and accounts payable and accrued expenses 
during the third quarter of and continuing in  the company began actively purchasing its equity securities  both common stock and warrants  in connection with the buyback program it announced at the beginning of this program was initiated because company management and the board of directors felt that the company s equity was undervalued 
the company repurchased  and  shares of common stock in and respectively  and  and  warrants during those periods  respectively 
this program is ongoing
