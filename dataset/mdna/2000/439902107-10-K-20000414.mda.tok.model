item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview 
horizon s principal business strategy since commencing operations in has been to establish a chain of retail pharmacies through the acquisition of full line retail pharmacies 
in evaluating a retail pharmacy for potential acquisition  we i evaluate the target store s profits and losses for preceding years  ii review the store s tax returns for preceding years  iii review computer generated prescription reports showing historical information including prescriptions sold  average price of each prescription  gross margins and trends in prescription sales  iv analyze the store s location and competition in the immediate area  v review the store s lease agreement  if any  and vi assess targeted areas for growth patterns and trends 
based on our analysis of the foregoing items  we prepare an offer to purchase the particular store 
to assess the reasonableness of the purchase price offered by a seller in connection with a potential acquisition  we consider the availability and terms of owner financing of approximately one third of the purchase price  including such terms as rate of return and payback period  with the balance split between cash and other consideration such as our common stock 
in  we made a strategic decision to enter the mail order and e commerce business 
in june  we purchased a combination retail  mail order and internet pharmacy operation for  and in the fourth quarter we started a new internet pharmacy operation  horizonscripts 
com  which will provide customers online access to thousands of prescription and non prescription items at competitive prices 
we believe this internet pharmacy will enhance our traditional brick and mortar operations  and that the brick and click strategy will offer our customers and potential customers convenient sources for the health care needs 
by expanding our presence through e commerce  we believe we will expand our name recognition and revenue base  while also cementing our relationship with our existing customers 
in  and we acquired  and retail pharmacies and  and related businesses  respectively 
these acquisitions are the principal influence on our results of operations and financial condition 
the primary measurement of the effect of acquisitions on our operating performance is the number of store operating months  which is the number of months we owned all of the stores counted during the relevant measuring period 
we expect that continuing acquisitions and expansion of our e commerce activities will be the most significant factors in our growth strategy 
currently  our primary source of revenue is the sale of prescription drugs 
during  sales of prescription drugs generated of our net revenues  during  prescription drug sales generated of revenues  and during  such sales generated of total net revenues 
we expect our prescription drug business to continue to increase on an annual basis as a result of the demographic trends toward an aging population and the continued development of new pharmaceutical products 
however  we anticipate that such sales will decrease as a percentage of our total net revenues and gross margins as we expand our home healthcare and other non pharmaceutical sales and services which have historically generated higher margins 
our revenues and profits should be higher during peak holiday periods and from christmas through easter 
sales of health related products peak during seasonal outbreaks of cough and cold flu viruses  which typically occur during the winter and spring 
accordingly  revenues and profits should be highest in the first and fourth quarters of each year 
we anticipate entering into strategic alliances with various e commerce companies  as well as pursuing e commerce strategies through existing retail centers  such as grocery stores 
we recently entered into a relationship with informed 
com  inc  an e commerce start up that provides telemedicine services eg  counseling and virtual nursing 
we will in essence serve as a wholesale supplier to informed 
com for their online prescription drug and otc drug orders  and in this capacity and in exchange for  shares of informed 
com common stock and a one time fee of million  and have guaranteed prescription volume levels to allow certain of informed 
com s revenue and gross margin targets will be met 
informed 
com will also provide us their e commerce expertise  as we design and develop kiosks to conduct e commerce in retail centers 
additionally  we also entered into a cooperative marketing agreement with egrocery 
com  inc pursuant to which egrocery 
com  inc 
will  among other things  link our web site to  and display promotional advertisements on  certain web sites operated and maintained by egrocery 
com  inc egrocery 
com  inc 
will also endeavor to generate cooperative advertising dollars for us from general merchandise  trade funds and display allowances at the retail stores we own and manage 
we will attempt to enter into additional alliances in fiscal in order to provide us increased visibility in cyberspace and access to high traffic retail centers for electronic kiosks to implement our strategies

net revenues 
our total net revenues increased  or  to  in compared to  in and  in the increases were attributable primarily to the increase in store operating months from in to in to in prescription drug sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal compared to  for fiscal and  for third party reimbursed sales accounted for approximately of our total prescription drugs sales in  as compared to in and in higher reimbursement sales have typically resulted in a decrease in gross margins due to the lower prices negotiated by third party payors 
in  the gross margin on prescription drug sales was down significantly due to unanticipated problems with our communications technology which prevented us from receiving daily updates of average wholesale pharmaceutical prices 
in  the gross margin on prescription drug sales was slightly improved over however  gross margins on prescription drug sales remained low due to price conversion difficulties encountered in the fourth quarter during our conversion to a new pharmacy computer system and to install a system with a home office function enabling centralized control on a daily basis for prescription pricing and margins 
the following tables show our prescription drug gross margins and total revenues margins for  and gross margins on gross margins on total prescription drug sales revenues year amount percentage amount percentage sales of prescription drugs decreased from of total revenues for to of total revenues for and increased to of total revenues for while there was an increase in prescription drug sales in as compared to due to the acquisition of the mail order and internet pharmacy in  we expect that prescription drug sales will decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we expand our home healthcare and other non pharmaceutical sales and services  whose gross margins exceed those of pharmaceutical sales 
same store sales for our first stores increased from  in to  in  an increase of 
same store sales for our first stores increased from  in to  in  an increase of 
management believes that these increases are primarily the result of increased advertising and promotions as well as an enhanced product mix 
we currently have non compete agreements with the previous owners of all of the stores we have acquired except for the marion and covington  virginia stores  which were acquired from the federal trade commission  and three stores located in mineola  mt 
vernon and mckinney  texas  which we acquired from true quality pharmacies  inc costs and expenses 
cost of sales increased  or  to  in as compared to  in and  in this increase is primarily the result of increased sales volume due to the increased number of store operating months for each respective period 
total cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues increased from in to in and increased by from in to in in  the increase in cost of sales was caused by unexpected communications technology problems in receiving updated pricing information from our primary supplier during the last quarter of as a result of the problems  our prescription prices to third party and cash customers were not increased when our cost of those prescription products increased 
the problem was identified in february of and corrected in march of by switching to another provider for updated pricing information 
as a result  our gross margin on prescription drug sales declined from in to in  with a significant portion of the decline attributable to the failure to receive updated pricing and the balance due to an increase in prescriptions reimbursed through third party providers 
in  we recovered a portion of the decline in gross margin that occurred in  however  a further recovery was deterred during the conversion of pharmacy computer systems in the fourth quarter of to install a system with a home office function enabling centralized control on a daily basis of prescription pricing and margins 
there was an increase of  in selling  general and administrative expenses from  in and  in and an increase of  from to  in a portion of the increase is due to increased store count and resulting increased store operating months 
a large portion of the increase approximately  is due to the cost associated with the conversion of pharmacy systems  the installation of a home office pharmacy system to monitor prescription drug costs  prices and margins  the installation of a frame relay telecommunications system which ties together our stores  home office and internet activities  additional personnel added to install  monitor and manage the new systems and the start up costs of horizonscripts

in total  these selling  general and administrative expenses  expressed as a percentage of net revenues  were  and for  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization was  in compared to  in and  in the increase primarily resulted from our acquisition of stores in and intangible assets  including but not limited to goodwill  pharmacy files and non compete covenants  have historically represented a substantial portion of our acquisition costs 
such assets are amortized over a period of not more than years 
accordingly  the amortization of intangible assets is not expected to have a significant effect on our future results of operations 
interest expense was  in compared to  in and  in the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the increase in our indebtedness associated with the acquisition of stores in and and for working capital as a result of the operating losses sustained in and during the fourth quarter of we determined that several under performing stores should be sold or closed and recorded a special charge of  for impairment losses 
additionally  we recorded an impairment provision of  on another store we plan to continue to operate 
earnings 
income loss before provision for income taxes was  of net revenues in   of net revenues in and  of net revenues in  which is a decrease of  and  respectively  in and because horizon operated as an s corporation prior to its initial public offering  it had not incurred any income taxes prior to such time 
as a result of the termination of its s corporation election in connection with the initial public offering  we became a taxpaying entity subject to the payment of taxes on all non exempt income at applicable federal and state income tax rates 
in  we incurred a noncash  one time charge for deferred income taxes of  as a result of the change in tax status 
in  we incurred a net loss of  as compared to a net loss of  in and net income of  after the one time noncash charge for deferred taxes of  in the loss in resulted from the provision for impairment  a decline in gross margin as a result of price conversion difficulties encountered during the pharmacy computer system conversions and the expenses associated with the pharmacy system conversion  the installation of the pharmacy home office computer system  the frame relay network and the start up expenses associated with our new web site  horizonscripts 
com 
the loss in resulted primarily from revenues which were lost when our computer system failed to receive and or process daily prescription drugs price updates transmitted electronically from our wholesale supplier 
liquidity and capital resources 
net cash used in operating activities was  in as compared to  in and  in the net losses in and  coupled with increased accounts receivable in each of such years  were primarily responsible for the increase in net cash used by operations 
the  net proceeds of a private placement that closed june  was used to support an aggressive store acquisition program and for working capital 
we believe that based on prior acquisitions  the average acquisition cost per store will be approximately  to  plus inventory based on such variables as store sales and profits 
management believes it will be able to obtain seller financing for approximately of the cost of each such acquisition 
mckesson currently provides us with a  credit facility  due in july and provides a guaranty for a  revolving credit facility from bank one  texas  na bank one due in july both the mckesson credit facility and the bank one revolving credit facility are subject to certain restrictive covenants including financial ratio requirements which we must meet to maintain the credit facility and revolving line of credit 
at december  we were in default of several of these covenants  but mckesson and bank one waived such defaults pursuant to agreements executed march  and april   respectively 
at march   we had borrowed  under the credit facility and  under the revolving credit facility 
during february  we acquired the prescription files and inventory of one store in gering  nebraska and consolidated it with our existing store 
however  as a result of the loss incurred in  we have readjusted our formula we use for acquisitions 
until we are able to raise additional capital or secure additional credit lines for acquisitions  we will seek acquisition opportunities that require less cash and rely more on seller financing and the public or private offering of certain equity or long term debt securities 
because of the federal moratorium on home healthcare licenses from september until january  and the uncertainty of the current regulations  we do not plan to expand our home healthcare operations in we do expect  however  to offer home medical equipment through stores which have not heretofore offered such equipment 
the company s plan for provides for the company to improve its financial condition and operating results through the sale or closure of several underperforming pharmacies including one pharmacy sold in march  increased selling prices  the reduction of receivables and inventories levels  reduction in store operating hours and labor costs and various debt and equity alternatives 
in april  the company issued  in convertible debentures which provided  in net proceeds 
as discussed above  the company s  revolving credit facility from bank one matures july  we believe that in the event that bank one does not renew or otherwise extend the credit facility  we will be able to secure replacement financing through a financial institution or supplier at similar terms or otherwise retire the debt with sales proceeds from stores identified as held for disposal in the fourth quarter of in the event such proceeds are not sufficient or that alternative financing is not arranged  we will sell the assets of certain performing stores which have previously received unsolicited purchase inquiries to provide the additional funds to retire the debt 
while the sale of such additional stores would reduce future revenues  we do not believe such reduction would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
impact of inflation and changing prices 
inflation continues to cause increases in revenues  as well as product  occupancy and operating expenses  as well as the cost of acquiring capital assets 
the effect of higher operating costs is minimized by achieving operating efficiencies and product price increases 
factors affecting operations 
dependence on acquisitions for growth 
our growth strategy is two fold 
first  when we can we will continue to acquire  consolidate and operate existing free standing pharmacies and related businesses on a profitable basis 
we continually review acquisition proposals and are currently engaged in discussions with third parties with respect to possible acquisitions 
we compete for acquisition candidates with buyers who have greater financial and other resources and may be able to pay higher acquisition prices than we are able to pay 
to the extent we are unable to acquire suitable retail pharmacies  or to successfully integrate such stores into our operations  our ability to expand our business may be reduced significantly 
in addition to seeking acquisition opportunities  we are also expanding our operations into  and attempting to redirect revenues through e commerce through strategic alliances with e commerce partners 
we believe this will allow us to increase both our customer and prescription bases and our revenues 
sales to third party payors 
we sell a growing percentage of our prescription drugs to customers who are covered by third party payment programs 
although contracts with third party payors may increase the volume of prescription drugs sales and gross profits  third party payors typically negotiate lower prescription prices than non third party payors 
accordingly  gross profit margins on sales of prescription drugs have been decreasing and are expected to continue to decrease in future periods 
reliance on medicare and medicaid reimbursements 
substantially all of our home healthcare revenues are attributable to third party payors  including medicare  medicaid  private insurers  managed care plans and hmos 
the amounts we receive from government programs and private third party payors are dependent upon the specific benefits included under the program or the patient s insurance policies 
any substantial delays in reimbursement or significant reductions in the coverage or payment rates of third party payors  or from patients enrolled in the medicare or medicaid programs  would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
expansion 
our ongoing expansion will require us to implement and integrate enhanced operational and financial systems  and additional management  operational and financial resources 
our inability to implement and integrate these systems and or add these resources could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expanding operations effectively or maintain or accelerate our growth 
although we experienced growth in net revenues in  and  and were profitable in  we sustained a substantial loss in  as a result of the decline in gross margins in the fourth quarter as a result of price conversion difficulties encountered during the pharmacy computer system conversions and the expenses associated with the conversions  the installation of the home office computer system  the installation of the frame relay telecommunication network  and the start up expenses associated with new pharmacy web site  horizonscripts 
com  and in  as a result of the malfunction of our computerized pricing system which failed to receive and or integrate average wholesale price updates electronically transmitted from our primary supplier 
while such malfunction has been corrected  there can be no assurance we will not experience other similar problems related to expansion or that we will be able to maintain or increase net revenues 
government regulation and healthcare reform 
pharmacists and pharmacies are subject to a variety of state and federal regulations and may be adversely affected by certain changes in such regulations 
in addition  prescription drug sales represent a significant portion of our revenues and profits and are a significant segment of our business 
these revenues are affected by regulatory changes  including changes in programs providing for reimbursement of the cost of prescription drugs by third party payment plans  such as government and private plans  and regulatory changes relating to the approval process for prescription drugs 
regulation of home healthcare services 
our home healthcare business is subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws could have a material effect on permissible activities  the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement for our products and services paid by government and other third party payors 
malpractice liability 
the provision of retail pharmacy and home healthcare services entails an inherent risk of claims of medical and professional malpractice liability 
we may be named as a defendant in such malpractice lawsuits and subject to the attendant risk of substantial damage awards 
while we believe we have adequate professional and medical malpractice liability insurance coverage  there can be no assurance that we will not be sued  that any such lawsuit will not exceed our insurance coverage  or that we will be able to maintain such coverage at acceptable costs and on favorable terms 
competition 
the retail pharmacy and home healthcare businesses are highly competitive 
we compete with national  regional and local retail pharmacy chains  independent retail pharmacies  deep discount retail pharmacies  supermarkets  discount department stores  mass merchandisers and other retail stores and mail order and internet operations 
similarly  our home healthcare operations compete with other larger providers of home healthcare services including chain operations and independent single unit stores which are more established in that market and which offer more extensive home healthcare services than we offer 
most of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours  and we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to successfully compete with such competitors 
geographic concentration 
currently  and of our retail pharmacies are located in texas and new mexico  respectively  and we plan to acquire other retail pharmacies located in such states 
consequently  our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon general trends in the texas and new mexico economies and any significant healthcare legislative proposals enacted in those states 
substantial indebtedness 
we have incurred substantial debt and may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with our plan of acquisitions 
our ability to make cash payments to satisfy our debt will depend upon our future operating performance  which is subject to a number of factors including prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
as discussed above  if we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to service such debt we may have to refinance certain of these obligations or dispose of certain assets 
in the event we are required to refinance all or any part of such debt  there can be no assurance that we will be able to effect such refinancing on satisfactory terms 
need for additional capital 
we believe that a planned reduction in inventory and accounts receivable levels and the sale of certain stores discussed above together with our existing credit facilities will be adequate to satisfy our working capital requirements for the next twelve months  although circumstances  including the acquisition of additional stores and certain alliances and or joint ventures in e commerce  will require that we obtain additional equity and or long or short term financing to realize certain business opportunities 
no assurance can be made that we will be able to obtain such financing 
reliance on single supplier 
we currently purchase approximately of our inventory from mckesson  which also provides us with order entry machines  shelf labels and other supplies and is our primary lender and guarantor of our indebtedness 
we believe that the wholesale pharmaceutical and non pharmaceutical distribution industry is highly competitive because of the consolidation of the retail pharmacy industry and the practice of certain large retail pharmacy chains to purchase directly from product manufacturers 
although we believe we could obtain our inventory through another distributor at competitive prices and upon competitive payment terms if our relationship with mckesson was terminated  there can be no assurance that the termination of such relationship would not adversely affect our business 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results  seasonality 
our results of operations depend significantly upon the net revenues generated during the first and fourth quarters  and any decrease in net revenues for such periods could have a material adverse effect upon our profitability 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not and will not necessarily be meaningful  and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt 
our exposure to interest rate risk currently consists of our outstanding borrowings under the mckesson credit facility and the bank one revolving line of credit 
the combined balance outstanding was  at december  the impact on our results of operations of a one point interest rate change on balances outstanding would be  on an annual basis 
this market risk discussion contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from this discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in financial markets
