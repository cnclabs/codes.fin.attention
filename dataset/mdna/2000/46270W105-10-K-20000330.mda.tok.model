item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in march of  we entered into a letter of intent to sell perceptive scientific instruments  our genetic analysis business 
in light of our plans to sell perceptive scientific instruments  we are treating this business as a discontinued operation for accounting purposes  and we have removed it from most of the discussion and financial information in this annual report 
for a further discussion of our plans to sell this business  please see the section below on page entitled discontinued business operations 
overview we generate revenues primarily from sales of the yellow iris urinalysis workstation  an ivd imaging system based on our patented and proprietary aim technology  and the related supplies and service required to operate this workstation 
we also earn revenues from sales of ancillary lines of small laboratory instruments and supplies 
until  we marketed just two models of the yellow iris urinalysis workstation 
these models differ mainly in speed and price 
in  we introduced a third model of the yellow iris  the model udx urine pathology system 
this model is a higher capacity automated urinalysis workstation designed especially for the high volume testing requirements of large hospitals and reference laboratories 
in december  we began distributing the iris sysmex uf urine cell analyzer in the united states under an exclusive agreement with its manufacturer  sysmex corporation 
we did not have significant sales of the uf in or in september  sysmex started procedures to end the exclusive nature of our distribution rights  claiming inadequate sales performance 
we denied these allegations 
sysmex has announced that its us subsidiary will distribute the uf in north america 
we may take legal action 
we cannot predict the impact on the company of this announcement or any legal action we may take 
because of the nature of our business  we make significant investments in research and development for new products and enhancements to existing products 
in the past  we have partially funded our research and development programs through grants from the national institutes of health  joint development programs with strategic partners and company sponsored research and development entities 
we anticipate that future expenditures on research and development will increase significantly and will be funded entirely out of the company s earnings 
see business research and development 
the following table summarizes total product technology expenditures for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands research and development expense  net    capitalized software development costs reimbursed costs for research and development grants and contracts 
total product technology expenditures    in  we entered into a joint development project with poly u a systems  inc for development of several new products to enhance automated urinalysis 
subsequently  certain disputes arose with the poly u a shareholders 
in  we made a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of poly u a stock for a package of iris securities with an estimated value of up to million 
approximately of the outstanding shares of poly u a were tendered in this transaction 
we have recorded the cost of purchasing poly u a stock as a litigation settlement expense 
poly u a is now a majority owned subsidiary of iris  and is accounted for accordingly 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over last year 
sales of ivd imaging systems increased to million from million  an increase of million  or from the last year 
the increase is due primarily to higher sales to both domestic hospitals and international distributors

this growth is due to increased sales of the yellow iris family of workstations and increased sales of related system supplies and services to the growing installed base 
revenues from small laboratory devices segment increased to million in the current period  as compared to million last year  an increase of  if the non recurring royalty fee earned from the prior year is excluded  small laboratory device sales increased  this growth is primarily due to increased sales of instruments and consumables to a larger installed base and one of its distributors 
cost of goods for ivd systems as a percentage of sales of ivd imaging systems totaled in the current period and is comparable to last year 
an increase in proportion of sales of the yellow iris urinalysis workstation to international distributors with associated lower margins and high costs associated with the write off of the white iris inventory were offset by lower costs associated with domestic sales 
cost of goods for ivd imaging system supplies and services as a percentage of sales of such products decreased to for the current period as compared to for the same period last year 
this decrease is due to increased revenues while related expenses decreased 
cost of goods for small instruments and supplies as a percentage of sales of small instruments and supplies totaled for the current year compared to for last year due to a change in the sales mix and increased volume 
the aggregate gross margin totaled for the year ended december   and is comparable to last year s 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues from the urinalysis segment totaled  as compared to last year

net research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in net research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues from to 
reimbursements under joint development programs decreased by  from the prior year 
total product technology expenditures  including capitalized software development costs and reimbursed costs under research and development grants and contracts  decreased to million from million  a decrease of  or as compared to last year 
the decline in total product technology expenditures is due to decreased spending on the yellow iris family of products 
we began a major project in to improve the yellow iris urinalysis workstation product line 
as a result  we expect significant increases in our net research and development expenses above levels 
we have completed feasibility studies on the proposed improvements 
we believe that this project is important to maintaining our competitive position in the urinalysis market and that our failure to successfully complete this project on schedule could have a material and adverse effect on future system sales 
amortization of intangible assets reflects the amortization of deferred expenses for warrants issued in connection with a joint development project  intangible assets arising from an acquisition and patents 
amortization of  intangible assets for the year ended december  decreased to  from  a decrease of  or  from the prior year 
the decline is the result of the write off in the third quarter of of the deferred warrant costs for technology rights

sales of small instruments and supplies decreased to million from million  a decrease of  royalty and licensing revenue decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to differences in non recurring licensing fees received in the two years 
revenues from the urinalysis segment totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the prior year  an increase of  the net increase is due to increased revenues from supplies and service for the yellow iris which more than offset a decline in sales of the yellow iris instruments and a decline in licensing revenues 
revenues from the small laboratory devices segment were essentially comparable as increased licensing revenues were substantially offset by reduced purchases by a major distributor 
cost of goods for ivd systems increased as a percentage of their sales to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to lower average selling prices of the yellow iris urinalysis workstations caused by an increased proportion of international sales

cash provided by operations for the year ended december  increased to million from  for the comparable period last year 
this increase is primarily due to the decrease in inventory levels  improved operations excluding unusual noncash write offs and increased accrued liabilities 
cash used by investing activities totaled  for the year ended december   as compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to the decline in expenditures for property and equipment  offset by the proceeds from the sale of the yellow iris urinalysis workstations previously subject to an operating lease 
the credit facility with foothill capital corporation  a wells fargo company  consists of a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit are limited to a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and are subject to a combined limit of million for the total credit facility 
the term loan bears interest at the lender s prime rate on december  plus  and is payable in equal monthly installments 
the revolving line of credit bears interest at the lender s prime rate plus 
the credit facility is subject to minimum interest charges  prepayment penalties and customary fees  is collateralized by a first priority lien on all the assets of the company and matures in it also contains financial covenants based primarily on tangible net worth and cash flow and imposes restrictions on acquisitions  capital expenditures and cash dividends 
we were not in compliance with one of these financial covenants at year end  and the credit facility has been amended to waive the non compliance and modify the financial covenants for future periods 
we began a major project in to improve the yellow iris urinalysis workstation product line 
as a result  we expect significant increases in our research and development expenditures 
we plan to fund this project with cash from operations 
net cash used by financing activities totaled million and consisted primarily of principal payments made on the term loan described above and notes payable due to corange international limited  an affiliate of the boehringer mannheim group of companies  partially offset by net proceeds from borrowings on the revolving line of credit 
as of december   million was outstanding under the term loan and  was outstanding under the revolving line of credit  million remained available for future borrowings under the revolving credit line 
we reduced our outstanding debt by million in and we have scheduled principal payments totaling million during the next twelve months 
we believe that our current cash on hand  together with cash generated from operations and cash available under the credit facility  will be sufficient to fund normal operations and pay principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for the next months 
on july   our million subordinated note becomes due and payable 
we anticipate that we will have to seek proceeds from a debt or equity financing in order to meet this obligation 
we issued  shares of series b callable preferred stock in connection with the tender offer for poly u a 
see overview 
these shares have a liquidation preference of per share or an aggregate liquidation preference of 
the callable feature entitles us to convert the preferred stock at any time into a number of shares of common stock equal to the liquidation value divided by the market price of the common stock at the time of conversion subject to a minimum value of per share of common stock 
the preferred stock will automatically convert under the same formula on august  if we have not converted it sooner 
based on the average closing price of for the five day period ending december   the call price would be the minimum  and we could convert the series b callable preferred stock into  shares of common stock 
the series b callable preferred stock is non voting  is not entitled to any preferred dividends  and is not subject to any mandatory or optional redemption provisions 
we are not permitted to pay cash dividends on our common stock or to repurchase any shares of our common stock without the written consent of the holders of a majority of the series b callable preferred stock 
discontinued business operations we acquired perceptive scientific instruments in july its principal product line is the powergene family of genetic analyzers ivd imaging systems for karyotyping  dna probe analysis and comparative genomic hybridization 
in march of  we entered into a letter of intent to sell this business to a well known international company for an estimated price of to million in cash 
the exact price depends on the results of the buyer s remaining due diligence and the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the most significant condition is the successful transfer of certain government research contracts to the buyer  and this may require governmental approval 
in light of our plans to sell perceptive scientific instruments  we are treating this business as a discontinued operation for accounting purposes  and we have removed it from most of the discussion and financial information and in this annual report to reflect this treatment 
however  the letter of intent is not a binding agreement  and we cannot be sure that this transaction will occur 
closing this transaction depends upon the outcome of the buyer s remaining due diligence  the satisfaction of various conditions set by the buyer  negotiating and signing a definitive written sale agreement and board of director approval from both companies 
if this sale does not occur  we plan to pursue other opportunities for a disposition of this business 
shareholder rights plan we adopted a shareholders rights plan in december the rights are not presently exercisable 
they become exercisable only if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock  or announces a tender offer for or more of our common stock  without board approval 
if the rights are triggered  all common stockholders except the hostile party will be entitled to purchase shares of common stock or the economic equivalent in preferred stock at a price based on a substantial discount from the market price of the common stock 
the board of directors may terminate the plan at any time or redeem the rights prior to their becoming exercisable 
the rights expire on december  net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
if substantially all of our outstanding options and warrants  including the warrants issued in the poly ua transaction  are exercised on or before december   these transactions in combination with other prior stock issuances during the past three years would constitute a change of ownership under section of the internal revenue code 
section imposes an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards based on a statutory rate of return usually the applicable federal rate and the value of the corporation at the time of the change of ownership 
depending on the market price of our common stock at the time a change of ownership occurs  the resulting limitations imposed by section could trigger a substantial write down in our deferred tax assets and a corresponding charge to earnings in the relevant quarter 
year problem the year  or yk  problem arose because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to recognize a year 
this issue has not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
market risk our business is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rates we rely significantly on long and short term fixed and variable rate debt in our capital structure 
we do not use interest rate swaps to manage any of our floating rate debt obligations 
as of december   our debt obligations consisted of million outstanding under an fixed rate subordinated note  million outstanding under a variable rate term loan and  outstanding under a variable rate revolving line of credit 
the variable rate obligations are based upon the lender s prime rate 
see liquidity and capital resources 
assuming an increase of one half of a percentage point in the lender s prime rate on january  and no principal payments for the remainder of the year  our total interest expense would increase by less than  for as compared to foreign currencies we are subject to some currency risk on a portion of our licensing revenues 
this portion is calculated quarterly based on sales results in japanese yen and subsequently converted into united states dollars at the then current exchange rate 
inflation we do not foresee any material impact on our operations from inflation 
healthcare reform policies in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the healthcare system  nationally  at the state level or both 
future legislation  regulation or payment policies of medicare  medicaid  private health insurance plans  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors could adversely affect the demand for our current or future products and our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
moreover  healthcare legislation is an area of extensive and dynamic change  and we cannot predict future legislative changes in the healthcare field or their impact on our business 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements which reflect our current views about future events and financial results 
we have made these statements in reliance on the safe harbor created by that private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include our views on future financial results  financing sources  product development  capital requirements  market growth and the like  and are generally identified by phrases such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  plans and similar words 
forward looking statements are merely predictions and therefore inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors which could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statement 
these uncertainties and other factors include  among other things  our ability to secure additional financing to repay the remaining principal balance of our long term debt and to fund our long term business strategy  unexpected technical and marketing difficulties inherent in major product development efforts such as the new platform for the yellow iris  the potential need for changes in our long term strategy in response to future developments  future advances in diagnostic testing methods and procedures  as well as potential changes in government regulations and healthcare policies  both of which could adversely affect the economics of the diagnostic testing procedures automated by our products  rapid technological change in the microelectronics and software industries  and increasing competition from imaging and non imaging based in vitro diagnostic products 
we have attempted to identify additional significant uncertainties and other factors affecting forward looking statements in exhibit to this annual report 
stockholders should understand that the uncertainties and other factors identified in this annual report and in exhibit are not a comprehensive list of all the uncertainties and other factors which may affect forward looking statements 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements or the list of uncertainties and other factors which could affect those statements 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides the sec s views on applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company is presently evaluating the impact  if any  that this may have on the company s revenue recognition policies
