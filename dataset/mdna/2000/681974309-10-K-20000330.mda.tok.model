in march  the aicpa issued sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  software revenue recognition  which amends certain provisions of sop the company believes it is in compliance with the provisions of sop as amended by sop in december  the aicpa issued sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  which amends certain provisions of sop and extends the deferral of the application of certain passages of sop provided by sop until the beginning of the company s fiscal year the company does not expect the adoption of sop will have a material effect on its financial position or operating results 
year impact many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
the company has not experienced any problems with its computer systems relating to distinguishing twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates  which generally are referred to as year problems 
the company is also not aware of any material year problems with its clients or vendors 
accordingly  the company does not anticipate incurring material expenses or experiencing any material operational disruptions as a result of any year problems 
certain factors affecting future operating results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results 
product concentration 
to date  substantially all of the company s revenues have been attributable to sales of licenses of the company s facsimile based enterprise solutions and related products and services 
the company expects such products and related services to continue to account for a substantial majority of the company s future revenues 
in march  the company changed its strategic focus to the development of secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions 
to date  the company has not introduced any secure business to business electronic document exchange products to the market 
the company expects that its planned secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions will account for an increasing portion of future revenues 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to implement the secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions  or if implemented  such solutions will be financially successful or result in any revenues 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for such products  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies dependent upon operating revenues from a new product line in an emerging and rapidly evolving market 
new products and technological change 
the markets for the company s products and planned products are relatively new and are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and respond to evolving end user requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product enhancements on a timely basis  or that new products or product enhancements developed by the company will achieve market acceptance 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s existing products and products currently under development obsolete and unmarketable 
from time to time  the company and its competitors may announce new products  capabilities or technologies that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of the company s existing product offerings 
there can be no assurance that announcements of currently planned or other new product offerings by the company or its competitors will not cause customers to defer or forego the licensing of the company s existing or planned products and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on fax sr 
nt and the windows nt environment 
the company currently derives a substantial portion of its revenues from licenses of fax sr 
nt and related services and resale of related hardware 
continued market acceptance of fax sr 
nt is critical to the company s future success 
as a result  any decline in demand for or failure to maintain broad market acceptance of fax sr 
nt as a result of competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future financial performance will depend in large part on customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of fax sr 
nt 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in marketing fax sr 
nt or any new or enhanced versions of fax sr 
nt 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the windows nt operating system will not be replaced by a new or enhanced operating system 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing products for new or enhanced operating systems such as windows  or that such systems will not obviate the need for the company s products 
if any new or enhanced operating system gains widespread use and the company fails to develop and provide its products for this operating system on a timely basis  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on client server environment 
the company s enterprise  client server facsimile software products are intended to help organizations efficiently manage their facsimile communications  utilizing a client server computing environment 
the client server market is relatively new and there can be no assurance that organizations will move away from the use of stand alone fax machines or continue to adopt client server environments  or that customers of the company that have begun the migration to a client server environment will broadly implement this model of computing 
the company s future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the market for client server applications  which in turn will depend in part on the growth in the number of organizations implementing client server computing environments 
there can be no assurance that these markets will continue to grow or that the company will be able to respond effectively to the evolving requirements of these markets 
if the market for client server application products and services does not grow in the future  or grows more slowly than the company anticipates  or if the company fails to respond effectively to evolving requirements of this market  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
the market risks for secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions 
the market for the company s secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions are new and evolving rapidly 
the company s success will depend upon the adoption and use by current and potential customers of secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions 
the company s success will also depend upon acceptance of its technology as the standard for providing these solutions 
the adoption and use of the company s secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions will involve changes in the manner in which businesses have traditionally exchanged information 
the company s ability to influence usage of its secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions by customers is limited 
the company intends to spend considerable resources educating potential customers about the value of secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions 
it is difficult to assess  or to predict with any assurance  the present and future size of the potential market for the company s secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions  or its growth rate  if any 
moreover  the company cannot predict whether the company s secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions will achieve any market acceptance 
any future products or future product enhancements that are not favorably received by customers may not be profitable and  furthermore  could damage the company s reputation or brand name 
intense competition 
the enterprise  client server facsimile solution and secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions markets are intensely competitive and rapidly changing and the company expects competition to continue to increase 
the company believes its ability to compete successfully depends upon a number of factors both within and beyond its control  including product performance  reliability and features  including internet related capabilities  product adoption  ease of use  product scaleability  quality of support services  price performance  timeliness of enhancements and new product releases by the company and its competitors  the emergence of new computer based facsimile and secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions and standards  name recognition  the establishment of strategic alliances with industry leaders  and industry and general economic trends 
the company competes directly with a large number of vendors of facsimile products  including providers of facsimile software products for client server networks such as rightfax inc a subsidiary of applied voice technology  inc  fenestrae bv  optus software inc  topcall international and biscom  inc the company also competes with vendors offering a range of alternative facsimile solutions including operating systems containing facsimile and document transmission features  low end fax modem products  desktop fax software  single platform facsimile software products  and customized proprietary software solutions 
in addition  providers of operating systems or business software applications may bundle competitive facsimile solutions as part of their broader product offerings 
the company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors in the secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions market  and the competitive pressures the company faces could harm its business and prospects 
the company intends to provide an alternative to traditional mail and courier document delivery services  such as those offered by federal express corporation  united parcel service or the us postal service 
the company s solution is also an alternative to general purpose e mail applications and services 
in the more narrow area of secure online document exchange  the company s competition comes from secure online document exchange services providers 
some of these providers have products that are intended to compete with the company s products 
examples of these companies include differential  e parcel  netdox  postx and tumbleweed 
in addition  many companies with which the company does not presently compete may become competitors in the future 
this could occur either through the expansion of the company s products or through other companies product development in the area of secure online communication 
these companies could include critical path  documentum  hummingbird  international business machines lotus development  microsoft and verisign 
many of the company s competitors and potential competitiors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and market acceptance of their products and technologies than the company 
in addition  there are relatively low barriers to entry in the markets in which the company operates and intends to operate  and new competition may arise either from expansion by established companies or from new emerging companies or from resellers of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that current or potential competitors of the company will not develop products comparable or superior in terms of price and performance features to those developed by the company  adapt more quickly than the company to new or emerging technologies and changes in market opportunities or customer requirements  establish alliances with industry leaders  or take advantage of acquisition opportunities more readily than the company 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the company will not be required to make substantial additional investments in connection with its research  development  engineering  marketing  sales and customer service efforts in order to meet any competitive threat  or that such required investments will not have a material adverse effect on operating margins 
increased competition will result in reduction in market share  pressure for price reductions and related reductions in gross margins  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s ability to achieve its financial and business goals 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors 
risks associated with acquisitions 
the company may augment its internal growth with acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that could complement or expand the company s business 
certain of these businesses may be marginally profitable or unprofitable 
in order to achieve anticipated benefits from these acquisitions  the company must successfully integrate the acquired businesses with its existing operations  and no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in this regard 
the company has limited experience in intergrating acquired companies into its operations  in expanding the scope of operations of required businesses  in managing geographically dispersed operations  and in operating internationally 
in the past the company has incurred one time costs and expenses in connection with acquisitions and it is likely that similar one time costs and expenses may be incurred in connection with future acquisitions 
in addition  attractive acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including competition among prospective buyers and the possible need to obtain regulatory approval 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete future acquisitions 
in order to finance such acquisitions  it may be necessary for the company to raise additional funds either through public or private financings  including bank borrowings 
any financing  if available at all  may be on terms which are not favorable to the company 
the company may also issue shares of its common stock to acquire such businesses  which may result in dilution to the company s existing stockholders 
limited operating history 
the company was incorporated in march and shipped its initial facsimile software products in the company has significantly increased its operating expenses in recent periods as it has continued to expand its organization to support sales growth and product development 
although the company has experienced growth during the past  the company does not believe that prior growth rates are sustainable or indicative of future operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its level of revenues or maintain profitability in the future 
increases in operating expenses  primarily research and development spending  are expected to continue and  together with pricing pressures  may result in a decrease in operating income and operating margin percentage 
the company s limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
future operating results will depend on many factors  including  without limitation  the degree and rate of growth of the markets in which the company competes and the accompanying demand for the company s products  the level of acceptance of the windows nt and windows operating systems  the level of acceptance for secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions  the level of product and price competition  the ability of the company to establish strategic relationships and develop and market new and enhanced products and to control costs  the ability of the company to expand its direct telesales force and indirect distribution channels both domestically and internationally  and the ability of the company to attract and retain key personnel 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations  seasonality 
the company s quarterly revenues and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely fluctuate significantly in the future 
causes of such fluctuations have included and may include  among others  the demand for the company s products and services  the size and timing of orders  the number  timing and significance of new product announcements by the company and its competitors  the ability of the company to develop  introduce  market and ship new and enhanced versions of the company s current and planned products on a timely basis  the level of product and price competition  changes in operating expenses  changes in average selling prices and mix of the company s products  changes in the company s sales incentive strategy  the mix of direct and indirect sales  and general economic factors 
in addition  the sale of the company s products often involves delays because customers have tended to implement the products on a large scale and customers also must establish certain minimum hardware capabilities 
the company s products therefore often have a lengthy sales cycle while the customer evaluates and receives approvals for the purchase of the company s products 
during such sales cycles  the company may expend substantial funds and management effort yet receive no revenues 
it may be difficult to accurately predict the sales cycle of any large order 
if one or more large orders fails to close as forecasted in a fiscal quarter  the company s revenues and operating results for such quarter could be materially adversely affected 
any one or more of these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the potential occurrence of any one or more of these factors makes the prediction of revenues and results of operations on a quarterly basis difficult and performance forecasts derived from such predictions unreliable 
the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality 
the company has historically had and expects to continue to have weaker sales in the months of july and august which may have an adverse affect on third quarter sales 
the company believes that these fluctuations are caused primarily by customer budgeting and purchasing patterns 
in general  revenues are difficult to forecast because the market for enterprise  client server facsimile and secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions software has developed and is evolving rapidly and the company s sales cycle  from the customer s initial evaluation through purchase of licenses and the related support services  varies substantially from customer to customer 
license fee revenues in any quarter depend on orders received and shipped in that quarter with an increasing percentage of orders in any quarter being received in the last weeks of the quarter 
license fee revenues from quarter to quarter are difficult to forecast  as no significant order backlog exists at the end of any quarter because the company s products typically are shipped upon receipt of customers orders 
a substantial portion of the company s operating expense is related to personnel  facilities  equipment and marketing programs 
the level of spending for such expense cannot be adjusted quickly and is therefore fixed in the short term 
the company s expense levels for personnel  facilities  equipment and marketing programs are based  in significant part  on the company s expectations of future revenues on a quarterly basis 
if actual revenue levels on a quarterly basis are below management s expectations  results of operations are likely to be adversely affected by a similar amount because a relatively small amount of the company s expense varies with its revenue in the short term 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future periods the company s results of operations will be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
ability to manage growth 
the company has rapidly and significantly expanded its operations and anticipates that significant expansion will continue to be required in order to address potential market opportunities 
the company anticipates that it will continue to significantly increase the size of its sales and marketing  research and development  customer support and administrative operations 
there can be no assurance that such expansion will be successfully completed or that it will generate sufficient revenues to cover the company s expenses 
the company will need to continue to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain or continue to hire such personnel in the future 
the inability of the company to effectively expand operations and manage growth  if any  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
expansion of indirect channels  potential for channel conflict 
the company markets its products and services directly through telesales and indirectly through marketing channels such as value added resellers vars  systems integrators and distributors 
although the company has historically focused its efforts on marketing through its telesales force  the company is increasing resources dedicated to developing and expanding indirect marketing channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified vars  systems integrators and distributors to market successfully the company s products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s resellers will not develop  acquire or market computer based facsimile products competitive with the company s products 
the failure to retain its vars  systems integrators and distributors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the distributor agreements generally provide that either party may terminate the agreement without cause upon days written notice to the other party 
the company also resells its products on a purchase order basis through other vars  systems integrators and distributors 
such relationships may be terminated by either party  at any time  and therefore  there can be no assurance that any var  systems integrator or distributor will continue to represent the company s products 
the inability to retain certain vars  systems integrators or distributors  or the development or marketing by vars  systems integrators or distributors of competitive offerings  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
selling through indirect channels may limit the company s contacts with its customers 
as a result  the company s ability to accurately forecast sales  evaluate customer satisfaction and recognize emerging customer requirements may be hindered 
the company s strategy of marketing its products directly to end users and indirectly through vars  systems integrators and distributors may result in distribution channel conflicts 
the company s direct sales efforts may compete with those of its indirect channels and  to the extent different resellers target the same customers  resellers may also come into conflict with each other 
as the company strives to expand its indirect distribution channels  there can be no assurance that emerging channel conflicts will not materially adversely affect its relationships with existing vars  systems integrators or distributors or adversely affect its ability to attract new vars  systems integrators and distributors 
risks associated with international expansion 
a key element of the company s strategy is to continue to increase its international sales 
the company expects to face competition from local facsimile product and secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions providers in their native countries 
to successfully expand international sales  the company will need to recruit and retain additional international resellers and distributors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international sales of its products or that the company s international distribution channels will be able to adequately market  service and support the company s products 
international operations generally are subject to certain risks  including dependence on independent resellers  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements  variability of foreign economic conditions and changing restrictions imposed by united states export laws 
additional risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs of localizing products for foreign countries  lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
with the acquisition of cma ettworth  based in london  england  in december  the company obtained its first sales offices outside of the united states 
such operations are subject to certain additional risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing such operations and potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  a majority of the company s sales have been made in united states dollars and the company has not engaged in any hedging transactions through the purchase of derivative securities or otherwise 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future performance depends  in significant part  upon the continued service of its key technical  sales and senior management personnel  none of whom is bound by an employment agreement and only certain of whom are bound by noncompetition agreements 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and the company has experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified technical personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain or continue to hire key technical  sales and managerial personnel in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments as of december   the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
all of the company s investments consist of money market funds and municipal bonds that are carried on the company s books at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio of cash equivalent and short term investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
the company s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of its united kingdom subsidiary are almost exclusively conducted in its local currency 
the united kingdom subsidiary operating results are translated into us dollars and consolidated for reporting purposes 
the impact of currency exchange rate movements on intercompany transactions was immaterial for the year ended december  currently the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
