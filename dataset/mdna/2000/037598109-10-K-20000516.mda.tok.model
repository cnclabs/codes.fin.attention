item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in fiscal  apogee experienced slower than expected production ramp ups in glass technologies  and weak conditions in our auto glass operations 
this offset record results in the company s tru vue  architectural products wausau windows wall systems and linetec and harmon  inc businesses 
during fiscal  the company brought on line significant new capacity in glass technologies with the start up of viracon s statesboro  georgia facility  tru vue s new facility and the addition of viratec s new vertical coater 
performance fiscal compared to fiscal the following table illustrates the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for each of the fiscal years in the three year period ended february  fiscal results are restated to reflect the effect of discontinued operations reported for fiscal fiscal was not impacted by these discontinued operations reported in fiscal percent of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest and other expense  net earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and other items income taxes equity in net loss of affiliated companies earnings from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations net earnings loss consolidated net sales increased to million in fiscal the glass services gs segment reported a net sales gain of  while the glass technologies gt segment reported a net sales gain of 
net sales of gs s replacement auto glass businesses were flat with those of a year ago although unit volume increased slightly  while net sales of its building glass services unit grew by 
gt s net sales increase is due to capacity increases at viracon  inc viracon  viratec thin films viratec and to a lesser extent at tru vue 
on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  rose to  up from in fiscal the primary factors underlying the resulting decline in gross profit were slower than anticipated production ramp ups at viracon and viratec  along with increased costs to increase production velocity at viracon and a decline in margin in the replacement auto glass businesses 
these factors were partially offset by margin improvements at gs s harmon  inc and to a lesser extent at gt s architectural products units 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses grew by million  or 
the primary factors for the growth were an increase in salaries  bad debts  marketing costs  outside services  information systems and severance costs  offset by a decrease in bonuses and incentives 
a portion of the increased personnel costs represented classification variances associated with the company s many system conversions  quantification of such classifications is not considered cost effective 
gross profit benefited as a result of these classification variances 
net interest expense rose to million in fiscal the increase reflected higher weighted average outstanding borrowing levels and to a lesser extent  slightly higher interest rates under the company s revolving credit agreement 
the company expects slightly lower interest expense for fiscal as decreases in debt are expected to be offset by slightly higher rates 
apogee s effective income tax rate was of pre tax earnings from continuing operations  down marginally from the rate recorded in fiscal apogee s equity in the net loss of affiliated companies was million in fiscal compared to million a year ago  largely associated with the company s terrasun research and development venture 
apogee s fiscal earnings from continuing operations declined to million  or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
earnings from operations of discontinued businesses was million after tax  or diluted earnings per share  compared to million  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
apogee s fiscal net earnings were million  or diluted earnings per share

dollar amounts in thousands glass technologies net sales    operating income    glass services net sales    operating income    glass technologies gt gt reported a net sales improvement of in fiscal  reflecting growth at each business unit within the segment 
operating earnings decreased due to low operating rates and additional costs incurred to improve production rates at viracon and viratec 
the segment s results were also negatively affected by the start up of viracon s statesboro  georgia plant and the slower than anticipated ramp up of viratec s vertical coater  as well as a technology change over related to a new product in its crt coating operation 
viracon  the segment s largest operating unit  reported a net sales increase of  while operating earnings decreased significantly compared to last year 
the decrease in profitability was the result of a decrease in earnings at the owatonna  minnesota plant and start up losses and slower than expected ramp up at its new statesboro  georgia facility 
operating earnings at the owatonna plant were down compared to last year due to reduced operating rates and additional costs incurred to position the facility for improved production velocity 
the start up of the statesboro plant is complete  however the ramp up proceeded at a slower pace than expected resulting in an operating loss 
viratec  which applies optical grade coatings to glass and other substrates  reported a net sales increase of  while recording an operating loss 
the operating loss is primarily due to viratec s flat glass operation which encountered significant downtime with the start up of its new vertical coater 
the vertical coater became operational in the third quarter 
also  in mid year  viratec s san diego crt coating operation lost significant production time during a technology changeover to accommodate a new product 
the san diego operation has returned to its previous technology and is fully operational 
tru vue  the segment s value added art frame glass and matboard fabrication unit  posted a improvement in sales  while earnings rose by 
these results reflect increased penetration of the unit s value added products and increased capacity and efficiency due to the mid year completion of a new production facility 
during the second quarter of fiscal  tru vue moved into its new facility in the chicago area 
architectural products  which manufactures commercial windows and provides painting and anodizing services  leveraged higher net sales into a operating income gain 
architectural products continued to benefit from improvements in its engineering and fabrication capabilities at both its wausau window and wall systems and linetec businesses 
based on its year end backlog  continued evidence of strong demand for architectural glass products  the full year operation of viratec s flat glass operation and viracon s statesboro plant  gt expects to report higher net sales and operating earnings in fiscal the company expects increasing profitability to build in the second half of the year as the company moves further above the breakeven points for production in new operations 
glass services gs operates auto glass businesses under the harmon autoglass harmon  harmon solutions group solutions  glass depot and viracon curvlite names 
due to an industry merger in  gs became the second largest company in the auto glass repair and replacement industry 
in addition  gs includes harmon  inc  a provider of building glass installation and replacement services in several major metropolitan areas 
gs reported a net sales improvement in fiscal  while operating earnings decreased significantly 
net sales of the auto glass retail unit decreased slightly compared with those of a year ago  although unit volume was flat 
a significant operating loss was recorded due to increased competitive pricing pressures in the retail business and soft retail demand 
market data indicates that unit demand for replacement auto glass in the us fell nominally in same location retail net sales decreased by  while unit net sales were flat with last year 
to respond to changing market conditions  the business was restructured during fiscal to reduce fixed cost overhead 
in fiscal  retail auto facilities were closed  with a total of approximately closings expected in fiscal in addition  employee headcount was reduced at auto glass headquarters and to a lesser extent in the field workforce 
also  retail coverage in closed store markets is being maintained by mobile vans and service centers operated from facilities shared with businesses outside of the company 
unit sales trends for the auto glass retail unit continued to outpace the industry 
the segment s manufacturing operation  viracon curvlite  fabricates auto glass for the replacement auto glass aftermarket 
viracon curvlite s net sales in fiscal decreased slightly 
the unit s national distribution center  which offers other manufacturers products as well as our own for both domestic and foreign vehicles  and the autoglass express program  a delivery system to fill customer orders more quickly and completely  accounted for an increase in unit sales 
this increase was offset by a decrease in unit sales for the broker program  resulting in a slight decrease in unit sales for fiscal  compared to last year 
about of viracon curvlite s net sales were made to the glass depot unit in fiscal the harmon  inc business had another solid year 
net sales grew by  while operating income rose by 
continuing operating improvements and an emphasis towards higher margin business helped the unit s profitability 
at fiscal year end  gs had harmon autoglass retail locations  co branded facilities  glass depot distribution centers and harmon  inc operated in geographic markets 
the segment continues to explore opportunities to expand the reach of its businesses 
auto glass industry conditions continue to be weak  particularly in pricing at the distribution and retail channels 
the segment expects to report higher net sales in fiscal with unit growth from market penetration in both the auto glass business and harmon  inc meanwhile  the segment continues to take actions to reduce its cost structure and improve productivity  particularly in its retail operations 
however  the unpredictability of the auto glass industry unit sales and pricing makes it difficult to project operating earnings for fiscal discontinued operations in late fiscal  apogee s board of directors authorized the exit from the company s interest in vis n service corporation vis n  a non auto glass focused  third party administered claims processor 
on may   the company completed the sale of of the stock of its large scale domestic curtainwall business  harmon  ltd 
in fiscal  apogee s board of directors authorized the divestiture of the detention security and domestic curtainwall operations 
on december   the segment executed the sale of its detention security business  effective november  combined with the fiscal exit from international curtainwall operations  these transactions effectively remove the company from the large scale construction business  in addition to the non auto glass focused third party administered claims processing business 
accordingly  these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
operating results from the businesses reported as discontinued operations improved significantly over those recorded a year ago 
for fiscal  earnings from discontinued operations were million after tax compared to in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal the following discussion restates the prior year s discussion of fiscal compared with to reflect the effect of reporting certain businesses as discontinued operations in fiscal consolidated net sales increased to million in fiscal the glass services gs segment reported a net sales gain of  while the glass technologies gt segment s net sales were essentially unchanged with those of fiscal net sales of gs s replacement auto glass businesses increased  while net sales of its building glass services unit grew by more than one third 
the replacement auto glass operations increased net sales by combining retail same store net sales growth with the addition of retail and wholesale locations 
gt net sales were flat primarily due to the effects of capacity limitations and the relocation of a product line 
on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  rose slightly to  up from in fiscal the primary factors underlying the resulting decline in gross profit were the effect of the planned suspension and relocation of a gt product line  temporary productivity issues related to capacity limitations at viracon and a small decline in margin in the replacement auto glass businesses 
these factors were partly offset by margin improvements at gs s harmon  inc and gt s architectural products units 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses grew by million  or  but declined slightly as a percent of net sales 
the primary factors for the growth were higher salaries  outside services and charitable contributions  as well as increased information systems and marketing costs  particularly at our gs segment 
net interest expense rose to million in fiscal the increase reflected higher interest rates and borrowing levels under our revolving credit agreement 
apogee s effective income tax rate was of pre tax earnings from continuing operations  down marginally from the rate recorded in fiscal apogee s equity in the net loss of affiliated companies was million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal apogee s fiscal earnings from continuing operations declined to million  or diluted earnings per share

see also note business segment data in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a three year history of each segment s net sales  operating income  identifiable assets  capital expenditures  and depreciation and amortization 
glass technologies gt after five consecutive years of record results  gt reported net sales in fiscal level with million of net sales in fiscal  while operating income fell to million 
the segment s results were primarily affected by the suspension and relocation of viratec s optium tm cathode ray tube crt coating line  and the start up costs and disruptions associated with the segment s other capital projects 
the segment s results were also affected by significantly lower demand for viratec s anti glare filter and front surface mirror products due to the economic slowdown in asia and temporary issues related to capacity limitations at viracon that slowed production and caused additional costs during the second quarter 
viracon s net sales were slightly lower in fiscal than the prior year 
the architectural glass fabrication unit s operating earnings fell  reflecting the second quarter operational difficulties noted above and start up costs associated with the construction of a new facility 
viracon ran near full capacity for much of the year  even as expanded production capacity was added 
viracon s production outpaced its shipments by a considerable margin during fiscal  which also adversely affected operating earnings and resulted in increased finished goods inventory 
during fiscal  viracon began and largely completed construction of a new architectural glass fabrication complex in statesboro  georgia 
the statesboro facility began production in march together with capacity improvements at the unit s minnesota facility  viracon s capacity over the next two fiscal years will increase by over 
viratec reported a net sales decline 
viratec recorded an operating loss in fiscal compared to solid operating earnings in fiscal as noted  the unit was adversely affected by the suspension of the optium crt coating line and significantly lower demand for its anti glare filter and front surface mirror products due to the economic slowdown in asia 
the crt coating line was suspended in connection with its relocation from minnesota to southern california  a location closer to the flow of customers computer monitor supply chains 
the optium line resumed production in september and began ramping up production levels to meet sales orders commitments received from customers 
viratec also continued to proceed with the addition of a new large scale flat glass coating line in its minnesota facility 
in fiscal  tru vue  the segment s value added art frame glass and matboard fabrication unit  posted a improvement in sales  while earnings rose by 
these results reflected increased penetration of the unit s value added products and success in the control of production costs 
during the first quarter of fiscal  tru vue broke ground for a new facility in the chicago area 
the new facility was completed in the spring of and will allow greater production capacity and efficiency 
architectural products  which manufactures commercial windows and provides painting and anodizing services  leveraged marginally higher net sales into a operating income gain 
architectural products continued to benefit from improvements in its engineering and fabrication capabilities 
glass services gs operates auto glass businesses under the harmon autoglass harmon  harmon solutions group solutions  glass depot and viracon curvlite names 
in addition  gs includes harmon  inc  a provider of building glass installation and replacement services in several major metropolitan areas 
gs reported a net sales improvement in fiscal  while operating earnings rose by 
net sales of the retail unit increased during fiscal  reflecting increased market share and manufactured windshield sales  and the addition of retail and distribution locations 
operating income for the auto glass businesses increased 
sales growth continued to outpace the industry 
market data indicates that unit demand for replacement auto glass in the us fell nominally in same location retail net sales rose by during fiscal  while unit net sales increased 
during fiscal  harmon increased sales to insurance companies through harmon solutions group 
the segment also continued to proceed with efforts to improve productivity for its auto glass repair and replacement operations 
the segment s manufacturing operation  viracon curvlite  fabricates auto glass for the replacement auto glass aftermarket 
viracon curvlite increased net sales in fiscal by about 
the unit s national distribution center  which offers other manufacturers products as well as its own for both domestic and foreign vehicles  and the autoglass express program  a delivery system to fill customer orders more quickly and completely  accounted for much of the unit s net sales growth 
about of viracon curvlite s net sales were made to the glass depot unit in fiscal on may   the segment acquired an interest in vis n service corporation vis n  an insurance claims and policy processing outsource company headquartered in red wing  minnesota 
this acquisition expanded the segment s capabilities to outsource insurance claims and policy processing beyond its traditional auto glass market 
during the year  the segment sold its eight midas muffler franchises to better focus on its auto glass operations 
the harmon  inc business had another solid year in fiscal net sales grew by more than  while operating income rose by more than 
continuing operating improvements and a shift in net sales mix towards higher margin business helped the unit s profitability 
during fiscal  gs completed several small acquisitions of retail glass shops 
these acquisitions  combined with other locations added during the year  increased the number of locations to harmon retail stores  co branded facilities and glass depot distribution centers at fiscal year end 
discontinued operations operating results from the businesses reported as discontinued operations improved dramatically in fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  earnings from discontinued operations amounted to million after tax compared to an after tax net loss from discontinued operations of million in fiscal the exit from european curtainwall operations remained on track  and the asian curtainwall unit had essentially completed the remaining projects in its backlog 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition net cash provided by financing activities in may  the company obtained a five year  committed credit facility in the amount of million 
this credit facility requires apogee to maintain minimum levels of net worth and certain financial ratios  and was initially secured by the company s receivables  inventory  equipment and intangibles 
the total commitment of the credit facility was reduced by the sales price  net of taxes  of the fiscal sale of the detention security business  resulting in a committed credit facility of million as of february  long term debt  including current installments of million  stood at million at february   down million from a year earlier 
the majority of all of the company s long term debt consisted of bank borrowings 
during fiscal  million of variable rate industrial revenue bonds were issued and the resulting proceeds were loaned to the company to finance a portion of the company s capital projects in statesboro  georgia and san diego  california 
in december  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which expires in fiscal  which effectively converted million of its variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation 
in february  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which expires in fiscal  which effectively converted million of its variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation 
also in february  the company entered into a million sale leaseback associated with miscellaneous operating equipment 
the transaction substantially reduced the company s long term floating rate debt and replaced it with an eight year  fixed rate operating lease 
for fiscal  the company expects that outstanding borrowings will generally decline over the course of the year 
the company believes that cash from operating activities and the available credit facility provide adequate liquidity for the next twelve months 
net cash provided by operating activities cash provided by continuing operating activities in fiscal decreased to million  down from million in fiscal the decrease is due primarily to the fiscal receipt of refundable income taxes from the company s fiscal loss  an increase in receivables primarily driven by an increase in fourth quarter sales  offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities new capital investment in fiscal totaled million  versus million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
additions to property  plant and equipment totaled million 
major expenditures included the completion of the statesboro and tru vue facilities and the addition of viratec s new vertical coater 
also  as noted above  the company entered into a sale leaseback transaction resulting in proceeds from the sale of equipment of million 
the company has capitalized approximately million associated with a portion of an enterprise resource planning erp project at viracon  some of which was in service and amortized in fiscal an evaluation of this portion of the project will be performed in late fiscal to determine future viability of this investment 
in fiscal  the company expects to incur capital expenditures as necessary to maintain existing facilities and information systems 
fiscal expenditures are expected to be less than fiscal shareholders equity at february   apogee s shareholders equity stood at million  up from a year ago 
book value per share also rose to  up from per share a year ago  as outstanding common shares increased only nominally during the year 
net earnings and the proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock under our stock based compensation plans accounted for the increases  which were partly offset by dividends paid and the repurchase of  shares of common stock 
market risks the company s principal market risk is sensitivity to interest rates  which is the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce net earnings of the company 
to manage the company s direct risk from changes in market interest rates  management actively monitors the interest sensitive components of the company s balance sheet  primarily debt obligations  as well as market interest rates in order to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on net earnings and cash flow 
the primary measure of interest rate risk is the simulation of net income under different interest rate environments 
the approach used to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis 
this approach calculates the impact on net earnings  relative to a base case scenario  of rates increasing or decreasing gradually over the next months by basis points 
the aforementioned changes in interest rates affecting the company s financial instruments would result in approximately a million impact to net earnings 
as interest rates increase  net earnings decrease  as interest rates decrease  net earnings increase 
the company uses interest swaps to fix a portion of its variable rate borrowings from fluctuations in interest rates 
as of february   the company has interest swaps covering million of variable rate debt 
the company also routinely uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its net exposures  by currency  related to the foreign currency donominated monetary assets and liabilities  and future firm commitments of its operations 
forward exchange contracts are also used from time to time to manage near term foreign currency cash requirements 
the primary objective of these hedging activities is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes  net of related tax effects  are minimized 
given the company s balanced foreign exchange position described above  a adverse change in foreign exchange rates upon which these contracts are based would result in exchange losses from these contracts that would  in all material respects  be fully offset by exchange gains on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
as of february   the company did not have any forward contracts outstanding as the company had no material foreign exchange exposure 
impact of inflation our financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
however  since the cost of many of our inventories is determined using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting  cost of sales  except for depreciation expense included therein  generally reflects current costs 
the cost of glass  one of our primary raw materials  was essentially flat compared with last year 
we expect the cost of glass to increase slightly in fiscal while our construction and supply contracts are at fixed prices  the material components are usually based on firm quotes obtained from suppliers 
labor costs  including taxes and fringe benefits  rose moderately in fiscal and a moderate increase also can be reasonably anticipated for fiscal other costs are managed to minimize the inflationary pressures that exist in markets for goods and services that apogee s business operations require 
impact of year each of the company s businesses had project teams in place to evaluate its information technology it systems  non it systems  and third party readiness for compliance with year requirements 
for these purposes  the company defines its it systems as those hardware and software systems which comprise its central management information systems and its telephone systems 
all other systems  including those involved in local  on site product design or manufacturing  are considered non it systems 
third parties include the company s key suppliers and customers 
across the company  remediation activities were completed prior to the year rollover 
each business organized planning  testing and support teams to monitor systems  equipment and facilities before  during and after new year s weekend 
as of april  no material issues have surfaced in any business operations  systems or third party relationships 
the company does not expect further year issues to arise 
virtually none of the company s products are date sensitive 
the company s total cost of addressing year issues was estimated to be between and million including external and internal expenditures 
the it related portion of the total year costs was estimated to be of total year expenditures
