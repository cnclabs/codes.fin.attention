results of operations revenues 
for the years ended december   and  we operated primarily in the following reportable segments systems and technology services  business process management  and management consulting services 
systems and technology services encompasses systems development  systems integration and systems management 
also included in this area are desktop services  year conversions and enterprise software solutions 
business process management focuses on the use of technology to manage various business processes within the client s enterprise  including such activities as remittance processing  procurement logistics  customer relationship management  customer service and training  as well as it operations 
management consulting services are provided by at kearney  an eds subsidiary 
services in this area provide clients with high value added strategy  operations and it capabilities combined with implementation skills that improve overall business performance and competitive positioning 
in  we announced the reorganization of our business  effective january   into four business lines information solutions  our it outsourcing business  business process management  our business process management business  e 
solutions  our electronic business unit  and at kearney  our high value added management consulting subsidiary 
the following table displays the percentage of revenues by various categories for the years ended december   and percentage of revenues reportable segments systems and technology services business process management management consulting services all other total gm non gm non gm clients gm and affiliates total geographies united states united kingdom all other  none greater than total total revenues increased in to billion  up from billion in  which represented an increase over total revenues of billion 
on may   delphi automotive systems corporation  previously a wholly owned subsidiary of gm  was spun off from gm 
for comparative purposes in this discussion  revenues from contracts with delphi in both the current and prior periods have been classified as revenues from non gm clients 
revenues from non gm clients grew in to billion  compared with a increase to billion in  up from billion in approximately one half of the increase in revenues from non gm clients in was attributable to systemhouse  which was acquired in april  while the other half of the increase resulted from new contract signings 
these increases in revenues from non gm clients were partially offset by decreases resulting from the divestiture of certain business units and the discontinuation of certain contracts to align service offerings with our four global lines of business to capture synergies and further leverage our delivery platforms 
as a result of these strategic divestitures  we expect revenue growth  when compared to the corresponding periods in  to be stronger in the latter half of than in the first half of the year 
total revenues related to gm and its affiliates were billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
the percentage of total revenues from gm and its affiliates declined to in from in and in we expect this trend to continue as revenues from non gm clients are anticipated to increase  while revenues from gm are anticipated to decline in revenues from non gm clients in included a negative adjustment of million primarily as a result of a legal dispute with a client 
the negative impact of this adjustment was partially offset by a gain of million recorded to revenues resulting from the sale of a portion of our leasing portfolio 
other than gm  no client accounted for more than of our total revenues in  or costs and expenses 
our gross margin percentage 
revenues less cost of revenues revenues 
increased to in compared with in  which decreased from in as a result of our cost saving initiatives implemented during  we realized an improvement in our gross margins in the latter half of the year 
these improvements were partially offset by lower gross margins in the first half of the year 
the increase in was also due in part to negative adjustments to revenues in see revenues above 
the decrease in gross margins subsequent to was due primarily to a decrease in the gross margin on contracts with gm 
during and  we incurred additional costs necessary for the successful long term support of our contracts with gm 
in addition  billing rates for certain services provided to gm decreased in and  and commensurate cost reductions were not realized 
although the declines in revenues related to these existing services were partially offset by new contracts with gm for additional products and services  the gross margins on these new contracts were lower than historical levels 
the renegotiation of our sector agreements with gm covering its north american operations and gmac  which became effective january   is expected to adversely impact future revenues and margins attributable to our contracts with gm 
this negative impact on future margins is expected to be offset by cost savings resulting from initiatives implemented in that are designed to improve future operating margins associated with non gm clients 
see restructuring and other charges below 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in  and were  and  respectively 
the increase in was due in part to the recognition of million related to the retirements of the former chairman and vice chairman 
in addition  we incurred incremental sg a expenses during related to the improvement of certain of our internal systems  the implementation of the sap enterprise resource process system  increased spending on employee development and a management retention plan 
we also experienced rapid growth in our at kearney management consulting business  our unigraphics solutions inc software business and our business process management line of business  each of which has inherently higher sg a costs as a percentage of revenues than traditional systems and technology services 
during  we implemented plans designed to improve operating margins  including decreasing sg a as a percentage of revenues 
cost savings realized from these initiatives were partially offset by increased spending for marketing and branding  improvements to certain of our internal systems  and other areas of strategic importance 
restructuring and other charges 
in the first quarter of  we began the implementation of initiatives designed to reduce costs  streamline our organizational structure and exit certain operating activities 
as a result of these initiatives  we recorded restructuring charges and related asset writedowns totaling billion for the year ended december  amounts recorded for restructuring activities during provide for planned workforce reductions of approximately  employees  consisting of approximately  employees who accepted our early retirement offer and the involuntary termination of approximately  individuals employed throughout the company in managerial  professional  clerical  consulting and technical positions 
total involuntary termination and early retirement offer charges amounted to million  million of which pertains to a curtailment gain and special termination benefits related to the early retirement offer  including amounts under our defined benefit pension plan see note  and million from changes to the vesting conditions for unvested restricted stock units and options see note 
in addition  these initiatives have resulted in the exit of certain business activities  the consolidation of facilities and the writedown of certain assets to net realizable value 
charges associated with these actions include million relating to business exit and facilities consolidation costs  and asset writedowns of million 
the accrual for business exit activities and consolidation of facilities includes estimated costs of million to terminate software license agreements  million to terminate certain leases  million to terminate certain customer contracts and million for other costs 
these costs are associated with the exit of several lines of business  primarily within systems and technology services 
asset writedowns related to the restructuring activities consist of million to write off software  goodwill and other intangibles  and million for writedowns of computer related equipment and other assets 
such asset writedowns  which predominantly related to businesses that we have decided to exit in the systems and technology  business process management and consulting lines of business  were primarily determined based on the present value of anticipated future cash flows 
as of december   approximately  employees left the company through involuntary termination as a result of the initiatives  and approximately million of termination benefits have been charged to the accrual 
in addition  we paid approximately million in connection with the exit activities described above 
we expect that remaining cash expenditures relating to this charge will be incurred primarily in during  we implemented an enterprisewide business transformation initiative to reduce our costs  streamline our organizational structure  and align our strategy  services and delivery with market opportunities 
this initiative involved the elimination of approximately  positions through reassignment of personnel  elimination of open personnel requisitions  normal attrition and termination of employees 
as a result of this initiative  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million  primarily relating to the severance costs associated with the planned involuntary termination of approximately  employees 
in addition  we recorded asset writedowns of million relating to operations that we discontinued 
these operations primarily consisted of several processing centers that we consolidated and certain product lines and related services provided to certain industries 
asset writedowns relating to these product lines included investments  software  goodwill and other intangibles  and buildings and computer equipment 
we also recorded asset writedowns of million in and million in primarily relating to operating assets initially identified for sale in as of december   all such assets had been sold 
restructuring activities in and resulted in the involuntary termination of approximately  employees and the acceptance by approximately  employees of early retirement offers 
these restructuring activities have resulted in cash expenditures of million since the beginning of the second quarter of the restructuring actions contemplated under the and plans are essentially complete as of december   with remaining restructuring reserves comprised primarily of future severance related payments to terminated employees  future lease payments for exited facilities and accruals for other restructuring activities 
expected cost savings resulting from our initiatives are anticipated to play a significant role in our goal of achieving at least billion in annualized compensation and other operating expense reductions  as well as our goal of achieving an annualized operating margin by the end of the year these cost savings will be partially offset by increased spending for marketing and branding  improvements to certain of our internal systems  and other areas of strategic importance 
solid edge acquisition 
on march   our then wholly owned subsidiary unigraphics solutions inc ugs completed the acquisition of intergraph corporation s mechanical cad cam business for a purchase price of million  excluding approximately million of acquisition costs 
in connection with the allocation of the purchase price to identifiable intangible assets  ugs allocated million to in process research and development r d that was expensed upon acquisition 
the in process r d related to the modification of solid edge version software to include ugs parasolid solid modeling kernel software 
this project commenced in july and was completed in may initial sales of solid edge version solid edge occurred shortly thereafter 
the value assigned to in process r d was determined based on estimates of the resulting net cash flows from solid edge and the discounting of such cash flows to present value 
in projecting net cash flows resulting from solid edge  management estimated revenues  cost of sales  r d  sg a and income taxes for the software 
these estimates were based on the following assumptions 
estimated revenues projected a compound annual growth rate over five years of approximately  with annual growth rates ranging from to 
virtually all projected revenues were ascribed to solid edge because the integration of the parasolid solid modeling kernel software into solid edge was the critical enabling factor to allow the solid edge product to provide the geometric modeling capabilities and user interfaces necessary to compete with other products in the product design and consumer products markets 
in addition  management expected sales of solid edge to cease subsequent to may projections of revenue growth were based on management s estimates of market size and growth  supported by independent market data and by the nature and expected timing of the development of product enhancements and new products by ugs and its competitors 

the estimated cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was consistent with the historical rates for the solid edge business as well as industry standards 

estimated sg a costs were expected to increase as a percentage of sales  from in to in incremental sales in later years were expected to require proportionally greater selling efforts to meet revenue growth plans 

the estimated r d costs were expected to decrease as a percentage of sales  from in to in r d costs in were higher as a percentage of sales than projected for later years due to the costs of combining two r d departments in and the continuing r d efforts 

royalty income on the parasolid solid modeling kernel software was expected to be received by ugs from outside persons 
the royalty income associated with solid edge was assumed to be  the standard royalty rate for the parasolid solid modeling kernel software 
due to the declining value of solid edge over the future periods  the royalty income associated with solid edge  to determine the r d valuation  is reduced accordingly from in to in the projected net cash flows for solid edge were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital wacc based upon an analysis of the wacc for publicly traded companies within ugs industry 
the calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise 
a wacc of was also used to determine the value of the return on working capital and return on work force acquired as part of the purchase of solid edge 
in determining the appropriate wacc  ugs considered the attribution of a higher wacc to the in process technology due to the risks inherent in the development process  however  a higher wacc was not used because these risks had been significantly reduced by the acquisition date as evidenced by the completion of the development in early may 
in addition  the impact of the use of a higher wacc eg  on the amount of the purchase price allocated to in process r d was not material 
revenues of solid edge subsequent to the completion of development are lower than those used in projected net cash flows for purchase price allocation due to lower than expected sales performance on the part of u 
s 
distributors and a three month delay in the integration of solid edge distribution channels into ugs existing distribution network 
in addition  r d expenses associated with solid edge have also been lower than those used in the net cash flow projection 
as a result of the preceding factors  actual net cash flows approximate those used in our original projection 
management continues to believe that the original net cash flow projections for solid edge are reasonable 
other income expense 
the components of other income expense are presented below for the years ended december   and in millions interest and other income interest expense gain on sale of stock of subsidiary total other income expense increased to million in  compared with million in and million in interest and other income increased million in  to million  compared with million in  due primarily to the recognition of incremental gains resulting from the sale of our limited partnership portfolio and the disposition of certain investments 
interest and other income increased million in  to million  compared with million in  due primarily to incremental gains resulting from sales of assets and additional income from investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
interest expense increased million in to million  compared with million in  due to additional borrowings used primarily to finance the repurchase of our common stock and to partially fund the acquisition of systemhouse 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
interest expense decreased million to million in  compared with million in  due to a reduced level of debt 
also included in other income expense during was the recognition of a non taxable gain of million resulting from the sale of stock in connection with ugs initial public offering 
no taxes were provided for this gain as we believe we will recover our basis in the shares sold in a tax free manner 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rates in  and were  and  respectively 
net income 
net income including all charges  gains and adjustments discussed above decreased to million in  compared with million in and million in basic earnings per share decreased to per share from in and in diluted earnings per share decreased to per share in from in and in as discussed above  during we recorded pre tax restructuring and other charges  net of the reversal of certain previously recorded accruals  of billion and recorded pre tax gains of million resulting from the disposition of certain investments 
excluding these charges and gains  net income for would have been million  and basic and diluted earnings per share would have been and  respectively 
during we recorded certain pre tax charges and adjustments  including million related to senior executive retirements  million for a writeoff associated with acquired in process r d  million for asset writedowns  and million for revenue adjustments resulting primarily from a legal dispute with a client 
the negative impact of these items was partially offset by a non taxable gain of million associated with the sale of stock of ugs  a gain of million related to the sale of a portion of our leasing portfolio  and positive adjustments of million to reverse residual accruals related to previously recorded restructuring charges 
excluding these charges  gains and adjustments  net income would have been million  and basic and diluted earnings per share would have been and  respectively 
excluding pre tax charges of million in related to restructuring activities and asset writedowns  net income would have been million  and basic and diluted earnings per share would have been and  respectively 
the following table summarizes the adjustments discussed in the three preceding paragraphs dollars in millions  except per share amounts revenues as reported    adjusting items contract revenue adjustments sale of portion of leasing portfolio revenues pro forma    costs and expenses as reported    adjusting items restructuring activities related asset writedowns  senior executive retirements write off of acquired in process r d certain other asset writedowns costs and expenses pro forma    operating income pro forma    other income expense as reported adjusting items gain on disposition of certain investments gain on sale of stock of subsidiary other income expense pro forma income before income taxes pro forma    provision for income taxes pro forma net income pro forma earnings per share pro forma basic diluted percentage of completion 
we may from time to time modify our contractual arrangements with clients 
for client contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  such changes would be reflected in results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period the revisions are determined 
seasonality and inflation 
our revenues and net income vary over the calendar year  with the fourth quarter generally reflecting the highest revenues and net income for the year due to certain services that are purchased more heavily in that quarter as a result of the spending patterns of several clients 
in addition  revenues generally increase from quarter to quarter as a result of new business added throughout the year 
inflation generally had little effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
financial position assets 
total assets increased to billion at december   up from billion at december   due primarily to the acquisition of systemhouse 
at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of million  had working capital of million and a current ratio of to this compares with cash and cash equivalents of billion  billion in working capital  and a current ratio of to at december  liabilities and shareholders equity 
total debt increased to billion at december   from billion at december  total debt consists of notes payable  commercial paper and redeemable preferred stock of subsidiaries 
the increase in total debt in was attributable to additional borrowings used primarily to finance the repurchase of our common stock and to partially fund the acquisition of systemhouse 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately billion 
this repurchase is intended to serve as a hedge against our long term exposure with respect to outstanding options and restricted stock units 
to fund this repurchase  we completed the sale during october of million in principal amount of our notes due  million in principal amount of our notes due  and million in principal amount of our notes due the purchase of systemhouse for approximately billion was financed approximately with cash and with debt 
the total debt to capital ratio which includes total debt as a component of capital was and at december  and  respectively 
the ratio of non current debt to capital which includes non current debt as a component of capital was and at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  we had committed lines of credit of billion and billion  respectively  all of which was unused 
these lines of credit serve as backup for our commercial paper borrowings 
new accounting standards in june  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 was issued 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
the provisions of this statement are now effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june   although early adoption is allowed 
we plan to adopt the provisions of this sfas on january  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
derivative financial instruments we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into various hedging transactions to manage this risk 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivative transactions 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments  are included in note financial instruments and risk management 
interest rate risk 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of the issuance of short term commercial paper and variable rate notes 
however  the effects of interest rate changes are reduced by our management of our debt portfolio between fixed and variable rate instruments as well as the utilization of interest rate swaps 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in short term market interest rates 
if these rates average more in than in  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  had short term market interest rates averaged more than in  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
publicly traded equity price sensitivity 
our financial position is affected by changes in publicly traded equity prices as a result of certain investments 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in the value of our publicly traded equity security investments 
if the market price of our investments in publicly traded equity securities in were to fall by below the level at the end of  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  had the market price of our investments in publicly traded equity securities fallen by below the end of  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
foreign exchange risk 
we conduct business in the united states and around the world 
our most significant foreign currency transaction exposures relate to canada  the united kingdom  those western european countries who use the euro as a common currency  australia and new zealand 
the company has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due from and the net assets of selected subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies against fluctuations in exchange rates 
we have not entered into forward foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
in  we discontinued the use of a value at risk model to assess the foreign exchange market risk of derivative instruments in favor of a one to one matching of contracts against exposures 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with durations of generally less than twelve months to hedge such transactions 
gains and losses related to hedges of firm commitments or other transactions qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are deferred in accrued liabilities and recognized in earnings at the time of recognition of the underlying hedged transaction 
all other foreign exchange contracts are marked to market on a current basis 
to the extent hedges of firm commitments are no longer effective as hedges of the underlying transaction  they are closed  with gains and losses recognized in earnings on a current basis 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in foreign currency rates against the us dollar 
if these rates averaged more in than in  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  had foreign currency rates averaged more than in  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december   and  net cash provided by operating activities was billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
the decrease in as compared with was due primarily to a decrease in net income prior to non cash items 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities increased billion from  to billion  due primarily to payments related to the acquisition of systemhouse and a decrease in proceeds from divestitures  partially offset by a decrease in payments for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and investments and other assets  as well as from increased proceeds from the sale of investments and other assets 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities decreased million from  to million  due primarily to proceeds from divestitures 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities decreased million  to million  compared with million in  due primarily to a net increase in proceeds from long term debt partially offset by funds used to repurchase our common stock 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities decreased million  to million  compared with billion in the prior year  due primarily to a decrease in the amount of reduction of debt 
we paid cash dividends totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect that the principal use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for capital expenditures and working capital 
capital expenditures may consist of purchases of computer and telecommunications equipment  buildings and facilities  land  and software  as well as acquisitions and joint ventures 
we estimate that gross capital expenditures during  excluding acquisition and joint venture activities as well as anticipated proceeds from divestitures  will be approximately billion 
total capital expenditures for will depend to a significant extent on the level of our acquisition and joint venture activities  capital requirements for new business and proceeds from divestitures 
we anticipate that cash reserves  cash flows from operations and unused borrowing capacity under the existing lines of credit will provide sufficient funds to meet our needs for at least the next year
