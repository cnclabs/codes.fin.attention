the company also markets sports nutrition products under the prolab brand name 
prolab products are sold primarily in the health food store channel of trade as well as health clubs and gyms and internationally in select countries through international distributors

another aspect of the company s business is the marketing of nutraceutical grade raw materials  primarily garlic and other vegetable powders to other manufacturers of nutritional supplement products 
the company also manufactures certain products pursuant to contracts with customers who distribute the products under their own private labels 
sales to private label customers accounted for of the company s revenues for approximately of private label sales in were to one customer which the company believes was a one time opportunity and will not be repeated in the year the company s strategy with respect to private label sales is to take advantage of its excess manufacturing capacity by offering to manufacture products for other vendors 
the company does not foresee adding capacity in order to meet private label demand and as such it does not foresee private label sales growing as a percentage of its total business 
the growth of the company s revenue has been a result of success in gaining additional distribution in new retail outlets and new channels of distribution  new product introductions  as well as the addition of new product lines and businesses through acquisition 
for example in  the company began a major effort to break into the mass market channel of distribution 
sales in that channel have since grown to more than of the company s branded business 
natrol products are now visible in such stores as walgreens  rite aid  walmart  eckerd  cvs  and target 
more recently the company has made progress in the internet channel of distribution 
the customer s internet customers include vitamin shoppes  planetrx and mothernature 
natrol s growth has been supported by the introduction of new products 
melatonin  dhea  st 
john s wort  and msm were introduced in    and respectively and have heavily affected sales in each of those years as well as the year following 
typically  hot new products attract a wide audience that drives high volumes of initial sales 
these high volumes generally taper off as fad users stop using the product 
while hot products sales can fade  sales of such products typically reach a base level that is sustained by a core group of users 
the length of these cycles can vary from less than a year to several years 
melatonin  dhea and st 
john s wort have all cycled in this fashion 
in each case the base level of sales fell to below of the product s peak 
during  for example  st john s wort sales decreased from s level 
the company is not certain that this product has yet reached its base level and sales of st 
john s wort products could fall further from the peak level reached in offsetting the fall in st 
john s wort were sales of the company s msm line of products introduced in with broader distribution occurring in the company continually works to develop new products that can replace or supercede older products whose popularity might be fading 
the company has also grown through acquisitions  completing two in and one in each acquisition introduced the company to a new line of business

year disclosure in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year compliant 
in mid  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and we believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the costs incurred to assess  remediate  and test the it and non it systems through were primarily fixed labor costs and not significant 
in addition  as we have not yet encountered any significant year disruptions in  future costs are also not expected to be significant 
we will continue to monitor our critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
impact of inflation generally  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s historical operations or profitability 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the risks related to foreign currency exchange rates are immaterial and the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
the company is subject to interest rate market risk associated with its variable rate line of credit and fixed rate long term debt 
given the short term nature and variable rates on borrowings on the line  the company does not believe that the risk is significant 
additionally  the company does not believe that the risk is significant for its long term debt due to the low fixed rate and insignificance of the long term debt to the company s consolidated balance sheet
