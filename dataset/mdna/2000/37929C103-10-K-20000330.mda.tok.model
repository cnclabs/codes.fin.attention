item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is engaged in the discovery and development of biosurgical and therapeutic products to improve surgical outcomes and to treat neurological disorders 
the biosurgical products include the adcon family of products  which are proprietary  resorbable  carbohydrate polymer medical devices designed to inhibit surgical scarring and adhesions 
based on european pivotal clinical studies and other compliance efforts and submission of data  the company obtained regulatory clearance to affix ce marking on adcon l and adcon t n in august and january  respectively  thereby allowing adcon l and adcon t n to be marketed in the european countries which recognize ce marking for lumbar disc surgery and tendon and peripheral nerve surgeries  respectively 
the company is currently marketing adcon l and adcon t n through independent medical device distributors in approximately countries outside the united states  including the major countries in the european union pursuant to its ce marking 
the company also commenced sales of adcon l in the united states in june in september  the fda issued a warning letter to emcm  which led to an import ban on all adcon l shipments to the united states 
after a successful re inspection of emcm s facilities  the import ban was lifted in december and the company resumed shipments of adcon l to the united states in january in addition  the company signed a development and exclusive license agreement in december with chugai for the sale of adcon l and adcon t n in japan 
the company anticipates that a significant portion of revenue from product sales will be derived from its adcon family of products  primarily adcon l 
further  the company is also pursuing the development of other biosurgical products and small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of several neurological disorders  including adhd  sleep disorders  anxiety  schizophrenia and ad 
in october  the company entered into a strategic alliance with janssen to collaborate on the discovery and development of therapeutic models to treat ad 
in may  janssen ceased funding this endeavor 
the company believes that janssen does not intend to select a lead compound from the identified compounds or pursue clinical trials relating to any such compound 
the company is in discussion with janssen to transfer development rights of these compounds to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such development rights from janssen or  if the company is successful  that such rights will be obtained on favorable terms

adcon l was approved for marketing in the united states by the fda in may the company commenced sales of adcon l in the united states in june the increase in total revenues for fiscal is slightly offset by a decrease in research contracts revenues 
this decrease in the company s research contracts revenues was due to janssen no longer funding the collaboration efforts with the company 
the company s government funded grant revenues increased slightly in compared to this increase was a result of the award of two small business innovation research sbir phase ii grants  one awarded in the third quarter of and one awarded in the second quarter of operating costs and expenses

research and development expenses increased by million or to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was primarily due to four factors an increase in development expenses for perceptin  which received approval from the fda in the fourth quarter of to begin phase ii clinical trials  the increased clinical research costs associated with the initiation of the pilot clinical trials of adcon a  the increased clinical research cost associated with the pilot clinical trials for the use of adcon l in breast augmentation surgeries  and the start of a product development program for schizophrenia and dementia involving the regulation of human glycine transporters 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million or to approximately million in compared to approximately million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in the sales and marketing expenses and sales commissions resulting from the sales and marketing of adcon l in the united states and a non recurring expense of  for severance obligations for former employees 
these increases were somewhat offset by a reduction to the bad debt allowance resulting from a more favorable collection history than originally anticipated 
the expense included  of costs associated with the company s effort to select and finance a new building for its future research and development and corporate headquarters facility 
this project was terminated as of december  since then  the company has pursued an alternate site 
interest income

if the company is successful in other phase i research  additional phase ii awards may be sought for funding to aid in further development of pharmaceutical compounds  however  there is no assurance that such phase i research will be successful or that additional funding will be obtained 
the company does not expect to generate a positive cash flow from operations until the fourth quarter of due to the substantial costs for commercialization of adcon l  additional research and development costs for its other biosurgical products and costs related to its neurosurgical disorders programs  preclinical testing  clinical trials and operating expenses associated with supporting such activities 
the company s ability to generate a positive cash flow from operations is dependent upon several factors  including the timing and content of decisions by the fda 
there is no assurance when the company will generate a positive cash flow  if at all 
the company may need to raise substantial additional capital to fund its operations prior to such time 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on  and could increase as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  the cost for commercialization of adcon l  the commercialization success of its adcon family of products  the progress of the company s research and development  including the costs related to its cognition modulation perceptin  ad  schizophrenia and other neurological disorders programs  the scope  timing and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the cost and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals  the company s success in obtaining the strategic alliances required to fund certain of its programs  the rate of technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of certain of the company s product candidates  the status of competitive products and the establishment of additional manufacturing capacity 
the company from time to time is involved in various stages of discussion or negotiation regarding acquisitions or mergers and from time to time other strategic alternatives 
as of the date hereof  no definitive agreement with respect to any such transaction or other strategic alternative has been entered into

year the company did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in its operating or business systems when the date changed from to based on operations since january   the company does not expect any significant impact to its on going business as a result of the year issue 
however it is possible that the full impact of the date change  which was of concern due to computer programs that use two digits instead of four digits to define years  has not been fully recognized 
for example  it is possible that year or similar issues such as leap year related problems may occur with billing  payroll  or financial closing at month  quarterly or year end 
the company believes that any such problems are likely to be minor and correctable 
in addition  the company could still be negatively impacted if the year or similar issues adversely affect its customers or suppliers 
the company currently is not aware of any significant year or similar problems that have arisen for its customers and suppliers 
the company expended approximately  on year readiness efforts from to these efforts included replacing some outdated  noncompliant hardware and noncompliant software as well as identifying and remediating year problems 
the funds for year readiness were from normal operating cash flow

although certain of the company s products are being sold in the participating countries through independent distributors  the company receives revenues from such sales in us dollars 
as a result  the company does not anticipate that the introduction and use of the euro will materially affect the company s business  prospects  results of operations or financial condition
