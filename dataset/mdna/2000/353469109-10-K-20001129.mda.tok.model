restructuring during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s board of directors approved a plan to restructure the company s operations  reduce its workforce and formally exit the majority of its leased office space located in provo  utah 
these changes were intended to align the company s products  services  and channels in a manner that focuses company resources on providing integrated learning and performance solutions to both individuals and organizations

increased sales from the company s retail stores  wholesale channels  and the internet were partially offset by decreased sales from the catalog  mass markets  and government products channels 
retail store sales increased as a result of new stores and a percent increase in comparable store sales 
at august   the company was operating stores compared to stores at august  comparable store sales growth during the year was primarily fueled by increased sales of handheld electronic devices  such as the palm v tm by palm  inc  bundled with the company s franklin planner tm software  as well as sales of related accessories 
sales of handheld electronic devices and accessories represented a significantly larger percentage of total consumer product sales during fiscal as the popularity of handheld electronic devices continues to grow  the company anticipates further sales growth from these devices in future periods 
however  future sales growth is dependent upon a number of factors  including the availability of products from manufacturers  changes in technology and consumer preferences  and the introduction of new products from competitors 
the company also had increased sales from its wholesale channels including the contract stationer channel primarily due to increased demand from existing sales and marketing agreements  the successful introduction of new products  and the addition of new marketing and distribution agreements 
increased internet sales were the result of continued changes in general consumer buying habits  ongoing improvements to the company s electronic commerce infrastructure  and special promotions advertised in the company s catalogs and on its web site at www 
franklincovey 
com 
increased sales in these channels were partially offset by decreased sales from the catalog  mass markets and government products channel 
the company s catalog operation continues to be adversely affected by increased internet sales  which the company attributes to continuing changes in consumer buying preferences 
although catalog sales declined during fiscal  catalog sales combined with internet sales increased nine percent compared to the prior year 
sales through the mass market channel decreased due to the termination of an agreement with a mass market distributor 
government product sales continued to be adversely affected by uncertainties surrounding the potential closure of gsa depots and service centers 
training and education sales increased by million  or four percent  compared to fiscal increased sales from premier agendas  sales effectiveness  and leadership programs were partially offset by decreased sales from productivity seminars and personal coaching 
premier agendas  which provides leadership and productivity solutions to students and others in the education market  increased sales by percent over the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of schools that use premier s products and services 
increased sales effectiveness revenue was due to new contracts and increased demand for seminars taught by khalsa associates  which was acquired by the company during fiscal increased leadership program sales were primarily due to improved organizational sales  especially for custom programs  and related business development program sales 
productivity program sales decreased primarily due to the timing of specialized product orders in the prior year and a decline in public seminar revenues 
during fiscal  the company restructured its public seminar operations  which resulted in marketing and program delivery changes designed to improve public seminar profitability 
during fiscal  training sales in general were adversely affected by the relocation of certain sales associates to new regional sales offices 
personal coaching sales were adversely affected by decreased demand for coaching from one of its major clients 
in response  the company entered into a joint venture with american marketing systems  inc  a major customer of the personal coaching division  effective september  the new company  franklin covey coaching  llc  will continue to provide personal coaching services for the company and other existing clients

international sales decreased million  or one percent  compared to the prior year 
increased sales in canada  mexico  and brazil were offset by decreased sales in australia  japan  the middle east  and new zealand 
sales in canada increased primarily due to improved training sales resulting from additional sales personnel hired during fiscal to expand company operations in canada 
increased sales in mexico were primarily due to two new retail stores  increased catalog sales  and the company purchasing the mexico licensee and combining its operations with the company s direct office already established in mexico 
in may  the company opened a direct office in brazil and has since recognized increased sales in that country 
prior to may  all sales primarily product sales were serviced through the corporate office 
decreased sales performance in australia was due to decreased training sales at one of australia s largest customers  reorganization of the sales force  and the timing of speaking engagements by stephen r 
covey  which increased training sales in the prior year 
sales in japan decreased due to sales force restructuring and declining book sales 
in fiscal  the habits of highly effective families book was released  while no new major publications were released during fiscal decreased sales in the middle east were due to the company changing its business strategy in the region from a direct office to licensee operations 
as a result  the company receives a royalty based upon a percentage of the licensee s sales rather than recognizing percent of sales generated in the middle east 
sales decreased in new zealand due to closure of the new zealand office during fiscal future sales and business activity in new zealand will be serviced through the australian office 
other sales  which consist primarily of the company s commercial printing and tabbing operations  decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal the decrease was due to the sale of the commercial printing division of publishers press  which was effective february  gross margin gross margin consists of sales less cost of sales 
the company s cost of sales includes materials used in the production of planners and related products  assembly and manufacturing labor costs  commissions of training consultants  direct costs of conducting seminars  freight  and certain other overhead costs 
gross margin may be affected by  among other things  prices of materials  labor rates  product mix  changes in product discount levels  production efficiency  training consultant commissions  and freight costs 
gross margin was percent of sales compared to percent in fiscal the company s gross margin improved primarily due to product write offs related to the restructuring plan which were expensed in fiscal  and to new inventory procurement and management procedures  which reduced the amount of product write offs during fiscal partially offsetting these improvements were the adverse effects of product mix changes  decreased sales of certain training programs and increased wholesale channel sales 
during fiscal  the company began a restructuring plan that examined all aspects of the business 
in connection with this review  certain products and curricula were discontinued 
additionally  the company actively sought to optimize inventory levels through improved policies and procedures 
these improved procedures had a favorable effect on the company s gross margin during fiscal as previously described  the company experienced significantly increased sales of handheld electronic devices during fiscal although handheld electronic devices have favorably affected sales performance  these electronic devices have gross margins that are lower than the majority of the company s other products and services 
as sales of handheld electronic devices continue to grow  and increase as a percentage of total company sales  further gross margin erosion may occur 
in addition  decreased sales of higher margin training program revenues  primarily productivity programs and personal coaching  also adversely affected the company s gross margin 
increased sales through wholesale channels continues to unfavorably affect the company s gross margin through contracted pricing terms that have produced increased sales volume  but at lower margins 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative sg a costs increased million to percent of sales compared to percent of sales during fiscal increased sg a expenses were primarily due to ongoing development of electronic based products and services  electronic commerce channels  spending to support expected growth in the premier business  newly acquired businesses  increased promotional expenses  the addition of new retail stores  and increased consulting costs associated with projects related to the company s restructuring plan 
the increases were partially offset by a decrease in core employee costs as a result of headcount reduction efforts 
throughout fiscal  the company aggressively invested in the development and marketing of new electronic based products  on line training programs  and various application tools 
due to the significant increase in handheld electronic devices and related accessories  the company increased its customer support services for these products 
additionally  the company continued to invest in improvements to its electronic commerce infrastructure to meet changing consumer preferences and committed significant resources to the development of its internet web site and other on line products and services  such as www

com 
the company believes that the development of on line products and services  combined with an efficient e commerce base will enable it to achieve a competitive advantage in the future by providing a variety of tools in various formats to enable organizations and individuals to craft effective solutions to meet their needs 
premier  which develops and produces planners and other solutions for the educational market  increased its sg a spending as a result of a new regional office and additional headcount necessary to support expected growth in fiscal and beyond 
the purchases of the professional resources organization and daytracker 
com  which were acquired during fiscal  have also resulted in increased total sg a expenses compared to the prior year 
the company also increased its promotional spending  primarily for catalogs and direct mailings  to advertise new products and to improve public program sales

depreciation expense increased by million compared to the prior year primarily due to purchases of computer hardware and software  office furniture and fixtures  manufacturing equipment  and the addition of leasehold improvements in new stores and regional sales offices 
amortization charges increased by million primarily due to the amortization of goodwill related to contingent earnout payments made to the former owners of premier and personal coaching  and the acquisition of daytracker 
com 
stock option purchase and relocation costs during fiscal  the company expensed million of additional costs primarily to reacquire outstanding stock options and to relocate the majority of its sales associates to new regional offices 
in an effort to reduce the potentially dilutive effect of outstanding options on the company s capital structure  the company actively sought to reacquire outstanding stock options from both current and former employees 
the majority of option purchase costs were incurred in connection with a tender offer made by the company during its third fiscal quarter to purchase all outstanding options with an exercise price of or higher 
as a result of the tender offer and previous purchases of option shares  the company acquired  option shares for a total cost of million 
the remaining million was spent primarily to relocate certain sales associates to new regional offices 
at august  all regional sales offices were operating and the company expects to see increased training sales in future periods from this new strategy 
these costs have been included as a separate expense component in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended august  interest expense interest expense decreased million primarily due to lower long term debt balances during fiscal long term debt decreased due to the retirement of million of notes payable during october the notes payable were retired using existing cash balances and the company s expanded lines of credit 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate continues to be adversely affected by non deductible goodwill amortization  the effect of foreign losses  and the magnified effects of other non deductible items resulting from decreased taxable income 
amortization of goodwill primarily generated from the merger with covey leadership center and certain other acquisitions is not deductible for income tax purposes and had an adverse effect on the company s effective tax rate 
during fiscal  the effect of foreign losses was primarily comprised of losses sustained in japan  australia  and new zealand for which no offsetting tax benefit could be recognized due to uncertain future taxable income to offset such losses 
preferred stock dividends in connection with the issuance of  shares of preferred stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed a subscription offering for up to an additional  shares of preferred stock during fiscal the subscription offering closed during the company s second quarter of fiscal with  shares purchased under terms of the offering 
as a result  the increase in preferred stock dividends was due to the full year impact of previously issued shares and the subscription offering that closed during fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal sales consumer products sales increased million  or four percent  compared to the prior year 
sales increases from the company s retail stores  contract stationer channels  and the internet were offset by decreased sales from catalog operations and government products 
retail store sales increased due to five additional stores and a two percent increase in comparable store sales 
at august   the company was operating retail stores compared to stores at august  comparable store sales growth was primarily attributable to increased sales of technology related products  as well as the introduction of limited edition planners such as the hallmark r and shoebox r planners 
the company also had increased sales from contract stationer channels due to increased demand from new marketing and distribution agreements 
sales from the internet channel have increased due to general changes in consumer buying habits and ongoing enhancements to the company s electronic commerce infrastructure 
increased sales from these channels were partially offset by decreased sales from the government products group and the company s catalog operations 
product sales to the us government continued to be adversely affected by changes in the government procurement process 
sales growth in other distribution channels  including retail stores  contract stationers  and the internet  continue to have an adverse affect on catalog sales 
price increases did not have a material effect on sales growth between the periods 
training and education sales decreased by million  or one percent  compared to the prior year 
sales increases from premier  personal coaching  and direct product channels were offset by sales decreases in core training programs and a decline in book royalties 
premier continues to expand its share of the school agenda market and recognized a percent increase in sales  primarily from new customers 
new business from both personal coaching and the direct products channel resulted in increased sales during fiscal these increases in training and education sales were offset by decreased core training sales  primarily from corporate on site and facilitated programs for leadership training 
in addition  book royalties decreased due to the decline in royalties received from the habits of highly effective families book that was released in fiscal international sales increased by million  or percent  compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of a former licensee in japan  which occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal partially offsetting this increase were decreased sales in canada and the middle east 
the company s canadian operations were adversely affected as a result of labor disputes at one of its largest clients 
also during fiscal  the company converted its middle eastern direct office into a licensee operation 
although this conversion reduced expenses and certain other business risks  the company only receives licensee royalties on qualifying sales 
other geographic regions recorded nominal sales fluctuations compared to the prior year 
other sales  which consist of the company s commercial printing services and fitness training sales  decreased million  or percent  compared to the prior year 
the decrease was due to the sale of the company s institute of fitness  which recognized sales of million during fiscal  but was sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease resulting from the institute of fitness sale was partially offset by increased commercial printing sales at publishers press 
gross margin gross margin was percent of sales for fiscal  compared to percent in the prior year 
the company s gross margin was adversely affected during fiscal by inventory write offs  changes in product mix  channel pricing  decreased core training volume  and declining book royalties 
the company s product mix continues to be affected by an overall decrease in high margin planner sales and an increase in lower margin technology related product sales 
increased sales from the contract stationer channel also adversely affected gross margin due to contracted pricing terms that have resulted in higher unit sales volume  but at reduced margins 
core training programs offered by the company have gross margins that are generally higher than the company s gross margin on product sales 
continued declining sales of these higher margin programs resulted in a lower total gross margin for the company during fiscal additionally  book royalties received in the prior year reflect the impact of the habits of highly effective families  which was released in fiscal and had declining sales during the year  thus directly impacting the company s gross margin in fiscal operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  to percent of sales  compared to percent in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the development of electronic based products and electronic commerce channels  increased promotional spending during the fourth quarter  and the acquisition of king bear

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company increased its promotional spending  primarily for catalogs and direct mailings  to advertise new products  such as the millennium edition of the franklin planner  and to improve training program sales performance 
increased sg a expenses can also be attributed to the acquisition of king bear during fiscal  which added million of incremental expenses to fiscal these increases were partially offset by the sale of the institute of fitness  which recorded million of sg a expenses prior to its sale in fiscal depreciation charges increased by million over the prior year primarily due to new computer software and hardware purchased in conjunction with the company s business transformation project and the addition of leasehold improvements for new stores 
equipment and software purchased in connection with the business transformation project are depreciated over estimated useful lives of three to five years 
amortization charges increased by million due to amortization of contingent earnout payments made during the second quarter of fiscal and the amortization of certain business transformation project costs 
restructuring costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company initiated a restructuring plan designed to restructure the company s operations  reduce its workforce and formally exit the majority of its leased office space located in provo  utah 
as part of the restructuring plan  the company intended to reduce its workforce from  employees to approximately  employees 
the cost to provide severance and related benefits was estimated to be million 
also included in the restructuring provision is a charge to exit certain leased office space in provo  utah 
these facilities formerly accommodated sales  marketing  and other functions primarily aligned with the training and education sbu 
loss on impaired assets at each balance sheet date  the company reviews its goodwill  other intangible assets  and other long term assets to determine whether events or circumstances may have occurred which indicate possible impairment 
as part of the restructuring plan initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal  all programs  products  and curriculum were evaluated to determine their future value in the restructured company 
as a result of this evaluation  certain products  services  and curricula were discontinued 
other intangible and long term assets were also reviewed for future value using undiscounted cash flows or other appropriate valuation methodologies 
based upon this analysis  the company recognized a million loss on impaired long lived assets for the year ended august  interest expense interest expense increased million  primarily due to increased borrowing on the company s long term line of credit to purchase shares of the company s common stock during fiscal income taxes during fiscal  the company recognized income tax expense of million 
although the company had a loss before income taxes of million  non deductible goodwill amortization from the merger with covey leadership center and other acquisitions  foreign income tax expense  and losses in foreign countries resulted in a net taxable position for the year

preferred stock dividends during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company issued  shares of series a preferred stock for million in cash to a private investor 
the preferred stock dividends accrue at an annual rate of percent and are payable quarterly in cash or additional shares of preferred stock until july  accordingly  the company accrued million in preferred stock dividends as of august  subsequent to august   the company paid the accrued dividend with additional shares of preferred stock 
quarterly results the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated financial data for the most recent eight quarters

the company s quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of customers who renew their franklin planners on a calendar year basis 
training and education sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training  which is not typically scheduled during holiday and vacation periods  and the timing of premier agenda s sales  which occur primarily in the company s fourth quarter 
in the company s experience  catalog sales  retail store sales  and net income tend to be lower during the third quarter of each fiscal year 
the seasonal nature of the company s operations has historically resulted in higher sales and significantly higher operating margins during the first  second  and fourth quarters  with declines in sales and income occurring during the third quarter of each fiscal year 
the company believes that the seasonal pattern of sales and earnings during its fiscal year will continue as in the past  exclusive of restructuring and other similar charges 
during fiscal  the company incurred and expensed million for other costs related to its restructuring plan which were not specific to severance or leased office space exit costs 
these costs were primarily comprised of charges resulting from a stock option tender offer and other purchases of outstanding stock options  and to relocate sales associates to new regional sales offices 
these costs have been classified as a separate component of operating expenses 
in an effort to reduce the potentially dilutive effect of stock options on the company s capital structure  the company was actively engaged in purchasing stock options from current and former employees 
as part of this strategy  the company filed a tender offer statement with the sec that closed during the company s third quarter of fiscal under terms of the offer  the company paid cash for the outstanding option shares  which were priced using a market value methodology 
as a result of the tender offer and previous purchases of option shares  the company reacquired  option shares for million in cash 
the remaining million was primarily used to relocate the company s sales force to eight new regional offices that were opened during fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company initiated a restructuring plan that resulted in a million charge to operations 
included in the restructuring charge were costs necessary to reduce the company s workforce by approximately employees and to exit the majority of leased office space in provo  utah 
the company reassessed the severance portion of the restructuring accrual during the fourth quarter of fiscal and reduced the remaining accrual by million 
the adjustment was primarily due to favorable economic conditions that allowed former employees to find new jobs more quickly than expected and resulted in reduced severance costs 
also during fiscal  the company exited the leased office space located in provo  utah and obtained a subleasee for the property 
after an assessment of the sublease terms  the company adjusted its restructuring accrual by million during the third quarter of fiscal to reflect lower than expected building transition costs 
as of august   accrued severance costs consisted of expected remaining severance and benefit payments for affected employees 
remaining accrued leased office space exit costs consisted of items such as the difference between the base rental charge and sublease revenues over time and tenant improvements 
as of august   the restructuring plan was substantially complete and the company expects that the remaining restructuring accrual will be sufficient to complete its restructuring plan 
as part of its restructuring plan  and upon review of certain goodwill  intangibles  and other long term assets  the company recognized a loss on impaired assets totaling million during the fourth quarter of fiscal quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the addition of new institutional customers  the introduction of new products  the timing of large institutional orders  and the opening of new retail stores 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary sources of capital have been net cash provided by operating activities  long term borrowing  and line of credit financing 
working capital requirements have also been financed through short term borrowing and line of credit financing 
in addition to these sources  the company issued preferred stock to a private investor in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and to existing shareholders through a subscription offering during fiscal the subscription offering closed on november  with  shares of preferred stock purchased under terms of the offering 
the preferred stock issued to shareholders was substantially identical to preferred shares previously issued to the private investor 
net proceeds from the subscription offering were million 
net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
adjustments to net loss for fiscal included million of depreciation and amortization charges 
the primary sources of cash from operations resulted from improved collections of accounts receivable and reduced inventories 
in contrast with recent fiscal years  the collection of accounts receivable resulted in a net source of cash to the company in spite of continued fourth quarter sales growth at premier agendas 
during fiscal  the company implemented new accounts receivable collection policies and procedures at its core operations  which reduced the number of receivable days outstanding and improved cash flows 
the company also implemented new inventory procedures designed to optimize inventory levels  which contributed to reduced inventory levels compared with the prior year 
additionally  the company utilized certain income tax benefits and various tax strategies to minimize required income tax payments throughout the year

in connection with its restructuring plan  the company recorded a million accrual in fiscal for expected costs to reduce the workforce and exit certain leased office space  which is included as a component of cash flows from operations

the company also received million in cash from the sale of certain land and a non business related building

at august   the company had million of senior unsecured notes payable the notes payable outstanding
