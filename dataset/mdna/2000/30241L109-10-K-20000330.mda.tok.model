net sales for the year ended december  increased million compared to the corresponding period in the period included net sales of the combined company  while the period included net sales of the peo operations only through february  and net sales of the combined company thereafter 
microelectronics segment product sales increased million in compared to of this increase  million was attributable to the micrion product division 
microelectronics segment service sales increased million in compared to  with micrion contributing million of the increase 
industry conditions in both the semiconductor manufacturing sector and the data storage sector were generally stronger in than in in addition  the development of new applications for the microelectronics segment products contributed to increased demand 
unit volume in the segment increased by from to and average selling price also increased by 
the increase in average selling price is partially due to increased prices  and partially due to changes in product mix towards higher value systems 
from to  microelectronics segment product sales increased million  while service revenues for this segment increased million

electron optics segment product sales increased million in compared to electron optics segment service sales increased million in compared to the company introduced a new series of tem products in late and strong demand for these products contributed to the sales increase in sales of the company s sem products decreased from to  primarily due to increased competition 
growth in segment service revenues was due to the company s increasing installed base of systems and the acquisition of additional sales and service businesses from philips in late  which contributed million in service revenues 
from to  electron optics segment product sales decreased million  primarily due to increased competition and softness in the materials and life sciences market sectors  while service revenues for this segment increased million from to growth in segment service revenues was due to the company s increasing installed base 
product sales in the components segment decreased million in compared to the demand for components segment products was weak in the first half of  due to customers utilization of on hand inventories 
from to  components segment product sales increased million due to strong demand from oem manufacturers 
years ended december  sales by geographic region north america europe asia pacific rest of world year over year sales increased from to in each of the three major geographic regions in which the company sells  north america  europe  and asia pacific 
in north america  sales increased by million from to due to increased demand in the semiconductor industry in that region 
in europe  sales increased by million from to largely due to increased service revenue resulting from the increase in the company s installed base of systems and also the acquisition of additional sales and service businesses from philips in late in the asia pacific region  sales increased by million from to due to increased demand in the data storage industry in that region 
from to  sales in north america increased million  sales in europe increased million and sales in the asia pacific region decreased million 
the increase in sales in europe was primarily due to the increase in electron optics service sales 
sales declined in the asia pacific region in largely due to the depressed general economic condition of the region 
in addition to the us dollar  the company conducts significant business in euros  british pounds  and japanese yen 
in general  the us dollar was stronger in relation to the euro and the underlying european currencies and british pound and weaker in relation to the japanese yen during as compared to accordingly  the translation of sales denominated in european currencies resulted in lower reported sales in us dollars in as compared to the translation of sales denominated in japanese yen resulted in higher reported sales in us dollars in as compared with in  the us dollar was generally stronger in relation to european currencies and weaker in relation to the japanese yen as compared to gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin was  and for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
the gross profit was negatively impacted by million of non cash inventory step up adjustments related to the micrion acquisition 
without these purchase accounting effects  the gross margin would have been 
during the third quarter of  the company recognized charges totaling million in cost of sales for inventory write offs  obsolescence reserves  reserves for product upgrades  and increased warranty reserves 
excluding the effect of these charges  the gross margin would have been for the year ended december  in addition  the write up of pre combination fei s inventory from cost to fair market value and the resulting increase in cost of goods sold had a negative impact on gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  this write up of pre combination fei s assets was a result of the reverse acquisition accounting applied to the peo combination 
the improvement in the company s gross margin over the last three years was primarily due to changes in product mix  partially off set by a higher percentage of total sales attributed to the service business  on which the company earns a lower gross margin than on product sales 
the gross margin also benefited from the purchase of the additional sales and distribution businesses from philips in late  which resulted in a higher proportion of direct sales versus distributor sales 
in general  distributor sales carry a lower gross margin but require lower levels of selling  general and administrative costs 
in late the company expanded its distributor arrangements in the asia pacific region and anticipates that increased distributor sales in asia pacific will off set the increased direct sales in europe 
other margin improvement contributions resulted from outsourcing activities which occurred in and for several mechanical and electrical subassemblies 
in addition  the company s service business is not expected to grow as rapidly as the anticipated growth in product sales over the near term 
research and development costs 
research and development r d costs for increased million compared to and increased million in compared to as a percentage of sales  r d costs were  and for  and  respectively 
micrion accounted for million of additional r d expenses in r d expense is reported net of subsidies and capitalized software development costs 
these off sets to r d expense increased by million from to excluding the effects of these increased off sets and the effect of the micrion acquisition  r d expense increased million from to the increase reflects increased efforts to develop certain technologies for new products 
expenditures for these efforts represented million of the increase over expenditures 
the expense includes the write off of million of previously capitalized software development costs in the first quarter 
the costs do not include pre combination fei prior to the peo combination date of february  selling  general and administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs for increased million compared to  and increased million in compared to as a percentage of sales  sg a costs were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in sg a costs in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of micrion in august  which added million in expenses  as well as the acquisition of the additional sales and service businesses from philips  which added million to the expense 
the increase in sg a costs for was primarily attributable to increased salary and related personnel costs of million 
a portion of the increase stems from the comparison of the twelve month period of the combined company with approximately ten months for the combined company in the period 
the first quarter of also included million in bad debt expenses 
amortization of purchased goodwill and technology 
purchase accounting for the peo combination as of february  resulted in the recognition of intangible assets in the amount of million for existing technology that is being amortized over a year period  and goodwill of million that is being amortized over a year period 
purchase accounting for the micrion acquisition as of august  resulted in the recognition of intangible assets in the amount of million for existing technology that is being amortized over a year period  and goodwill of million that is being amortized over a year period 
amortization of purchased goodwill and technology increased by million in compared with as a result of the micrion acquisition 
amortization of purchased goodwill and technology for increased million compared to  reflecting months amortization from the peo combination compared to approximately ten months amortization in amortization of purchased goodwill and technology is expected to increase to approximately million in from the effects of a full year of amortization of the micrion acquisition intangibles 
purchased in process research and development 
purchase accounting for the peo combination in resulted in the recognition of an intangible asset in the amount of million representing the estimated fair value of in process research and development of pre combination fei 
purchase accounting for the micrion acquisition in resulted in the recognition of an intangible asset in the amount of million representing the estimated fair value of in process research and development of micrion at the date of acquisition 
in keeping with the company s policy to expense research and development costs as they are incurred  these intangible assets were written off with a charge to earnings immediately following the acquisitions 
in connection with the purchase accounting for the peo combination  the company identified four significant projects under development 
the development of three of those four projects was completed in and  with revenue recognized in late  and the fourth project was still under development at the end of and is expected to begin to generate revenue in the company s long term expectations for its markets and  accordingly  for these projects  have not changed significantly 
in connection with the purchase accounting for the micrion acquisition  the company identified four significant projects under development at the date of the acquisition 
two of those categories represent enhancements to the resolution and automation of existing products designed primarily for the semiconductor industry 
micrion  which has become a division of the company  is also enhancing the automation of its products for the data storage industry 
finally  the micrion division is continuing to develop its products for the lithography photo mask repair market 
none of the projects in these categories had been proven technologically feasible or had generated revenue as of the date of the evaluation  however  these projects are expected to begin generating revenue in because of the nature of these projects  there is always the risk that a technological hurdle may be encountered that may delay  prevent or increase the cost of development of these projects 
for additional information see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and reorganization costs 
in march  the company transferred its electroscan manufacturing activities to its manufacturing facility in eindhoven  the netherlands  and abandoned the majority of the technology acquired 
consequently  a charge to earnings of million was recognized 
the charge included million of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of the assets of electroscan  along with estimated severance costs for electroscan employees and other related costs 
in the company implemented a restructuring and reorganization program to consolidate operations  eliminate redundant facilities  reduce operating expenses  and provide for outsourcing of certain manufacturing activities 
the program was to eliminate approximately positions worldwide  or about of its work force as of july the charge of million recognized in represented the cost of providing severance  outplacement assistance  and associated benefits to affected employees  as well as moving and lease abandonment costs associated with closing duplicate facilities 
the charge of million recognized in represents the cost of relocating certain office facilities 
of this charge  million remains as a liability at december  this liability will be discharged in as the company s long term employment termination obligations are paid and as the abandoned facility leases expire 
the following table summarizes the december  status of the restructuring and reorganization costs 
years ended december  restructuring and reorganization costs charged to expense electroscan operation  worldwide restructuring and reorganization  less settled amounts   less non cash write downs  remaining cash requirements at year end   other income expense  net 
interest income for  and represents interest earned on the short term temporary investment of excess cash 
the increase in interest income in compared to is primarily the result of increased principal invested 
interest expense for the same periods represents interest incurred on borrowings under the company s bank line of credit facilities and on borrowings from philips 
interest expense generally reflects higher levels of borrowing off set by lower interest rates under the philips credit facility  as compared to the company s previous borrowings 
the increase in interest expense in compared to primarily reflects higher levels of borrowing 
in september  management reduced to zero the carrying value of its cost method investment in norsam technologies  inc norsam and  accordingly  recorded a million valuation adjustment 
management revised its projections of future cash flows that it expected to receive from this investment based on norsam s operating results and its divestiture of certain operating assets 
income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate was for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the company s effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory tax rate primarily as a result of the amortization and immediate write off of intangible assets not deductible for income tax purposes 
the effective tax rate also differs from the us federal statutory rate due to state and foreign taxes and the favorable tax effect of the company s use of a foreign sales corporation for exports from the us  among other factors 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations increased to million  higher than  and higher than  primarily due to improved operating results 
increased sales lead to a million increase in gross profit for this increase was offset by a million increase in r d and selling  general and administrative costs 
for  cash received from customers increased million over however  this increase was more than offset by increases in cash paid to suppliers and employees  which increased approximately million due to increases in inventories as well as reductions in amounts owed to those parties 
for  non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization were million combined  lower than accounts receivable increased million from to the increase was due to third and fourth quarter business combinations and higher year end shipping volumes 
similarly in  receivable levels increased significantly million in conjunction with the business combination with philips 
the business combinations also contributed to an increase in other assets  principally spare parts inventory which is not expected to be utilized within a twelve month period 
management assesses liquidity needs by evaluating cash balances on hand  available borrowings under its credit lines  working capital trends  and expected cash flows from operating activities versus its investment needs 
the company has invested both through research expenditures and through investments in business combinations to expand its position in the microelectronics business segment 
during the microelectronics segment increased its operating income to million following a loss in management believes that this segment will continue to increase in sales and operating profits and provide sufficient cash flows to warrant continued investment 
the company operates sales and service operations on a worldwide basis and transacts in numerous foreign currencies whose value in relation to the us dollar fluctuates daily 
its principal raw materials  labor  and other manufacturing costs are primarily denominated in us dollars  dutch guilders  and euros 
the company attempts to mitigate its currency translation and transaction exposures by using forward exchange contracts and by borrowing in multiple currencies 
it also negotiates the selling currency with its customers 
the mandate of the conversion to the euro in many european countries affords an opportunity to reduce the number of cross currency transactions 
the company entered into a million unsecured revolving credit agreement on february  with philips  its majority shareholder 
the agreement matures on february  it provides the company with increased borrowing capacity  replacing the million facility  which was in place during and the funds may be drawn either in the u 
s 
or offshore in a choice of three currencies 
under terms of the agreement  the company must comply with customary banking terms and conditions including financial covenants which require specific minimum equity levels and minimum cash flow to interest expense ratios 
as of december  the company was in compliance with the covenants in the agreement

as of december   borrowings under the credit facility were million  providing unused credit capacity of million 
the company also maintains a million uncommitted line of credit with a u 
s 
bank  which is utilized to support standby letters of credit  as well as certain limited credit facilities in foreign countries 
in august  in connection with the business combination with micrion  the company sold  shares to philips in a private transaction providing million in net proceeds 
the company also issues shares to fund its employee stock purchase plan which enables employees to purchase company shares at a discount to market price at fixed points in time 
the company also grants options to purchase company shares to many of its employees and directors as part of incentive and other compensation programs 
during   shares were sold or granted under these programs as compared to  shares sold or granted in  and  shares sold in during the company made several business investments in addition to ongoing investments in equipment and product development 
the largest of these investments was the august purchase of micrion corporation 
purchase consideration for this transaction  including transaction costs  consisted of cash and company shares totaling million 
in september  the company invested million to acquire a interest in a start up company  which is introducing an atomic force microscopy tool for the semiconductor industry 
in conjunction with the investment  the company entered into a distribution agreement through which it will market  sell  and service the equipment 
the company also obtained an option to purchase additional equity at a predetermined price and may make a follow on investment in the future 
during the fourth quarter of  the company acquired sales and service capabilities in a number of smaller market areas 
purchase consideration included a preliminary cash payment of million 
the company expects to continue to utilize acquisition and investment opportunities to augment its growth and market position 
the company also made capital expenditures for acquisition of equipment of million in  lower than the million invested in and lower than the million expended in these expenditures are primarily for application laboratory and demonstration systems  which exhibit the capabilities of the company s equipment to its customers and potential customers 
the lower capital spending level was in anticipation of the business combination with micrion  which added both domestic and offshore application laboratory and demonstration equipment 
capital expenditures in are expected to increase to the million to million range for this type of equipment as well as equipment used for research and development 
the company also invests in internally developed software  which controls its equipment and provides information from the equipment for use by customers 
in  capitalized amounts for internally developed software increased to million from the investment of million and the investment of million 
these expenditures are expected to continue to increase as the company introduces new products and adds new applications to its existing products 
bookings and backlog the company s backlog consists of purchase orders it has received for products and services it expects to ship and deliver within the next months 
at december  the company s product backlog was million and its field service backlog was million for a total backlog of million 
for  the company s consolidated book to bill ratio for both products and service was to at december  the company s product backlog was million and its field service backlog was million for a total backlog of million 
the company expects to ship all products representing this backlog in  although there is no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
a substantial portion of the company s backlog relates to orders for products with a relatively high average selling price 
as a result  the timing of the receipt of orders or the shipment of products could have a significant impact on the company s backlog at any date 
for this and other reasons  the amount of backlog at any date is not necessarily indicative of revenue in future periods 
year disclosure in the company began working to address year issues 
the company focused its efforts on testing and addressing deficiencies in the following areas i products  ii hardware and software of the company s manufacturing control  accounting and other information technology systems  iii identification and assessment of other third suppliers products  and iv communications with the customer base concerning year readiness of the company s products 
the company completed its efforts in these areas in the fourth quarter of with the passing of january   the company reports that no significant year problems arose 
the company did not specifically track expenditures related to its year preparedness effort  any such costs were expensed as incurred 
no further significant expenditures related to the year issue are expected 
forward looking statements from time to time the company may issue forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
the statements in this report concerning increased investment in plant and equipment and software development  the portions of the company s sales consisting of international sales  expected capital requirements  and year compliance by the company and its customers and suppliers constitute forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
factors that could materially decrease the company s investment in plant and equipment and software development include  but are not limited to  downturns in the ic manufacturing market  lower than expected customer orders and changes in product sales mix 
factors that could materially reduce the portion of the company s sales consisting of international sales include  but are not limited to  competitive factors  including increased international competition  new product offerings by competitors and price pressures  fluctuations in interest and exchange rates including changes in relevant foreign currency exchange rates between time of sale and time of payment  changes in trade policies  tariff regulations and business conditions and growth in the electronics industry and general economies  both domestic and foreign 
factors that could materially increase the company s capital requirements include  but are not limited to  receipt of a significant portion of customer orders and product shipments near the end of a quarter and the other factors listed above 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents certain unaudited financial data for each of the eight quarters in and in the opinion of management  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial information appearing elsewhere in this report and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments except for the adjustments described in the following paragraphs  necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for these periods 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
the results for the three months ended september  include the following non recurring adjustments i restructuring and reorganization costs totaling million in connection with the company s reduction in force and consolidation of duplicate facilities  ii valuation adjustment related to the company s million investment in norsam  iii inventory write offs and obsolescence reserves totaling million primarily related to the consolidation of us field service operations  iv increased warranty reserves of million reflecting the increased cost of warranty for in line fibs  and v million of product upgrade reserves reflecting the decision to replace certain third party components within the installed base of one of the company s products 
the results for the three months ended december  include restructuring and reorganization charges totaling million 
the results for the three months ended april  include restructuring and reorganization charges of million 
the results for the three months ended october  include a charge of million for estimated purchased in process research and development associated with the acquisition of micrion

net sales         cost of sales         gross profit         total operating expenses         operating income loss       other income expense  net  income loss before taxes       tax expense benefit    net income loss     net income loss per share  basic diluted shares used in per share calculation  basic         diluted         the company s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
fluctuations in operating results may be caused by a variety of factors  including the relatively high unit cost of the company s microelectronic products and electron optics products  competitive pricing pressures  conditions in the company s principal markets  the timing of orders from major customers and new product introductions  customer cancellation or delay of shipments  long sales cycles  changes in the mix of products sold and the proportion of domestic and international sales  specific feature requests by customers  product delays and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company will continue to derive a substantial portion of its revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of microelectronic products and electron optics products 
as a result  the timing of revenue recognition from a single order could have a significant impact on the company s net sales and operating results for a reporting period 
a substantial portion of the company s net sales have generally been realized near the end of each quarter and sales of electron optics products to government funded customers have generally been significantly higher in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  delays in shipments near the end of a quarter could have a substantial negative effect on operating results for that quarter 
announcements by the company or its competitors of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer purchases of the company s existing systems  which could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the impact of these and other factors on the company s sales and operating results in any future period cannot be forecast with certainty 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a large portion of the company s business is conducted outside of the united states through a number of foreign subsidiaries 
each of the foreign subsidiaries keeps its accounting records in its respective local currency 
these local currency denominated accounting records are translated at exchange rates which fluctuate up or down from period to period and consequently affect the consolidated results 
the major foreign currencies in which the company faces periodic fluctuations are the euro and the underlying european currencies  the british pound sterling  and the japanese yen 
although for each of the last three years more than of the company s sales occurred outside of the united states  a large proportion of these sales were denominated in us dollars and dutch guilders the euro in 
as a result  despite an overall strengthening of the us dollar against european currencies in  net sales were not materially affected since the impact of the strengthening of the us dollar against european currencies was fully offset by the impact of the dollar weakening against the japanese yen 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments reduced shareholders equity and comprehensive income for by million  net of tax benefit 
the company s primary exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates results from intercompany loans made between the us and dutch subsidiaries and its other foreign subsidiaries 
the company hedges its investment in a japanese subsidiary but does not otherwise actively hedge this exposure 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company does from time to time enter into forward sale or purchase contracts for foreign currencies to hedge specific sales transactions 
as of december   the aggregate notional amount of these contracts was million 
holding other variables constant  if the us dollar weakened by  the market value of foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  would decrease by approximately million 
the decrease in value would be substantially offset from the revaluation of the underlying hedged transactions 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company borrows funds under variable rate borrowing arrangements 
as of december  and during the entirety of  the company did not hedge its exposure to interest rate risk 
the company would not experience a material impact on its income before taxes as the result of a increase in the short term interest rates which are used to calculate its interest expense
