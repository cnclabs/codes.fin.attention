item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are not historical facts  and are based on current expectations  estimates  and projections about our industry  our beliefs  our assumptions  and our goals and objectives 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  and estimates  and variations of these words and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
examples of the kinds of forward looking statements in this report include statements regarding the following we believe we are a market leader  our new fab will fulfil our wafer manufacturing capacity needs  current backlog will be shipped in fiscal  and our patents may have value and may be useful for cross licensing 
these statements are only predictions  are not guarantees  of future performance  and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and other factors  some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict  and could cause actual results to differ materially form those expressed or forecasted in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include those described below in risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
risk factors semiconductor companies as a group are subject to many similar risks 
these include the risks that the demand for semiconductors decreases as the industry has historically been very cyclical  there are shortages of raw materials and or fab capacity  there are changes in underlying circuitor process technology or fab technology  or there is litigation regarding third party patents 
other factors that could affect our future results include whether we can generate new bookings from both new and current products  general economic conditions  both in the united states and foreign markets  and economic conditions specific to the semiconductor industry  risks associated with customer concentration  our ability to introduce new products  to enhance existing products  and to meet the continually changing requirements of our customers  whether we can manufacture efficiently and control costs  and our ability to maintain and enhance relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors and independent distributors and sales representatives 
in addition  we are subject to the below described risks which are specific to us and our business we have focused our product offerings primarily on niche markets which leverage our capabilities and which we believe we can dominate 
we attempt to choose markets which are sizable enough to be worth pursuing but which are not large enough to attract fierce competition 
these markets could grow enough to attract increased competition or else competitors could enter due to happenstance or down turns elsewhere 
in addition  these niches might be more susceptible to shrinkage than more diverse markets  due to their concentration on a few product offerings 
we are dependent upon one fab which we own and operate  assuming successful conversion from our four inch to our six inch fab 
we would be susceptible were this fab to be unable to meet our needs  for example  were this fab to become obsolete due to process technology changes  or to be damaged  for example by fire or earthquake 
we could encounter difficulties in operating our fab  such as contaminants in the air or defects in equipment  which could affect yields and production 
we have several competitors which are substantially larger and could bring to bear substantially more resources in our niche markets 
we have been able to maintain high margins in part because of our dominance of most of our niche markets 
increased competition could cause our margins to decrease 
our outstanding stock is owned more than by henry pao  president  ceo  and a director  and his father and brother 
they have no agreement among themselves to act together with respect to the company or their stockholdings 
were they to act in concert  they would be our largest shareholder and would have an ability to elect one or more directors  to direct management  and to delay or prevent a change in control 
we sell a substantial amount of our products internationally 
problems with foreign economies or wars  or changes in the exchange rate  could adversely affect our foreign sales 
we depend upon two customers for approximately of our sales  even though one is our primary distributor in japan and the other is a foundry customer 
customers can typically cancel or reschedule orders without penalty so decreased demand for our products could translate into decreased sales very rapidly 
we are very dependent upon continued innovation of our engineers 
the competition for engineers with relevant experience is extremely intense in the silicon valley  where most of our engineers are located 
we must compete in terms of salary  benefits  and working conditions with many start ups which can offer more equity 
we have started an ic design center in hong kong where competition is not as intense 
we are dependent upon several key persons for management and engineering expertise 
their loss would be detrimental to us 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
the following table sets forth items from the statements of income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal years ended march  net sales costs of sales research and development selling  general and administrative 
write off of acquired in process technology income from operations other income interest income other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income results of operations fiscal vs fiscal net sales the company had net sales of  in fiscal  an increase of  or from the previous fiscal year 
the increase in the current year s net sales is primarily due to the addition of the foundry business resulting from the acquisition of the submicron wafer fabrication facility fab on february  this foundry business represented of the total increase over fiscal net sales 
the remaining of the increase over fiscal net sales is due to increased sales of core products 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s net sales were derived from customers outside the united states  primarily in western europe and the far east in fiscal 
the decrease in percentage of international sales is primarily due to the acquisition and growth of the foundry business which has only us customers 
international sales represented and of net core business sales in fiscal and  respectively 
all of the company s sales to international customers were denominated in us currencies 
there was no currency exchange exposure 
gross margin the company s gross margin as a percentage of net sales was and  in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margin for the current fiscal year was adversely affected by the company incurring additional overhead expenses as a result of operating two fabs  including the depreciation of the capitalized assets and the amortization of other assets associated with the new fab 
gross margin during fiscal was also affected by lower margins associated with the foundry business resulting from the acquisition of the company s new fab 
research and development research and development expenses  which include payroll and benefits  processing costs and process transfer costs  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
dollar expenditures for research and development were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
while the dollar expenditure for fiscal is higher than the prior fiscal year  the growth in net sales caused the percentage of research and development expense to net sales to decline 
the increase in research and development expenses is due to a non recurring payment of  to orbit semiconductor  inc under a process development agreement to accelerate the process transfer of supertex s core products to the six inch fab from the old four inch fab 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  which include commissions  payroll and benefits  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the selling  general and administrative expenses was  compared to  for fiscal while the selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively the same as the previous year  the increase in net sales amount caused the percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales to decrease 
interest income interest income  which consists primarily of interest income from the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  was  in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal the decrease in interest income was caused by the decrease in cash available for investment due to the purchase of the new fab 
other income other income of  for fiscal consists primarily of gain on disposal of surplus equipment and sublease expenses net of sublease income 
the increase in this category for the fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to the gain on disposal of surplus equipment 
provision for income taxes income taxes for fiscal and were at and  respectively  of income before provision for income taxes 
the current fiscal year s tax provision is compared to a lower tax provision for fiscal higher tax credits and additional expenses from the acquisition of the six inch fab caused fiscal tax rate to be significantly lower 
fiscal vs fiscal net sales the company had net sales of  in fiscal  a decrease of  or from the previous fiscal year 
the decline in fiscal net sales reflects weakness in demand and price pressure during the first three fiscal quarters primarily as a result of the asian economic crisis 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s net sales were derived from customers outside the united states  primarily in western europe and the far east in fiscal 
all of the company s sales to international customers were denominated in us currencies 
there was no currency exchange exposure  however  during the first three quarters of fiscal when the us dollar strengthened beyond expectation  many international customers requested and received some modest price concessions 
gross margin the company s gross margin as a percentage of net sales was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in gross margin in fiscal is the result of the decline in net sales as discussed above and increased manufacturing depreciation expense partly due to the acquisition of the six inch submicron wafer fabrication facility 
research and development research and development expenses were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal is attributable primarily to the process development agreement pda that the company has with orbit semiconductor which will allow faster process transfer from the company s four inch fabrication processes to the company s newly acquired six inch submicron wafer fabrication facility 
the pda extends up to the first quarter for fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively the same as the previous year but the decline in net sales amount caused the percentage to increase less than 
write off of in process technology the company incurred a non cash  non tax deductible charge to operations of million for the write off of in process technology related to the acquisition of assets from orbit technology in february  because the technological feasibility of the in process technology acquired had not been established and there was no alternative future use 
interest income interest income  which consists primarily of interest income from the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  was  as compared with  in fiscal due to the larger amount of funds available for investment 
other income expense other income expense of  for fiscal consists primarily of royalties received from texas instruments net of tax  sublease income net of sublease expenses  and gain on disposal of retired equipment 
the decline in this category for the fiscal year when compared to fiscal was primarily due to additional sublease expenses incurred during the fiscal year  mainly depreciation in nature  as a result of a new sublease contract 
provision for income taxes income taxes for fiscal and were at and  respectively  of income before provision for income taxes 
the lower tax provision for fiscal was due to higher tax credits and additional expenses from the acquisition of the six inch facility financial condition overview total assets grew to  at the end of fiscal  up from  at the end of fiscal the increase was due primarily to profit generated from operations during the year 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of funds for fiscal   and has been the net cash generated from operating activities of   and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal of  consisted principally of net income of  plus depreciation and amortization of  provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns of  income taxes payable of  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable  deferred income taxes and inventories of   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  which consisted of increase in short term investments of  and the purchase of property and equipment of net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  which consisted of proceeds from exercises of stock options of  partially offset by repurchases of the company s common stock in the amount of  as of march   the company s working capital was  which included approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company anticipates that the available funds and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements through the end of fiscal the company expects to spend approximately  for capital acquisitions during fiscal year issues 
we reviewed and tested our internal programs and noted no issues relating to year we have not experienced any problems with our computer systems being unable to recognize appropriate dates related to year we are also not aware of any material problems with our customers or suppliers 
accordingly  we do not anticipate incurring material expenses or experiencing any material operational disruption as a result of year issues 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that all derivatives be recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position and that the corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income  depending on the type of hedging relationship that exists 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is allowed as of the beginning of any quarter beginning after issuance 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 

this interpretation has provisions that are effective on staggered dates  some of which began after december  and others that become effective after june  the adoption of this interpretation did not  and is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks due primarily to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of its investment securities 
the company has no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the investment maturities are short and the interest rates are primarily fixed 
the company anticipates interest income on cash balances for fy to be approximately  at an estimated average interest rate of
