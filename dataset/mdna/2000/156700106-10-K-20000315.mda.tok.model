inflation the effects of increased costs historically have been mitigated by the ability to recover certain costs applicable to the company s regulated telephone operations through the rate making process 
as operating expenses in the company s non regulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation  the company  to the extent permitted by competition  recovers the costs by increasing prices for its services and equipment 
while the rate making process does not permit the company to immediately recover the costs of replacing its physical plant  the company has historically been able to recapture these costs over time 
possible future regulatory changes may alter the company s ability to recover increased costs in its regulated operations 
for additional information regarding the current regulatory environment  see regulation and competition 
market risk the company is not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations since the majority of the company s long term debt obligations are fixed rate 
at december   the fair value of the company s long term debt was estimated to be billion based on the overall weighted average rate of the company s long term debt of and an overall weighted maturity of years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the company s long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of basis points in interest rates ten percent of the company s overall weighted average borrowing rate 
such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in fair value of the company s long term debt 
in early the company utilized interest rate hedge contracts to manage its interest rate risk related to the issuance of million of senior notes and debentures 
in february  the company entered into an interest rate hedge contract designed to reduce its interest rate risk with respect to million of the long term public debt that it expects to incur in connection with financing its pending acquisitions of local exchange assets in arkansas  missouri and wisconsin

although financing plans are not yet complete and will be dependent upon the company s review of its alternatives and market conditions  the company currently anticipates selling a mix of securities that will include debt securities and may include equity or equity linked securities 
currently  the company s senior unsecured debt is rated baa by moody s and bbb by standard poor s 
however  as a result of the company s announcement of its gte acquisitions  moody s placed its ratings under review for possible downgrade and standard poor s placed its ratings on creditwatch with negative implications 
the company continually evaluates the possibility of acquiring additional telecommunications operations and expects to continue its long term strategy of pursuing the acquisition of attractive communications properties in exchange for cash  securities or both 
the company generally does not announce its acquisitions until it has entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement 
over the past few years  the amount of communications properties available to be purchased by the company has increased substantially 
the company may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions  the consummation of which could have a material impact on the company s financial condition or operations 
approximately million shares of centurytel common stock and  shares of centurytel preferred stock remain available for future issuance in connection with acquisitions under an acquisition shelf registration statement 
as of december   the company s telephone subsidiaries had available for use million of commitments for long term financing from the rural utilities service and the company had million of undrawn committed bank lines of credit 
the company also has access to debt and equity capital markets  including its shelf registration statement 
the following table reflects the company s debt to total capitalization percentage and ratio of earnings to fixed charges as of and for the years ended december debt to total capitalization percentage ratio of earnings to fixed charges ratio of earnings to fixed charges excluding gain on sale or exchange of assets regulation and competition the communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory  legislative  competitive and technological changes that make it difficult to determine the form or degree of future regulation and competition affecting the company s telephone and wireless operations 
these changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies 
events affecting the communications industry in the united states congress enacted the telecommunications act of the act  which obligates lecs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the lec s network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition 
the act provides certain exemptions for rural lecs such as those operated by the company 
under the fcc s august order implementing most of the act s interconnection provisions  rural lecs have the burden of proving the availability of these exemptions 
prior to and since the enactment of the act  the fcc and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have taken steps to foster local exchange competition 
coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition has been the gradual reduction of regulatory oversight of lecs 
these cumulative changes have led to the continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with lecs services 
wireless services entities are also expected to increasingly compete with lecs 
the act authorized the establishment of new federal and state universal service funds to provide support to eligible telecommunications carriers 
these new funds are intended to replace existing federal support mechanisms that currently provide approximately of the company s consolidated revenues 
in october the fcc adopted an order implementing a new universal service support mechanism for non rural carriers for high cost and rural markets 
this order will shift non rural telephone companies to a forward looking cost model in determining their future universal service support 
because all of the company s lec s have been designated as rural telephone companies  this order will not directly impact the company 
however  this order may establish the benchmark for the treatment of universal service support funding for rural carriers 
the company s lecs will continue to receive payments under the existing federal support mechanisms for rural carriers until the fcc adopts funding support mechanisms based on forward looking economic costs  which it is required to do  but no earlier than january in september the fcc initiated a proceeding to represcribe the authorized rate of return for interstate access services provided by lecs 
the fcc periodically represcribes this rate of return to ensure that the service rates filed by incumbent lecs subject to rate of return regulation continue to be just and reasonable 
it is uncertain whether or by how much the fcc may lower the authorized rate of return 
for rate of return companies  the fcc is considering how other unresolved issues such as jurisdictional separations  access charge reform and universal service must be addressed before represcribing rate of return 
competition to provide traditional telephone or wireless services has thus far affected large urban areas to a greater extent than rural  suburban and small urban areas such as those in which the company s operations are located 
the company does not believe such competition is likely to materially affect it in the near term
