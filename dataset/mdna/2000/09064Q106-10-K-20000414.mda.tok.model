the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  without limitation  those discussed in exhibit  in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under the caption business in this annual report on form k 
overview the company was founded in to develop certain resorbable polymers for orthopaedic uses 
the company has incurred substantial operating losses since its inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
such losses have resulted to a large extent from expenses associated with the write off and reserve of impaired inventory  the development and patenting of the company s self reinforcing technologies and resorbable implant designs  preclinical and clinical studies  preparation of submissions to the fda and foreign regulatory agencies  the development of sales  marketing and distribution channels  the write off of acquired in process research and development and the development of the company s manufacturing capabilities 
after recording profitable results for a number of quarters  the company has again recorded losses in recent periods  including a loss of approximately million in although the company s revenues grew significantly in the second half of and during and  there was no revenue growth during no assurance can be given that revenues will grow in the future or that revenues will exceed expenses 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully commercialize its products or that the company will be profitable again 
in late  the company entered into an expansion phase building inventory levels and personnel in anticipation of continued growth in its core business and the introduction of new products in the craniofacial surgical market 
actual sales results were substantially less than planned  thus these increased expenditures  together with legal costs incurred to protect the company s intellectual property and a year over year vs reduction is sales resulted in operating losses during of approximately million 
the company incurred losses of  and  in the first and second quarters of during the second quarter of  the company began to implement initiatives to refocus its business and reallocate critical resources with a goal of achieving sales growth  profit improvement and a positive cash flow position 
management initiatives included development and implementation of a management restructuring plan that included adding critical resources in areas that will have the greatest impact on sales growth and profit improvement  consolidation of sales efforts for craniofacial and orthopedic products designed to improve sales efficiencies  increase market coverage and reduce the company s cost of sales  reduction in sales administration to reduce the company s overall selling costs  refocus of r d investments on new product introductions that will provide complementary product offerings for orthopedic and craniofacial products  consolidation of global inventories to reduce the company s overall investment in inventories and improve customer service levels  reduction in inventory levels to improve inventory turn rates thereby reducing the company s cash requirements to support inventory investments  increases in sales and marketing efforts designed to expand sales contributions from markets outside of the us  and the implementation of surgeon educational programs designed to increase surgeon awareness and use of the company s products 
in addition to these initiatives  during the second quarter of  four new patents were issued for the application of the company s technology for orthopedic indications 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company continued to implement these initiatives and refocus its business in an attempt to improve its profitability and operations performance 
four new products were introduced 
the loss from operations excluding the special inventory charges  increased reserves and litigation costs  has been reduced from  in the second quarter to  in the third quarter and  in the fourth quarter at december  the company s cash and cash equivalents improved from million at september  to million at december   representing the improvements made in cash flow management and our continued efforts to achieve a positive cash flow during no assurances can be given that the company s initiatives will result in profitable operations in the future 
the company first introduced its pga pins in and its pga screws in in  the company introduced its first plla products  plla pins 
plla screws were introduced in since the introduction of these products  the company has expanded its pga and plla pin and screw product lines to address additional clinical indications 
the company s pga membrane product was introduced in  and  in  the company launched its meniscus arrow  plla tacks  and pga and plla urology stents 
in  the company launched its cranio facial product line 
prior to  the company derived substantially all of its revenue from sales of its plla and pga screws and pins 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues and revenue growth in the second half of and during and resulted from sales of the meniscus arrow  which received fda clearance in march to date  all products sold by the company have been launched first in international markets 
during  and  international product sales represented approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total product sales 
see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company typically sells  consigns or provides free of charge to hospitals implant grade  stainless steel surgical instruments for use with each of its self reinforced  resorbable products 
the sale of these instruments result in margins which are typically lower than the margins applicable to the company s implant products 
for financial statement purposes  revenues from the sale of instrumentation systems are included within product sales and costs associated with such systems are included within cost of goods sold 
however  due to increased competitive activity in the hospital setting  the company began expensing instruments during the fourth quarter as they are placed in hospitals for use by the surgeon 
in the case of consigned product to distributors and dealers  the company amortizes the cost of the instrumentation over a three to four year period as cost of goods sold 
sales and loans of such systems are likely to be most pronounced in periods shortly after product launches and likely to be less prevalent as penetration of the market increases over the long term 
for information regarding the company s instrumentation practices  see business products instrumentation 
the company sells its products through managed networks of direct sales agents  independent sales agents  distributors and dealers 
in the us  the company handles all invoicing functions directly and pays commissions to its sales agents or representatives 
outside the us  the company sells its products directly to distributors and dealers at discounts that vary by product and by market 
accordingly  the company s us sales result in higher gross margins than international sales 
outside of the orthopaedic market  the company may seek to establish licensing or distribution agreements with strategic partners to develop certain products and to market and distribute products that the company elects not to distribute through its managed networks of independent sales agents  distributors and dealers 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to enter into license arrangements on satisfactory terms 
the company has entered into agreements pursuant to which the company is obligated to pay royalties based on net sales of certain of the company s products  including the meniscus arrow 
to the extent that sales of the meniscus arrow products and other licensed products increase in future periods  the company s license obligations are expected to increase 
the company invoices more than of its consolidated revenues in us dollars 
approximately of the expenses incurred by the company are denominated in us dollars 
the remaining portion of revenues and expenses are denominated in european currencies  predominantly finnish markka 
the company seeks to manage its foreign currency risk for these other currencies through the purchase of foreign currency options and forward contracts 
no assurances can be given that such hedging techniques will protect the company from exposure resulting from relative changes in the economic strength of the foreign currencies applicable to the company 
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period 
in april  the company entered into a distribution agreement with mentor corporation 
under the terms of the agreement  mentor has exclusive distribution rights for all of the company s current and future bioabsorbable stent products for urology applications in all areas of the world other than the us and japan 
in exchange for exclusive distribution rights  mentor must achieve certain minimum market penetration objectives  and pay the company a pre agreed percentage of the customer sales price on all stent products sold 
during december  the company renegotiated the agreement with mentor to include the exclusive distribution rights for the us in exchange for the us distribution rights  mentor will pay all costs and expenses associated with development  clinical and registration costs of current and future stents for urology applications on a global basis  excluding japan 
the company also entered into an agreement with toray  a japanese company  for the exclusive distribution rights for stent products in japan 
toray will pay all costs and expenses associated with development  clinical and registration costs of current and future stents for urology applications in japan 
while the company s operating losses have resulted in net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal  foreign and state income tax reporting purposes as of december   the extent to which such carryforwards are available to offset future us and finnish taxable income may be limited as a result of various ownership changes that have occurred in recent years 
additionally  because tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  the company may not be able to take full advantage of these carryforwards for income tax purposes 
furthermore  income earned by a foreign subsidiary may not be offset against operating losses of us entities 
the statutory tax rates applicable to the company and its foreign subsidiaries vary substantially 
tax rates have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s results of operations have fluctuated in the past on an annual and quarterly basis and may fluctuate significantly from period to period in the future  depending on many factors  many of which are outside of the company s control 
such factors include the timing of government approvals  the medical community s acceptance of the company s products  the success of competitive products  the ability of the company to enter into strategic alliances with corporate partners  expenses associated with patent matters  the results of regulatory inspections and the timing of expenses related to product launches 
results of operations for the years ended december   and product sales the company s product sales increased by from million in to million in  and decreased by to million in the increase in product sales in reflected continued penetration in meniscus arrow sales in the united states and increased sales of several non arrow products in both the us and international markets 
the decrease in product sales in reflected a reduction in sales of sports medicine products  including the meniscus arrow  offset to a large degree by the increase in sales of orthopedic trauma and craniofacial products 
meniscus arrow sales were negatively impacted by a reduction in the number of arrows used per surgery and the increase in non arrow sales reflects new products and market opportunities 
revenues generated from the sale of instrumentation systems and related loaner fees represented  and of total sales in  and  amounting to million in  million in and million in the decline from to in both percentage and dollar terms was primarily due to the increasingly competitive environment and a trend toward giving the instruments to healthcare institutions 
instrumentation revenues relating to the meniscus arrow during  and were approximately   and  respectively 
license and grant revenues 
license and grant revenues increased by from  in to  in and by to  in the increase in revenues from to resulted from an increase in the level of research activity during the increase in revenues from to resulted from increased government and university funding 
gross profit  gross profit margins 
the company s gross profit increased by from million in to million in and decreased by to million in the increase in the company s gross profit during primarily reflected the increased sales of meniscus arrow products after their introduction in the us in the second quarter of the decrease in includes million of special charges related to instrument and obsolete inventory  the gross profit excluding these adjustments would have been million 
overall  the company s gross profit margin increased from in to in and decreased to in excluding the special charges the gross profit margin would have decreased to in  which includes an increased amortization of instruments placed with distributors and a change in mix towards products with lower gross margins 
the company amortizes the cost of instrumentation inventory consigned to distributors and dealers  and classifies this as an inventory reserve 
the company s total amortization charge for these items increased from  at december  to  during the increase is due to a related increase in the number of instruments consigned versus the previous practice of selling the instruments 
during the fourth quarter  the company began expensing the instruments given to hospitals as their future benefit is unpredictable 
during the fourth quarter the company changed its accounting estimate for instruments consigned to hospitals 
additionally  in the fourth quarter  the company identified certain distributor accounts that had been terminated by the company and had outstanding inventory balances 
the company wrote off  of gross implant inventory and  of gross instrument that had been placed with these distributors  used as samples and or it is cost prohibitive to pursue such accounts and retrieve the products 
in the second quarter  the company recorded a charge of  for excess implant and instrument inventory due to changes in technology and the introduction of new and competing instruments 
this charge was increased by  in the fourth quarter as these continued changes in technology created excess inventory 
in aggregate  the foregoing charges resulted in a special charge of million during the net fourth quarter impact of the change in estimate for the hospital instruments was million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by from million in to million in  and by to million in such expenses were of product sales in  of product sales in  and of product sales in the increases in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses during these periods is partially attributable to salaries paid to newly employed sales persons including the costs incurred in the launch of the craniofacial products  the increase in commission payment obligations reflecting the company s increased product sales in the us  and the increase in expenses associated with establishing and supporting a managed network of independent sales agents in the us also contributing to this increase were costs incurred in connection with the company s implementation of new business initiatives related to the restructuring of the company s operations and organization to a system of managed sales agents and distributors from the aforementioned new sales employee structure  and the anticipation of new product launches 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by from  in to  in and by to  in research and development as a percentage of sales increased during this period from in to in to in these increases reflected an increased volume of product development work being performed by the company and increased staffing levels 
severance charges 
during the second quarter of  the company incurred a one time severance charge of  and incurred further charges of  during the remainder of the year related to additional employee severances 
these severance charges relate to the organizational restructuring of the company  including severance payments to the company s former chief executive officer  chief financial officer and vice president of sales 
the majority of the severance charges were paid prior to december  patent litigation 
the company has incurred million in legal fees to prosecute and in one instance settle three patent infringements suits during the patent litigation legal fees incurred during are part of the company s efforts to protect and strengthen its proprietary intellectual property position 
there were no material comparable charges in the comparable charge in was  other income and expense 
other income and expense consists of interest income and expense and miscellaneous expense and income items 
the company generated net interest income of  in   in and  in a foreign currency transaction gain of  was recorded in other income in  compared to a foreign currency transaction loss of  during and a gain of  in income taxes 
in  the company recorded an income tax provision of  or of pretax income  which primarily reflected the income generated in the company s finnish subsidiary 
in  the company recorded an income tax provision of  or of pretax income 
this increase in effective tax rate reflected the increase in income generated by the finnish subsidiary taxed at the rate of 
although an operating loss was recorded by the us entity during  no corresponding tax benefit was recognized due to the net operating loss position in the us during both the us and finnish operations had net losses with no benefit recorded 
the tax charge of  was under and represented an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset 
net income loss 
the company reported net income of  and  in and  respectively and a loss of million in recent accounting pronouncements in december  the staff of the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements  including recognition of non refundable fees received upon entering into agreements 
the company is in the process of evaluating sab and the effect it will have on our consolidated financial statements and current revenue recognition policy 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the value of those derivatives would be accounted for  depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting under sfas prospective application of sfas  as amended  is required commencing with the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after december   however  earlier application is permitted 
we do not expect the impact of sfas to be material to our financial position and results of operations 
quarterly product sales the following table presents unaudited product sales information for the quarters indicated 
in the opinion of management  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the product sales data included in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
product sales for any period are not necessarily indicative of product sales to be expected for any future period 
in thousands quarter ended march  quarter ended june  quarter ended september  quarter ended december  quarter ended march  quarter ended june  quarter ended september  quarter ended december  revenue trends will depend upon many factors  including demand and market acceptance for the company s existing and future products  the timing of regulatory approvals  the timing and results of clinical trials  the timing of the introduction of new products by the company and by competing companies  competitive sales practices  the ability of the company to enter into strategic alliances with corporate partners and the company s ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and marketing personnel 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that future revenues will not vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has relied upon bank loans  capital contributions by its principal stockholders and government grants to fund its operations 
in september  the company completed a private placement of million in preferred stock all of which was converted into common stock upon consummation of the company s initial public offering in april and warrants all of which were exercised during april 
during  the company consummated its initial public offering 
net proceeds from the initial public offering and the exercise of warrants during april were million 
in addition  the company made arrangements for a million credit line  secured by the personal property of bionx implants  inc and a subsidiary 
during this credit line was increased to million 
amounts to be advanced thereunder are subject to the lender s discretion and are limited to specific percentages of certain domestic receivables and inventory 
to date  no amounts have been borrowed pursuant to this facility 
at december  and  cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million  respectively 
the company s liquidity has been weakened substantially during the company s liquidity is dependent primarily upon its ability to improve operating results and thereby generate adequate cash flow from operations 
management has taken several steps designed to improve future financial results and reduce the amount of cash used by operations  including i developing a management restructuring plan to add critical resources to areas having the greatest impact in sales growth  ii consolidating sales efforts to improve sales efficiencies  increase market coverage and reduce selling costs  iii refocusing research and development investments on new product introductions  iv consolidating and reducing inventory levels  v increasing sales and marketing efforts outside the us  and vi where possible  reducing other operating expenses 
however  there can be no assurance that these steps will be successful 
the company s operations may not provide sufficient internally generated cash flows to meet the company s projected requirements 
the company s ability to continue to finance its operations will depend on its ability to achieve profitability by improving sales and margins  its ability to reduce cash outflows and  if necessary  its ability to obtain other sources of funding sufficient to support the company s operations 
no assurances can be given that such funding will be available on satisfactory terms or at all 
on march   the company completed a shareholder rights offering  pursuant to which it raised  before deducting expenses of approximately  and issued  shares of common stock 
the company distributed of a subscription right for each share of common stock outstanding on the january  record date for a total of  shares offered in the rights offering 
the subscription price of per share was established by the board of directors based on a discount from the market price on january   at the time the offering was priced 
the company plans to use the proceeds of the rights offering for additional working capital to fund operations  for continuing research and development and for surgeon education programs 
to the extent that funds generated from the company s operations  together with its existing capital resources  and the net interest earned thereon  are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  the company will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
the terms of any further equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and the terms of any debt financing may contain restrictive covenants  which limit the company s ability to pursue certain courses of action 
the company does not have any committed sources of additional financing beyond that described above  and there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
principal stockholders of the company who previously provided funding to the company and provided guarantees to sources of credit have indicated that they do not intend to continue furnishing such assistance 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain aspects of its operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
if adequate funds are not available  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of available capital resources will depend on numerous factors  including the company s ability to successfully perform management initiatives initiated in  market acceptance of its existing and future products  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in its product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  acquisition opportunities  progress with preclinical studies  clinical trials and product clearances by the fda and other agencies  the cost and timing of the company s efforts to expand its manufacturing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of the company s products 
the sufficiency of the company s capital reserves with respect to operations beyond will depend primarily upon the company s operating results and the extent to which such results are capable of funding anticipated growth 
the company believes that existing capital resources from its million discretionary credit line and its million rights offering completed in  together with cash flow from operations if  and to the extent  generated  will be sufficient to fund its operations during this statement constitutes a forward looking statement 
actual results could differ materially from the company s expectations regarding its capital requirements and its sources of capital 
the company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on numerous factors  including management s ability to reverse recent trends  market acceptance of the company s existing and future products  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in its product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with preclinical studies  clinical trials and product clearances by the fda and other agencies  the cost and timing of the company s efforts to expand its manufacturing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of its products 
the company s operations did not produce positive cash flows during    or to the extent that funds generated from the company s operations  together with its existing capital resources including its credit facility  and the net interest earned thereon  are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  the company will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
no assurances can be given that such funds will be made available to the company on acceptable terms or otherwise
