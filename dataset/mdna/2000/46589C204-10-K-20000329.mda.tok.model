overview of our business we develop  manufacture and market products that provide information to doctors performing minimally invasive heart  head  neck and spine  general surgical and other selected microsurgical procedures 
we have generated minimal revenues from the sales of these products since our formation in july we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for at least the next months 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately  we are not certain that our development efforts will result in commercially available products  that we will be successful in introducing the products under development  or that required regulatory approval of products will continue to be obtained in a timely manner  if at all

we had increased our staffing significantly during and to support our research and development  manufacturing scale up  service and support  sales and marketing and general and administrative activities related to new products 
in june  however  we entered into a broader distribution agreement with medtronic whereby they were to distribute our series system for cardiac surgery in the united states as well as international markets and we no longer needed a direct sales organization 
the signing of this agreement precipitated a broad restructuring of our operations which resulted in a significant downsizing of our work force from prior levels 
we expect staffing to continue to increase modestly in the near term to approximately employees and stabilize at or near that level for the balance of our fiscal year our expectation is based on the fact that significant development work on our core platform technology is now complete and on strategic decisions to partner rather than develop an independent distribution capability 
our results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales we had revenues from product sales of  for the year ended december  and revenue from product sales and distribution fees of  for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues from to was due to a reduction in sales of stereosite systems and associated distribution fees paid by sofamor danek  our distributor in the head  neck and spine market  and a reduction in sales of our series advanced visualization and information system for minimally invasive cardiac surgery during compared to these were partially offset by higher sales of oem products  including deliveries to a second oem customer in the period  by product deliveries to a second distributor for the head  neck and spine market during and by product sales to oec medical subsequently acquired by general electric for the medical imaging market during the period

we anticipate that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and product revenues  will be sufficient to fund our operations through april substantial additional capital resources will be required to fund continuing expenditures related to our research  development  manufacturing and commercialization of new products beyond that point and we estimate  in additional financing will be required to fund operations through december  we are currently engaged in an offering to raise the additional capital necessary to fund our operations  however  we may not be successful in our efforts 
in addition  certain circumstances  including slow rate of market acceptance of our products or our inability to scale up manufacturing  would accelerate our use of proceeds and require us to seek additional funds to support our operating requirements 
accordingly  we may  from time to time  seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity financings  debt financings or from other sources 
additional financing may not be available at all or that  if available  that we could obtain financing on terms acceptable to us 
should we be unable to raise sufficient funds  we may be required to curtail our operating plans and possibly relinquish rights to portions of our technology or products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our investment portfolio included fixed income securities of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate percent increase in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars and as a result have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of an immediate percent change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
