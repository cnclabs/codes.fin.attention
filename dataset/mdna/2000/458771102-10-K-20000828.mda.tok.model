these important factors include  without limitation  the assumptions  risks  and uncertainties set forth herein  as well as other assumptions  risks  uncertainties and factors disclosed elsewhere in this report and in the company s press releases  shareholders reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
company overview intermagnetics general corporation we or the company operates in four reportable operating segments electromagnetics  lts superconducting materials  refrigeration and energy technology 
the electromagnetics segment consists primarily of the manufacture and sale of magnets by the igc magnet business group and radio frequency coils by igc medical advances  inc  and the lts superconducting materials segment consists primarily of the manufacture and sale of low temperature superconducting wire and cable by igc as  all of which are used mainly in magnetic resonance imaging mri for medical diagnostics 
the majority of the company s sales in these two segments are to us and european customers 
the refrigeration segment consists of refrigeration equipment produced by two subsidiaries  igc apd cryogenics inc igc apd and igc polycold systems inc igc polycold  and refrigerants which are sold by another subsidiary  intercool energy corporation ice 
refrigeration equipment is used in the vacuum deposition industry  the semiconductor manufacturing process  mri  and in a variety of research applications 
refrigerants consist of a family of environmentally friendly refrigerants designed to replace banned cfc refrigerants 
sales of this segment are primarily to us  asian and european customers 
the energy technology segment consists primarily of the design and manufacture of high temperature superconductor hts material and the development of devices used to transmit and distribute electric power such as hts transmission cables and power transformers 
through may   the activities of the energy technology segment were included in the electromagnetics segment 
segment data for prior years has been adjusted to conform with current year presentation 
the company operates on a week fiscal year ending the last sunday during the month of may 
during the current fiscal year  the company decided to exit its refrigerant business  because the business did not fit the company s strategic direction  and has developed an exit plan 
under this plan  which is expected to be completed within months  the company terminated all but two employees and is continuing the business through a master distributor while attempting to find a buyer for the business 
as a result of this exit plan  we recorded a restructuring charge of million  including million of inventory write offs during the year 
in the previous fiscal year  we discontinued our field effects division which had been engaged in the manufacture and sale of clinical mri systems 
we recorded a total restructuring charge of million  including inventory write offs of million in connection with the closure  of which approximately million was recovered in the current year 
as of may   the company completed an agreement with alstom  sa alstom to terminate the parties joint venture  alstom intermagnetics aisa  which previously manufactured mri magnet systems under a license from the company 
as part of the agreement  aisa s magnet production is being transferred to our factory 
we paid alstom about million for certain assets  most of which related to intangible assets  including production rights 
results of operations for the year ended may   sales increased by  to million  compared with an increase of for the preceding year 
sales of the electromagnetics segment increased by million  or  due to a substantial increase in magnet system sales resulting from higher demand by the company s major customer and additional volume resulting from the purchase of aisa s production rights 
sales of rf coils declined by about million  or  due to lower sales resulting from the loss of a customer to industry consolidation and a temporary decrease in direct sales personnel 
in the prior year  electromagnetics sales were down by million due to a decline in magnet system sales of million a portion of which related to the closure of the field effects division  partially offset by a million increase in rf coil sales 
sales of lts superconducting materials were down by million in the current fiscal year due to lower demand from igc as s largest external customer 
overall segment sales  however  were up due to higher inter company demand from the electromagnetics segment 
in the prior year  overall activity was essentially unchanged as a million increase in external sales was offset by a reduction in shipments to the electromagnetics segment 
sales of refrigeration products increased by million due mainly to higher refrigerant sales 
this represents the sale of inventory in connection with the company s exit plan for the refrigerant business 
the exit plan resulted in a restructuring charge of million for the current year as described in note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
segment sales increased by million in the previous year due mainly to the inclusion of polycold systems acquired in november  for the full year 
during the current year  the company increased its emphasis on developing hts for application to devices expected to improve electric power transmission and distribution 
these devices are expected to include hts power transmission cables  transformers  and fault current controllers 
in view of the expected increased importance of these activities  the company began reporting them as a separate segment  energy technology 
in prior years  this segment s activities had been aggregated in the electromagnetics segment 
prior year segment data presented in note k of notes to consolidated financial statements has been reclassified to conform with current year presentation 
sales of this segment declined to million from million last year due to the company s decision to de emphasize first generation conductors 
the company believes  in general  that first generation conductors consisting of ceramic components in a silver matrix will be unable to achieve cost and performance targets necessary to make devices produced with this material economically feasible 
accordingly  we refocused our efforts on conductors in which the superconducting components are deposited on a nickel substrate 
we have developed important relationships and cooperative agreements for the pursuit of this approach  and we expect these to lead to an increase in sales in the coming year 
we are actively seeking additional strategic partners to assist in the development and marketing of these products 
sales in fiscal grew by about  over the previous year due to the completion of certain first generation conductor programs 
before the effects of inventory written off as a result of restructurings of million in the current year and million last year  gross margins increased to million  or of sales from million  or last year 
the improvement was largely due to the substantial increase in magnet sales in the electromagnetics segment  as well as improved margins in the refrigeration segment resulting from operating improvements begun last year in the refrigeration equipment portion of the segment 
margins in fiscal were lower than the prior year due to inventory write offs  production problems and  in certain business groups  an unfavorable sales mix 
product research and development was essentially unchanged in fiscal  and declined by in fiscal from fiscal  due to the completion of certain internal programs as well as the termination of the field effects division 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased in the current fiscal year due primarily to the settlement of a claim by a former distributor together with associated legal costs  and the fact that last year s expenses were lowered by a pension curtailment gain of million 
exclusive of those items  both years would have increased by about over fiscal  largely due to the inclusion of igc polycold which was acquired in november amortization of intangible assets increased in the current year due to intangibles acquired in connection with the termination of the aisa joint venture agreement 
operating income increased substantially during the current year due to the higher level of sales and improved gross margins 
in the prior year  before restructuring charges  operating income was essentially unchanged from fiscal in fiscal  we wrote off our investment in smis  a uk company  and provided for a million obligation for financial guarantees of that company s indebtedness 
during the current year  smis was liquidated  and the proceeds were sufficient to reduce our obligation under the guarantee to approximately  accordingly  we recorded a recovery of million in fiscal prior to the write off  the investment in smis had been recorded using the equity method of accounting 
losses included in equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates amounted to approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates also included losses recognized from application of the equity method to our investment in kryotech  a maker of computer chip cooling devices  of  in fiscal and  in fiscal we used the equity method only because our ownership interest exceeded of kryotech s equity 
during the current year  kryotech raised additional capital through an offering  and they expect to raise additional capital in the coming months 
our ownership interest was diluted and  accordingly  we have ceased applying the equity method to this investment 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared with in fiscal the reduction is largely due to higher benefit from our foreign sales corporation  and the utilization of capital loss carryforwards 
in fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million 
a major reason for the low rate of benefit was the fact that a large portion of the loss related to capital losses from the write off of our investment in smis 
because these losses can only be used to offset capital gains  the benefits are only recognized when and if capital gains are generated 
looking forward  we expect higher sales and earnings in fiscal based on expected increases in electromagnetics and refrigeration segment sales 
as previously noted  both the electromagnetics and refrigeration segments had an increase in gross margin for the year 
the refrigeration segment attained profitability during the fourth quarter  and we expect it to continue 
we also believe that we will be able to continue and expand the gains in gross margins achieved in fiscal we expect to devote a portion of this increase to internal research and development efforts  particularly in the energy technology segment  but we believe that earnings will continue to grow at a faster rate than sales 
these expectations are based on the following assumptions  among others o the market for mri systems continues to grow  o we are able to reverse the decline in rf coil sales  o current order trends for mri magnets and refrigeration equipment continue  and o reductions in production costs in all business segments continue 
year our information technology systems and facilities successfully completed the transition to the year with no adverse or negative impacts associated with the processing of date sensitive systems and equipment 
we continue to evaluate the year compliance of our business systems  facilities and significant vendors  but we believe that the risk of significant problems is small 
we spent about million on our total year readiness activities which was expensed as incurred 
liquidity and capital commitments we generated nearly million in cash from operating activities in the current year 
we used this cash to repay advances on our line of credit million  complete payment for the aisa termination million  and purchase property  plant and equipment million 
our total cash position improved to million from million last year 
during this year  we redeemed the preferred stock issued in connection with the fiscal acquisition of polycold 
of the million of preferred stock  million was redeemed for cash  million for a note payable in equal installments in june and june  and million for common stock 
under our share repurchase plan  we acquired  shares of treasury stock for million in fiscal   shares for million in fiscal  and  shares for million in fiscal see the consolidated statement of cash flows  located elsewhere in this report  for further details on sources and uses of cash 
on june   we entered into a non exclusive license agreement with respect to certain us and international patents related to hts materials and devices 
in connection with the agreement  we agreed to pay the licensor a lump sum fee  payable in two installments on june  and granted them warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share shares and prices adjusted for the stock dividend for holders of record on august  
the license is valid for all fields of use and does not require us to pay an ongoing royalty 
also in july   of our convertible subordinated debentures were converted into  shares of our common stock at per share 
additionally  we issued  shares of common stock valued at per share to induce early conversion and in lieu of all accrued interest 
the shares and prices have been adjusted for the stock dividend 
our capital and resource commitments at august consisted of capital equipment commitments of  and the million due on the previously mentioned license agreement 
we have a million unsecured line of credit with two banks 
borrowings under the line bear interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus or prime less at our option 
the line expires in november we believe we have adequate resources to meet our needs for the short term from our existing cash balances  our expected cash generation in the current fiscal year  and our line of credit 
longer term  with substantial increases in sales volume and or unusually large research and development or capital expenditure requirements to pursue new opportunities in the energy technology segment  we could need to raise additional funds 
we would expect to be able to do so through additional lines of credit  public offerings or private placements 
however  in the event funds were not available from these sources  or on acceptable terms  we would expect to manage our growth within the financing available 
inflation has not had a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk the company s exposure to market risk through derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments  such as investments in short term marketable securities and long term debt  is not material 
the financial instruments of the company that are interest rate dependent are revenue bonds issued in connection with the acquisition of certain land  building and equipment  an unsecured line of credit and a mortgage payable 
the company manages interest rates through various methods within contracts 
for the revenue bonds  the company negotiated variable rates with the option to set fixed rates 
on its mortgage payable  the company negotiated an interest rate swap agreement that  in effect  fixes the rate at 
with respect to its unsecured line of credit  the company may elect to apply interest rates to borrowings under the line which relate to either the london interbank offered rate or prime  whichever is most favorable 
see note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in response to item for more details regarding these instruments 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of changing rates on earnings and cash flow and to lower its borrowing costs 
the company does not believe that its exposure to commodity and foreign exchange risks are material
