item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of cabletron s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion below contains certain forward looking statements relating to  among other things  estimates of economic and industry conditions  sales trends  expense levels and capital expenditures 
actual results may vary from those contained in any forward looking statements 
see business environment and risk factors below 
results of operations this table sets forth the company s net sales  cost of sales  expenses by category  income loss from operations  interest income  net  other income  net  income loss before income taxes and net income loss  each expressed as percentages of net sales  for the fiscal years ended february  and february  and net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets special charges loss from operations interest income  net other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss net sales net sales for the year ended february  increased by to  million from  million for the year ended february  and compared to  million in the year ended february  sales increased primarily as a result of increased sales of the company s layer and layer switched technology products 
worldwide sales of switched products increased approximately million  or  to million in the year ended february  compared to million in the year ended february  the increase in sales of switched products was principally due to an increase in sales of the company s smartswitch router products  which offset declining sales of older switched products 
the sales increase has been as a result of the company s success in penetrating the wan segment of the layer switching market  creation of layer switching technology products and continuation of customers migrating from the older shared media technology products 
secondarily  sales increased as a result of increased sales to compaq in connection with the transition from an oem agreement between compaq and the company  with minimum purchase commitments  to an alliance agreement 
as part of this transition  compaq purchased million million in the fourth quarter of fiscal of existing inventory that was in the company s manufacturing pipeline and paid the company million as a pricing rebate for compaq s failure to meet its minimum purchase commitments in the year ended february  sales of switched products increased to million in the year ended february  compared to sales of million in the year ended february  the increase in sales of switched products was a result of increasing unit sales  primarily related to the smartswitch products 
prices per product decreased slightly for some of the older switched products during the year ended february   but shipments of new products offset this slight price decline 
the year ended february  included a full year of dnpg compaq sales  largely contributing to the increase in sales of switched products  compared to the year ended february  which included just three weeks of sales 
sales of shared media products decreased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  and sales of million in the year ended february  sales of shared media products steadily decreased throughout the years ended february  and february  as a result of both declining unit shipments and lower prices per product 
the company is evaluating its options regarding products that utilize shared media technology including exiting this line of business 
sales of other various legacy products and spectrum increased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended february  compared to million in the year ended february  this increase was largely a result of customers purchasing various legacy products that enable them to maintain their existing systems 
revenues from professional services and maintenance remained relatively flat at approximately million in the year ended february  and million in the year ended february  as a result of terminating compaq s minimum purchase commitments  the company believes that future purchases by compaq will be significantly lower than recent purchase levels 
under the alliance agreement  sales to compaq are expected to be lower than recent levels  but may result in higher direct sales to compaq s channel partners 
these revenue sources have more risk than the minimum purchase commitments which previously existed 
further  the new revenue sources are subject to execution risk in obtaining such sales 
in summary  there is a risk that as a result of terminating compaq s minimum purchase commitments  compaq s purchases of the company s products will decline substantially in the year ending march  as compared to the year ended february  this would have a materially adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
additionally  on may   the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its dnpg subsidiary 
the sale of dnpg is expected to materially reduce net sales in the year ending march  further  the discontinuation of other product lines and other actions taken in connection with the transformation are expected to decrease overall net sales in the year ending march  net sales within the united states domestic in the year ended february  were million or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales in the year ended february  and million or of net sales in the year ended february  domestic net sales increased in the year ended february  compared to the year ended february   largely due to sales of switched media products increasing by more than domestically and sales of products in the company s manufacturing pipeline to compaq 
sales decreased in the year ended february  compared to the year ended february  due to pricing competitiveness that resulted in lower prices and decreased sales of shared media products as the company transitioned to switched technology products 
net sales in europe were million or of total net sales in the year ended february  compared to million or of total net sales in the year ended february  and million or of net sales in the year ended february  the decrease in sales was a result of decreases across a majority of the product lines  including a million  or  from the year ended february  to the year ended february   decrease in shared media products and a million  or  from the year ended february  to the year ended february   decrease in sales of switched products 
sales decreased in the year ended february  compared to february  as sales of dnpg compaq products began to decline 
sales increased in the year ended february  compared to the year ended february  as the company had a full year of sales of dnpg products 
net sales in the pac rim were million or of total net sales in the year ended february  compared to million or of total net sales in the year ended february  and million or of net sales in the year ended february  sales of switched products increased million  or  from the year ended february  to the year ended february   but were offset by decreases in sales across a majority of the other product lines  including a million  or  decrease in service revenues 
sales increased in the year ended february  compared to the year ended february  as the company had a full year of dnpg compaq activity and the company placed a greater emphasis on its pac rim operations 
net sales in other regions were million  or  of total net sales in the year ended february  compared to million  or  of total net sales in the year ended february  and million  or  of net sales in the year ended february  sales increased primarily due to increased sales of switched products  which increased million  or  from the year ended february  to the year ended february  the decrease in sales during the year ended february  compared to february  was primarily due to decreased sales in latin america 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations did not have a significant impact on the company s operating results in the periods presented 
gross profit  expenses and interest income gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the year ended february  compared to million  or of net sales  in the year ended february  and compared to million  or of net sales  in the year ended february  the improvement in gross profit during the year ended february   as compared to the year ended february   reflects lower materials costs associated with streamlined product offerings 
the decrease in gross profit in the year ended february   as compared to the year ended february   as a percentage of net sales reflects the impact on pricing from increased sales to channel resellers and independent distributors  rather than selling directly to end users  and a more competitive pricing environment 
additionally  the shift from shared media to switched products resulted in higher inventory obsolescence 
in the future  the company s gross profit may be affected by the same factors as the year ended february   including the price per product sold  inventory obsolescence  the distribution channels used  price competition  the mix of products sold  the acquisition of newer products at different margins and the result of the anticipated savings recognized through its outsourcing of the manufacturing process 
research and development r d expenses in the year ended february  decreased to million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in the year ended february  and million  or of net sales  in the year ended february  r d decreased  in the year ended february  compared to the year ended february   as a result of the elimination of staff and facilities from various r d departments and refocused efforts on core projects identified in the restructuring initiative 
r d increased in the year ended february  compared to the year ended february  as a result of higher spending on the addition of software and hardware engineering personnel  directly hired and as a result of the company s acquisitions  and the associated costs related to development of new products and the next generation of existing products 
the company plans to continue emphasizing research and development as a critical strategy point 
the company plans to continue to develop new products through a combination of internal development efforts and acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that research and development efforts or acquisitions of technology will result in commercially successful new technology and products in the future  or that such technology and products will be introduced in time to meet market requirements 
the company s research and development efforts may be adversely affected by other factors discussed more fully below in business environment and risk factors 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  or of net sales  in the year ended february  compared to million  or of net sales  in the year ended february  and compared to million  or of net sales  in the year ended february  the decrease in sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales in the year ended february  compared to the year ended february   was primarily a result of reductions in sales offices and staff 
the increase in the year ended february  compared to the year ended february  was a result of an increase in sales and technical personnel  incentive payments to employees added through acquisitions and increased marketing programs 
the company expects to focus more of the future sg a expenditures on core spending  advertising and marketing to potential customers for revenue generation  and that other components of sg a will remain approximately constant  in absolute dollars  in the upcoming year 
amortization of intangible assets expenses was million  or of net sales  in the year ended february  compared to million  or of net sales  in the year ended february  and million  or of net sales  in the year ended february  the change in amortization expense was a result of acquisitions completed during the years ended february  and february  the february  amount includes a writeoff of million of goodwill related to ariel 
in the year ended february   the company recorded million of special charges for the restructuring initiative undertaken during march these charges reflect the closure of the company s manufacturing facility in ohio  the planned closure of sales offices worldwide closed through february   the consolidation and outsourcing of various manufacturing operations  the write off of certain assets that were not required subsequent to the restructuring and the planned reduction of approximately  individuals from the company s global workforce 
the reduction in the global workforce was principally manufacturing and distribution personnel but also included targeted reductions impacting most functions within the company 
the exit costs which the company expects to incur relate primarily to long term lease commitments and repayments of economic development grants resulting from the closing of the ohio facility 
this initiative was intended to reduce the expense structure of the company  reduce cost of goods sold  increase cash reserves  provide higher return on assets and revenue per employee  enable aggressive asset reduction and consolidation initiatives and increase net income 
there is no assurance that the company will achieve the intended benefits of the restructuring initiative 
the benefits are subject to numerous risks that could impair the company s ability to realize the expected benefits when expected  or ever 
in the year ended february   special charges were taken for in process research and development related to the acquisition of yago systems  inc million  ariel million  flowpoint million and netvantage million 
also in the year ended february   the company performed a physical inventory of manufacturing equipment and fixtures in preparation for the planned outsourcing of its manufacturing operations 
as a result of this physical inventory  the company wrote off approximately million of assets 
the write off consisted of equipment and fixtures that could not be located and equipment identified as idled with no future value 
in the year ended february   special charges were taken for in process research and development related to the acquisition of the dnpg million and the implementation of a realignment plan million  totaling million 
the december  realignment plan was intended to better align the company s business strategy with its focus in the enterprise and service provider markets 
the realignment was intended to better position the company to provide more solutions oriented products and service  to increase its distribution of products through third party distributors and resellers  to improve its position internationally and to aggressively develop partnership and acquisition opportunities 
the realignment included general expense reduction through the elimination of duplicate facilities  consolidation of related operations  reallocation of resources  including the elimination of certain existing projects  and personnel reduction 
during the year ended february   the company completed the reductions required to better align its global initiative 
net interest income in the year ended february  was million compared to million in the year ended february  and compared to million in the year ended february  the increase in net interest income in the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  was due to higher invested balances and generally higher interest rates 
the decrease of net interest income in the year ended february  as compared to fiscal is a result of lower cash available for short term investments caused by compaq s utilization of product credits in place of cash to settle accounts receivable and cash used to fund acquisitions 
net other income in the year ended february  was million 
of this total million relates to the gain from the sale of a subsidiary  flowpoint  million relates to the transitioning of the company s relationship with compaq and million relates to the sales of corporate equities 
income loss before income taxes income before income taxes was million in the year ended february   compared to a loss before income taxes of million in the year ended february  and a loss before income taxes of million in the year ended february  in the year ended february   the company recorded million of other income and a million restructuring charge 
in the year ended february   the company recorded special charges of million for in process research development  arising out of the acquisitions of netvantage for million  flowpoint for million  ariel for million and yago for million and a fixed asset loss of million 
in fiscal  the company recorded special charges of million  consisting of in process research and development of million in connection with the acquisition of the dnpg  and charges relating to the company s realignment of million 
the improvement from a loss before income taxes  in the year ended february   to income before income taxes  in the year ended february   was primarily due to the company s sale of its flowpoint subsidiary and income related to its restructured relationship with compaq as well as higher gross profit margins and lower operating expenses 
the increase in loss before taxes in the year ended february  was due to lower gross profit margins as the company continued its migration from shared media products to switched products and higher personnel costs in r d departments 
excluding amortization of intangible assets  other income  net and special charges  income before income taxes was million compared to loss before income taxes of million in the year ended february  and to income before income taxes of million in the year ended february  the company expects income before income taxes to decrease in the year ending on march   due to the pending sale of dnpg  the discontinuation of other product lines and other actions taken in connection with the transformation 
income tax expense benefit the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended february  compared to for the year ended february  and for the year ended february  the income tax expense was million in the year ended february  compared to an income tax benefit of million in the year ended february  and an income tax benefit of million in the year ended february  the tax expense in the year ended february  included other income items  which in total  were taxed at higher tax rates than normal operating income and expenses 
the tax benefit for the year ended february  included large non deductible in process research and development charges and acquisition costs and tax benefits related to the ariel acquisition  fixed asset loss and a loss from operations  which produced a higher tax rate than normal operating income and expenses 
the year ended february  income tax expense included a million tax charge related to the sale of flowpoint  a million tax charge related to the compaq alliance agreement  a million tax benefit related to the amortization of purchased acquisition costs  a million tax benefit related to the write off of product lines and a million tax benefit related to the manufacturing divestiture 
the year ended february  income tax benefit included a million tax benefit related to the acquisition of ariel and a million tax benefit related to the fixed asset loss 
the year ended february  income tax benefit included million related to the acquisition of the dnpg and million related to the company s realignment 
net income in the year ended february  was million compared to a net loss of million in the year ended february  and a net loss of million in the year ended february business combinations during the year ended february   the company made the strategic decision to pursue divesting itself of the manufacturing process  certain non core product lines and non core subsidiaries 
the company sold most of its manufacturing related assets and inventories to flextronics and simultaneously entered into an agreement to purchase a significant amount of its products from flextronics 
the company intends to divest itself of non core product lines and subsidiaries through selling those identified assets to a third party buyer or in some other manner that is yet to be determined 
in addition  the company has made the strategic decision to transform the company into four separate operating subsidiaries 
the company expects that by having four separate operating subsidiaries it will provide increased flexibility to better develop and implement other strategic transactions that are based on specific products or services and customer bases 
fiscal divestitures on january   the company and flextronics entered into a definitive agreement for cabletron to divest its manufacturing and repair services operations located in rochester  new hampshire and limerick  ireland to flextronics 
flextronics acquired the company s manufacturing assets  inventories and manufacturing personnel 
simultaneously with this transaction  the company contracted with flextronics as an oem to produce most of its products 
in anticipation of this divestiture  the company recorded a charge of million related to lowering its carrying value of inventory as cost of goods sold and recorded a million charge related to personnel costs as sg a expense 
the company received million for inventory that it sold to flextronics and million which reflected the net book value for manufacturing related fixed assets  including buildings 
on december   the company sold its flowpoint subsidiary to efficient networks  inc efficient in exchange for million shares of efficient common stock and  shares of efficient preferred stock 
the common stock is subject to various restrictions on resale 
the preferred stock was converted into million shares of common stock following the approval of efficient shareholders at a special meeting on april  in connection with the sale of flowpoint  cabletron and efficient entered into an oem agreement under which cabletron will resell the efficient and flowpoint product lines 
fiscal acquisitions yago systems  inc on march   cabletron acquired yago systems  inc yago  a privately held manufacturer of wire speed routing and layer switching products and solutions 
under the terms of the merger agreement  cabletron issued million shares of cabletron common stock to the shareholders of yago in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of yago  not then owned by cabletron 
prior to the closing of the acquisition  cabletron held approximately of yago s capital stock  calculated on a fully diluted basis 
cabletron also agreed  pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  to issue up to million shares of cabletron common stock to the former shareholders of yago in the event the shares originally issued in the transaction do not attain a market value of per share eighteen months after the closing of the transaction 
on september   cabletron issued approximately million shares of cabletron common stock to the former shareholders of yago  pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement 
cabletron recorded the cost of the acquisition at approximately million  including direct costs of million 
this acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
in connection with the acquisition of yago  the company allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete products 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the r d in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the company expensed these costs as of the acquisition date 
the company used independent third party appraisers to assess and allocate values to the in process research and development 
the value assigned to these assets were determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established  including development  engineering and testing activities associated with the introduction of yago s next generation switching router family of products and technologies 
at the time of its acquisition  yago was a development stage company that had spent approximately million on research and development focused on the development of advanced gigabit switching technology 
in fact  all of yago s efforts since the company s inception had been directed towards the introduction of an advanced gigabit layer  layer  and layer switching and router product family 
yago had no developed products or technology and had not generated any revenues as of its acquisition date 
at the time  yago was testing the technology related to the msr  its first product to be released  and was developing its msr family of products 
these two primary development efforts were made up of six significant research and development components  which were ongoing at the acquisition date 
these component efforts included continued msr development and testing  research and development of the msr a desktop version of the msr  development of the msr  development of wide area network interfaces for its switching products  routing software research and development  and device management software research and development 
at the time of yago s acquisition  the company believed that the msr product family of switching routers would set a new standard for performance and functionality by delivering wire speed layer  layer and layer functionality 
designed for the enterprise and isp backbone markets  upon completion of their development  the msr products were intended to offer large table capacity  a multi gigabit non blocking backplane  low latency and seamless calling 
yago also intended to develop its msr products to be interoperable with other standard based routers and switches 
as of the acquisition date  management expected the development of the msr product family would be the only mechanism to fuel yago s revenue growth and profitability in the future 
despite the incomplete state of yago s technology  the company felt that the projected size and growth of the market for the msr product  yago s demonstrated promise in the development of the msr product family and the consideration paid by cabletron s competitors to acquire companies comparable to yago all warranted the consideration paid by cabletron for yago 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  high volume verification  and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies met their design specifications including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
anticipated completion dates for the projects in progress were expected to occur over the two years following the acquisition and the company expected to begin generating the economic benefits from the technologies in the second half of funding for such projects was expected to be obtained from internally generated sources 
expenditures to complete the msr technology were expected to total approximately million over the next two years 
to date  yago s results have not differed significantly from the forecast assumptions 
yago released a fully featured msr in july the company s r d expenditures since the yago acquisition have not differed materially from expectations 
the company continues to work toward the completion of the projects underway at yago at the time of the acquisition 
most of the projects are on schedule 
the risks associated with these efforts are still considered significant and no assurance can be made that yago s upcoming products will meet market expectations 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
in the model used to value in process research and development in the yago acquisition  as of march   total revenues attributable to yago were projected to exceed million in  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d efforts 
as of the valuation date  yago had no existing products and accordingly all revenue growth in the first several years were related to the in process technologies 
the estimated revenues for the in process were projected to peak in and then decline as other new products and technologies were projected to enter the market 
cost of sales was estimated based on yago s internally generated projections and discussions with management regarding anticipated gross margin improvements 
due to the market opportunities in the gigabit ethernet arena and yago s unique product architecture substantial gross margins are expected through calendar year thereafter  gross margins are expected to gradually decline as competition increases 
cost of sales was projected to average approximately through sg a expenses including depreciation  was projected to remain constant as a percentage of sales at approximately 
r d expenditures were projected to decrease as a percentage of sales as the in process projects were completed 
r d expenditures were expected to peak in at of sales  decline  and then level out at of sales in and thereafter 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects  discount rates of to were used for the business enterprise and for the in process r d 
the company believes these rates were appropriate because they were commensurate with yago s stage of development  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and  the uncertainty of technological advances that are unknown at this time 
the forecasts used by the company in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions the company believed to be reasonable but which  at the time  were inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
at the time such forecast was made  it was uncertain whether the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  would transpire as estimated 
the company s assumptions may have been incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances are likely to occur 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from the projected results 
management expects to continue their support of these efforts and believes the company has a reasonable chance of successfully completing the r d programs 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the projects and there is no assurance that any will meet with either technological or commercial success 
the company believes as it did at the time of the yago acquisition  that if yago does not successfully complete its outstanding in process research and development efforts  cabletron s future operating results would be materially adversely impacted and the value of the in process research and development might never be realized 
dslam division of ariel corporation on september   cabletron acquired the assets and liabilities of ariel 
cabletron recorded the cost of the acquisition at approximately million  including fees  expenses and other costs related to the acquisition 
cabletron s consolidated results of operations include the operating results of the dslam division of ariel corporation from the acquisition date 
in connection with the acquisition of ariel  the company allocated million million  net of tax of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
the valuation of the in process research and development ipr d incorporated the guidance on ipr d valuation methodologies promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec 
these methodologies incorporate the notion that cash flows attributable to development efforts  including the effort to be completed on the development effort underway  and development of future versions of the product that have not yet been undertaken  should be excluded in the valuation of ipr d 
this allocation represents risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete products 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development r d in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
the company used independent third party appraisers to assess and allocate values to the in process research and development 
the value assigned to these assets was determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established  including development  engineering and testing activities associated with the introduction of ariel s next generation dslam technology

for purposes of the ipr d valuation  the total revenues attributable to ariel were projected to exceed million within years  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d efforts 
as of the valuation date  ariel had no existing products and accordingly all revenue growth in the first several years are related to the in process technologies 
for purposes of the ipr d valuation  it was estimated that revenues for the in process projects would peak in and then decline as other new products and technologies were expected to enter the market 
cost of sales was estimated based on ariel s internally generated projections and discussions with management regarding anticipated gross margin improvements 
due to the market opportunities in the network equipment arena and ariel s unique technology architecture  substantial gross margins were estimated through the forecast period 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was forecasted to decline until and then remain constant at 
sg a expenses including depreciation as a percentage of sales were projected to decline slightly until and then remain constant at 
r d expenditures as a percentage of sales were projected to remain constant at over the projection period 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects  a discount rate of was determined to be appropriate for the in process r d 
these discount rates were commensurate with ariel s stage of development  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and  the uncertainty of technological advances that were unknown at the time of acquisition 
the company believes that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined to abandon its efforts regarding dsl related technology 
the company s dsl efforts were largely a result of technology acquired in the acquisitions of ariel and flowpoint 
the company finalized its decision to abandon r d on dsl technology when it sold its flowpoint subsidiary  thus the company expensed the remainder of the ariel goodwill 
flowpoint corp 
on september   cabletron acquired flowpoint  corp  a privately held manufacturer of digital subscriber line router networking products for million  payable in four installments 
prior to the agreement  cabletron owned of the outstanding shares of flowpoint stock 
the first installment was paid in the form of cash while the remaining installments were paid in the form of cabletron common stock 
during the year ended february   the company issued approximately million shares of common stock pursuant to the installment payments 
in addition  cabletron assumed  options  valued at approximately million 
cabletron recorded the cost of the acquisition at approximately million  including direct costs of the acquisition 
cabletron s consolidated results of operations include the operating results of flowpoint  corp 
from the acquisition date 
in connection with the acquisition of flowpoint  the company recorded special charges of million for in process research and development projects 
the valuation of the ipr d incorporated the guidance on ipr d valuation methodologies promulgated by the sec

the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development is based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
for purposes of the in process r d valuation  the total revenues attributable to flowpoint were projected to exceed million within years  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d efforts 
as of the valuation date  flowpoint had a few existing products  which lacked the technological breadth and depth necessary in the evolving networking equipment market 
accordingly  for purposes of the in process r d valuation  it was estimated that significant revenue growth in the first several years would be primarily related to the in process technologies 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were projected to peak in and then decline as other new products and technologies were expected to enter the market

the company believes that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of its year ended february   the company sold its flowpoint division to efficient networks 
consequently  the company expensed the remainder of the goodwill associated with this acquisition which resulted in decreasing the realized gain from the sale of flowpoint 
netvantage  inc on september   cabletron acquired netvantage  inc  a publicly held manufacturer of ethernet workgroup switches 
under the terms of the merger agreement  cabletron issued million shares of cabletron common stock to the shareholders of netvantage in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of stock of netvantage 
cabletron recorded the cost of the acquisition at approximately million  including direct costs of the acquisition 
the cost represents million shares at per share  in addition to direct acquisition costs 
cabletron s consolidated results of operations include the operating results of netvantage  inc from the acquisition date 
in connection with the acquisition of netvantage  the company recorded special charges of million for in process research and development projects

these methodologies incorporate the notion that cash flows attributable to development efforts  including the effort to be completed on the development effort underway  and development of future versions of the product that have not yet been undertaken  should be excluded in the valuation of ipr d 
this allocation represents risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete products 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the r d in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
the company used independent third party appraisers to assess and allocate values to the in process research and development 
the values assigned to these assets were determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established  including development  engineering and testing activities associated with the introduction of netvantage s next generation ethernet technologies 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  high volume verification  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet their design specifications including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
for purposes of the ipr d valuation  the total revenues attributable to netvantage were projected to exceed million within years  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d efforts 
as of the valuation date  netvantage had a few existing products  which lacked the technological breadth and depth necessary in the evolving networking equipment market 
accordingly  it was estimated that the significant revenue growth in the first several years would be primarily related to the in process technologies 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were expected to peak in and then decline as other new products and technologies were expected to enter the market 
to date  actual revenues have been substantially similar to those projected 
cost of sales was estimated based on netvantage s internally generated projections and discussions with management regarding anticipated gross margin improvements 
due to the market opportunities in the network equipment arena and netvantage s unique technology architecture  substantial gross margins were projected through the forecast period 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was forecasted to remain constant at 
sg a expenses including depreciation as a percentage of sales was projected to decline slightly in and then remain constant at 
r d expenditures as a percentage of sales were projected to decline slightly in and remain constant at over the projection period 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects  a discount rate of was determined to be appropriate for the in process r d 
these discount rates are commensurate with netvantage s stage of development  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and  the uncertainty of technological advances that were unknown at the time of the acquisition 
the forecasts used by the company in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions the company believed to be reasonable but which  at the time  were inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
at the time such forecasts were made  it was uncertain whether the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability 
the company s assumptions may have been incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances were likely to occur 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from the projected results 
the company believes that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from the projected results 
netvantage s in process research and development value is comprised of several significant individual on going projects 
remaining development efforts for these projects include various phases of design  development and testing 
anticipated completion dates for the projects in progress are estimated to occur over the next year 
the company began recognizing the economic benefits from the technologies in the fourth quarter of the year ended february  funding for such projects was estimated to be obtained from internally generated sources 
the estimated expenditures to complete these projects appear to be reasonable as compared to actual expenditures incurred 
these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
the company believes that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of acquisition 
the company is presently evaluating strategic options regarding the netvantage projects  including selling the entire subsidiary 
this evaluation is expected to be completed prior to june  fiscal acquisitions effective february   cabletron consummated the acquisition of certain assets of the network products group npg of digital equipment corporation 
the npg  now known as the digital network products group dnpg  develops and supplies a wide range of data networking hardware and software  including lan and wan products 
dnpg s products span a wide range of networking technologies  including ethernet  fast ethernet  fddi and atm switching technologies 
the purchase price for the acquisition was approximately million  before closing adjustments  consisting of cash  product credits and assumed liabilities as a result of the acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for by cabletron under the purchase method of accounting 
in connection with the acquisition of npg  the company allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete products 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the r d in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
the company used independent third party appraisers to assess and allocate values to the in process research and development 
the value assigned to these assets were determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established  including development  engineering and testing activities associated with the introduction of npg s next generation switch  hub  adapter  and internetworking technologies 
the incomplete projects related to switch technology included  among other efforts  the introduction of fast ethernet and oc technology into gigaswitch atm and gigaswitch fddi technologies  development of gigabit and fast ethernet modules for the vnswitch chassis  and the introduction of a new gigaswitch ethernet platform to provide gigabit ethernet technology 
in the internetworking area  the company had several significant efforts on going related to network management software products  new wireless remote access offerings  and web gateway technology 
the primary developmental efforts related to the adapter family of products involved the introduction of new atm and gigabit network interface cards 
finally  in the hub family  specific r d efforts included the introduction of atm and fast ethernet modules for the dechub and the development of advanced layer switching support for the mbps hub multiswitch 
the nature of the efforts to fully develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products  technologies  and services principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  high volume verification  and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies met their design specifications including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
anticipated completion dates for the projects in progress were expected to occur over the next one and one half years  at which time the company expected to begin generating economic benefits from the technologies 
funding for such projects was expected to be obtained from internally generated sources 
as of february   expenditures to complete these projects were expected to total approximately million for the remainder of calendar year and million in calendar year these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
in the model used to value npg s in process research and development  as of february   npg s total revenues were projected to exceed billion in  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d programs 
estimated revenue from npg s existing technologies was expected to be million in  with a rapid decline as existing processes and know how approached obsolescence 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were estimated to peak in and then decline as other new products and technologies were expected to enter the market 
in the model used to value npg s in process research and development  cost of sales was estimated based on npg s historical results and discussions with management regarding anticipated gross margin improvements 
a substantial gross margin improvement was expected in due to a restructuring of npg s cost structure 
thereafter  gradual improvements were expected due to purchasing power increases and general economies of scale 
cost of sales averaged approximately through combined sg a and r d expenses were expected to peak in at of sales  decline  and level out at approximately of sales in and remain constant thereafter 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on cost of capital calculations 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects  a discount rate of was appropriate for the business enterprise  for the existing products and technology  and for the in process r d 
these discount rates were selected to reflect npg s corporate maturity  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and  the uncertainty of technological advances that are unknown at this time 
the forecasts used by the company in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions the company believed to be reasonable but which  at that time  were inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
at the time such forecasts were made  it was uncertain whether the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability 
the company s assumptions may have been incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances were likely to occur 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from the projected results 
on may   the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the dnpg division 
the company believes  as it did at the time of the npg acquisition  that if npg did not successfully complete its outstanding in process research and development efforts  cabletron s future operating results could be materially impacted and the value of the in process research and development might never be realized 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments increased to  million at february  from million at february  the balance at february  includes  million  recorded as long term investments  related to the company s investment in efficient networks 
this amount is subject to change based on market conditions and the market value of efficient networks stock 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended february  compared to million in the year ended february  and compared to million in the year ended february  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended february  compared to the year ended february  was a result of increased focus on supply chain management and lower inventory due to the use of contract manufacturers 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended february  was a result of improved inventory controls that resulted in a reduction in inventory and improved collections from customers  which were partially offset by compaq s utilization of product credits received in the company s acquisition of the dnpg 
compaq had been allowed to use the product credits through february  to purchase certain cabletron products that were ordered under the reseller agreement 
see note notes to the consolidated financial statements included at page of this document for additional details regarding the product credits 
net cash used in investing activities increased to million in the year ended february  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in the year ended february  the increase in cash from investing activities was largely due to the company s sale of its flowpoint subsidiary 
on april   the company s board of directors authorized the company to purchase up to million of the company s outstanding shares of common stock 
the company expects to use cash as it repurchases some of its outstanding shares of common stock 
in connection with its stock repurchase program  the company may enter into various hedging transactions and derivative contracts designed to manage its cash and the costs of the program 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  were million  or days of sales outstanding  at february  compared to million at february   or days sales outstanding 
the decrease in days of sales outstanding was a result of the company s focused sales efforts through resellers and distributors 
the company has been able to monitor these relationships and has improved collection efficiency  as there are fewer resellers and distributors than end users the company shipped to during the year ended february  worldwide inventories were million at february   or days of inventory  compared to million  or days of inventory  at february  the decrease of days in inventory was due to the use of contract manufacturers and increased focus on supply chain management 
the february  balance excludes items purchased by flextronics on february  the company expects inventory levels to decrease further as it realizes the full benefit from outsourcing its manufacturing process 
during the year ended february   capital expenditures totaled million and were principally related to upgrades of computer related equipment and investments in technology to improve productivity 
during the year ended february   capital expenditures totaled million and were primarily related to upgrades of computers  computer related equipment and manufacturing equipment 
capital expenditures for the year ended february  totaled million and were primarily related to software and hardware products and upgrades of computers 
on march   the company s million revolving credit facility with chase manhattan bank  first national bank of chicago and several other lenders expired 
the company had not drawn down any money under the facility 
the company has chosen not to enter into a new revolving credit facility 
in the opinion of management  internally generated funds from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will provide adequate funds to support the company s working capital  capital expenditure requirements and stock repurchase program for the next twelve months 
business environment and risk factors the following are cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company may occasionally make forward looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of the company s future performance or statements of management s plans and objectives 
these forward looking statements may be contained in  among other things  sec filings and press releases made by the company and in oral statements made by the officers of the company 
actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
therefore  no assurances can be given that the results in such forward looking statements will be achieved 
important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ from those contained in such forward looking statements include  among others  the factors mentioned below 
transformation 
the company has announced its intentions  subject to shareholder approval at the july annual meeting of shareholders  to transform its business by creating four operating subsidiaries and transferring a portion of the company s operating assets and related liabilities to the four subsidiaries 
the company currently plans to conduct an initial public offering for each of the operating subsidiaries  followed by a distribution of the remaining shares of one or more of the subsidiaries to the company s stockholders 
in addition  the company may also consider other strategic alternatives  including the sale of one or more of the operating subsidiaries 
in connection with this transformation  the company has announced its plans to discontinue several product lines to allow each of the new subsidiaries to focus on its core competencies and next generation technologies 
the discontinuance of these products will cause the company s overall revenue to decrease 
also  the creation of four independent operating companies may lead to increases in expenses for the build up of management and administrative capacity at each subsidiary to satisfy the demands of operation as a public company 
any decrease in revenue or increase in costs associated with the transformation could adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company currently plans to realize the value of the operating subsidiaries through an initial public offering  then subsequent spin off of each or through private sales of the subsidiaries 
recently  the public market for technology stocks has experienced a significant downturn  with many such stocks suffering price declines of to or more 
trading in these stocks has become extremely volatile 
if current market conditions persist  the company may be unable or unwilling to complete initial public offerings or private sales of any of its operating subsidiaries  which may inhibit the company s ability to realize the value of its planned transformation 
the company is not obliged to complete any of these strategic transactions and no assurance can be given as to whether or when any of these strategic transactions will be approved and implemented 
for example  an initial public offering of any of the subsidiaries will depend on each of their individual performance  market conditions and similar considerations 
any distribution of the remaining shares of a subsidiary to the company s stockholders  following an initial public offering  may depend upon receipt from the internal revenue service of a ruling that such distribution will be tax free to the company s stockholders and that the transaction would qualify as a tax free reorganization or other regulatory approvals 
any such strategic transaction would only be implemented if the board of directors of the company continues to believe that it is in the best interests of each of the subsidiaries and the company s stockholders 
competition 
the data networking industry is intensely competitive and subject to increasing consolidation 
competition in the data networking industry has increased in recent periods  and cabletron expects competition to continue to increase significantly in the future from its current competitors  as well as from potential competitors that may enter cabletron s existing or future markets 
cabletron s competitors include many large domestic and foreign companies  as well as emerging companies attempting to sell products to specialized markets addressed by cabletron 
cabletron s primary competitors in the data networking industry are cisco systems  inc  lucent technologies  inc  northern telecom ltd  com corporation  extreme networks  foundry networks and juniper networks 
several large telecommunications equipment companies  including nokia corp  alcatel  ericsson and siemens have begun to compete in the data networking industry and have recently made investments in or acquired several smaller data networking companies 
companies in the data networking industry compete upon the basis of price  technology  and brand recognition 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  any or all of which could increase fluctuations in operating results and materially and adversely affect cabletron s business  financial condition  and operating results 
competitors may introduce new or enhanced products that offer greater performance or functionality than cabletron s products 
there can be no assurance that cabletron will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or enhancing its existing products or that cabletron will be able to respond effectively to technological changes  new standards or product announcements by competitors 
any failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as the data networking industry has grown and matured  customers purchasing decisions have been increasingly influenced by brand recognition 
if cabletron is unable to develop and maintain competitive brand recognition  cabletron s business may be adversely affected 
cabletron s current and potential competitors have pursued and are continuing to pursue a strategy of acquiring data networking companies possessing advanced networking technologies 
the acquisition of these companies allows cabletron s competitors to offer new products without the lengthy time delays associated with internal product development 
as a consequence  competitors are able to more quickly meet the demand for advanced networking capabilities  as well as for so called end to end networking solutions 
these acquisitions also permit potential competitors  such as telecommunications companies  who lack data networking products and technologies  to more quickly enter data networking markets 
the greater resources of the competitors engaged in these acquisitions may permit them to accelerate the development and commercialization of new competitive products and the marketing of existing competitive products to their larger installed bases 
there is significant competition among cabletron and its competitors for the acquisition of data networking companies possessing advanced technologies 
as a consequence of this competition  as well as other factors  the prices paid to acquire such companies is typically extremely high relative to the assets and sales of such companies 
the greater resources of cabletron s current and potential competitors may enable them to compete more effectively for the acquisition of such companies 
in addition to acquiring other companies  cabletron s competitors frequently invest in early stage data networking companies in order to secure access to advanced technologies under development by such companies  to enhance the ability to subsequently acquire such companies and to deter other competitors from obtaining such access or performing such acquisitions 
cabletron expects that competition will increase substantially as a result of the continuing industry consolidation 
in the past  cabletron has relied upon a combination of internal product development and partnerships with other networking vendors to broaden its product line to meet the demand for end to end enterprise wide solutions 
acquisitions of or investments in other data networking companies by cabletron s competitors may limit cabletron s access to commercially significant technologies  and thus its ability to offer products that meet its customers needs 
margin pressure 
cabletron s margins may decrease as a result of a shift in product mix toward lower margin products  increased sales through lower margin distributor and reseller sales channels  increased component costs and increased expenses  which may be necessary in future periods to meet the demands of greater competition and if the expected cost savings from outsourcing the manufacturing process does not occur 
for example  as a result of various acquisitions completed during fiscal  the company acquired products that contribute a lower gross margin than the company s core products have historically contributed 
additionally  as a result of the dnpg acquisition and other business strategy initiatives  cabletron makes a higher percentage of its sales through resellers  which reduces cabletron s margin on those sales  as well as  to a lesser extent  cabletron s overall margins 
margins in any given period may be adversely affected by additional factors 
see fluctuations in operating results 
fluctuations in operating results 
a variety of factors may cause period to period fluctuations in the operating results of cabletron 
such factors include  but are not limited to i the rate of growth of the markets for cabletron s products  ii competitive pressures  including pricing  brand and technological competition  iii availability of components  including unique integrated circuits  iv adverse effects of delays in the establishment of industry standards  including delays or reductions in customer orders  delays in new product introductions and increased expenses associated with standards compliance  v delays by cabletron in the introduction of new or enhanced products  vi changes in product mix  vii delays or reductions in customer purchases in anticipation of the introduction of new products by cabletron or its competitors and viii instability of the international markets in which cabletron sells its products 
backlog as of any particular date is not indicative of future revenue due  in part  to the possibility of order cancellations  customer requested delivery delays  shifting purchasing patterns and inventory level variability 
in particular  cabletron has been experiencing longer sales cycles for its core products as a result of the increasing dollar amount of customer orders and longer customer planning cycles 
further  cabletron has recently increased its sales to service providers 
although sales to the service provider market have grown  this market is characterized by large  and often sporadic purchases 
sales activity in this industry depends upon various factors  including the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures and the availability of funding 
a decline or delay in sales orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  operating results and financial condition 
also  cabletron has experienced back end loading of its quarterly sales  making the predictability of the quarterly results very difficult 
these factors  together with increased competition  have led to an increase in sales variability and a decrease in cabletron s ability to predict aggregate sales demand for any given period 
these factors have increased the possibility that the operating results for a quarter could be materially adversely affected by the failure to obtain or delays in obtaining a limited number of large customer orders  due  for example  to cancellations  delays or deferrals by customers 
if growth in cabletron s revenues in any quarter fails to match cabletron s expectations  its earnings and margins would be materially adversely affected 
as the company transforms its business  there can be no assurance that net sales will not decrease in future periods 
any decrease in net sales could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  cabletron may not be able to adjust expense levels to match any shortfall in revenues 
as the industry becomes more competitive and standards based  cabletron is facing greater price competition from its competitors 
if cabletron does not respond with lower production costs  pricing pressures could adversely affect future earnings 
accordingly  past results may not be indicative of future results 
there can be no assurance that the announcement or introduction of new products by cabletron or its competitors  or a change in industry standards  will not cause customers to defer or cancel purchases of cabletron s existing products  which could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the market for cabletron s products is evolving 
the rate of growth of the market and the resulting demand for cabletron s recently introduced products is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
if the market fails to grow or grows more slowly than anticipated  cabletron s business  financial condition or results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  because of the global nature of cabletron s business  a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including foreign exchange rates  political and economic factors  foreign regulators and natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on future results 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 
competition for key personnel  management structure 
during the year ended february   the company implemented a new management structure  which included the creation of new senior officer positions and the realignment of management structures 
the implementation of these new management structures and cabletron s planned transformation have required the dedication of the company s existing management resources and provided distractions from the day to day demands of running cabletron s business 
this distraction of management s attention may negatively impact the company s operating results 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key employees and management  including the president s of the four new companies 
the loss of the services of key employees could adversely affect cabletron s business  operating results or financial condition 
recruiting and retaining skilled personnel  including engineers  is highly competitive 
if cabletron cannot successfully recruit and retain skilled personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  its ability to compete may be adversely affected and it may have difficulty managing its business and meeting key objectives on time 
in addition  the company must carefully balance the growth of its employees commensurate with its anticipated sales growth 
if the company s sales growth or attrition levels vary significantly  its results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
further  cabletron s common stock price has been  and may continue to be extremely volatile 
when the cabletron common stock price is less than the exercise price of stock options granted to employees  turnover is likely to increase  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
acquisition strategy 
cabletron has addressed the need to develop new products  in part  through the acquisition of other companies and businesses 
acquisitions  such as the acquisition of netvantage  ariel  yago and the dnpg  involve numerous risks including difficulties in assimilating the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which competitors have established market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
achieving the anticipated benefits of an acquisition will depend in part upon whether the integration of the companies businesses is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the successful combination of companies in the high technology industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries 
the combination of such companies will require  among other things  integration of the companies respective product offerings and coordination of their sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
for example  during the year ended february   the company abandoned the projects associated with the dsl technology related to ariel and wrote off the remaining goodwill 
there can be no assurance that such integration will be accomplished smoothly or successfully 
the difficulties of such integration may be exacerbated by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations 
the efforts required to successfully integrate acquired companies require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily distract attention from the day to day business of cabletron 
the inability to successfully integrate the operations of acquired companies could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of cabletron 
the acquisition of early stage companies  such as netvantage  ariel and yago  poses risks in addition to those identified above 
such companies often have limited operating histories  limited or no prior sales  and may not yet have achieved profitability 
in addition  the technologies possessed by such companies are often unproven 
the development and marketing of products based upon such technologies may require the investment of substantial time and resources and  despite such investment  may not result in commercially saleable products or may not yield revenues sufficient to justify cabletron s investment 
further  aggressive competitors often undertake initiatives to attract customers and to recruit key employees of acquired companies through various incentives 
in addition to netvantage  ariel  yago and the dnpg  cabletron has stated that it will continue to explore other possible acquisitions in the future 
multiple acquisitions during a period increases the risks identified above  including in particular the difficulty of integrating the acquired businesses and the distraction of management from the day to day business activities of cabletron 
near the end of the year ended february   the company acquired certain assets of the network products group of digital equipment corporation 
with this acquisition  digital equipment corporation digital entered into a reseller agreement with the company pursuant to which digital committed to purchase from the company a minimum amount of product bearing the digital brand name 
the reseller agreement was scheduled to expire on june  on june   digital was acquired by compaq 
on may   compaq entered into an oem agreement with the company pursuant to which compaq committed to purchase from the company a minimum amount of networking product bearing the compaq brand name as well as product bearing the digital brand name 
the oem agreement contained  among other things  a pricing rebate that compensated the company for compaq purchase shortfalls 
the oem agreement was scheduled to expire on june  compaq digital accounted for approximately of cabletron s revenues in the year ended february  on september   compaq and the company agreed to terminate the oem agreement and enter into a new alliance agreement 
under the alliance agreement  the two companies intend to transition sales of legacy digital branded products from compaq and its resellers to the company 
further  the two companies have agreed to expand the relationship between the company and compaq s professional services organization and cabletron will continue to resell  and compaq is expected to continue servicing  digital branded products 
further  compaq is continuing as a reseller of cabletron branded networking hardware and cabletron s spectrum network management software 
in terminating the oem agreement  compaq agreed to pay the company approximately million  in november  as a final purchase of compaq and digital branded products in the company s manufacturing pipeline 
finally  the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its dnpg business to gores technology group  on may  if this divestiture is completed  the company will no longer sell digital branded products and as a result will have lower overall sales 
there can be no assurance that compaq will be an effective reseller of the company s products or that the volume of such purchases will not decline significantly 
a higher than expected rate of return from resellers  the company s failure to adequately manage the marketing and distribution of such products  or the loss of material resellers or a material decline in sales volume through the third party resellers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
volatility of stock price 
as is frequently the case with the stocks of high technology companies  the market price of the company s stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  increased competition  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  delays or difficulties in completing the transformation into four new companies  changes in the mix of sales channels  the timing of significant customer orders the average dollar amount of customer orders has increased in recent periods  and macroeconomic conditions generally  may have a significant impact on the market price of the stock of cabletron 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have appeared to be unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of cabletron s stock in any given period 
technological changes 
the market for networking products is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions  and therefore requires a high level of expenditures for research and development 
cabletron may be required to make significant expenditures to develop such new integrated product offerings 
there can be no assurance that customer demand for products integrating routing  switching  network management and remote access technologies will grow at the rate expected by cabletron  that cabletron will be successful in developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or product enhancements that respond to these customer demands or to evolving industry standards and technological change  that cabletron will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction  manufacture and marketing of these products especially in light of the increasing design and manufacturing complexities associated with the integration of technologies  or that its new product and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
cabletron s business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if cabletron encounters delays in developing or introducing new products or product enhancements or if such product enhancements do not gain market acceptance 
in order to maintain a competitive position  cabletron must also continue to enhance its existing products and there is no assurance that it will be able to do so 
a portion of future revenues will come from new products and services 
cabletron cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its revenues  earnings or stock price 
customer credit risk 
as cabletron s sales to emerging service providers increases  it is experiencing increased demands for customer financing and leasing solutions 
this demand is coming particularly from competitive local exchange carriers clecs and metropolitan backbone providers 
these customers typically finance significant networking infrastructure deployments through alternative forms of financing  including leasing  through the company or through third parties in which the company guarantees a significant portion of the lease to the third party 
although cabletron has programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risk  there can be no assurance that such programs will alleviate all of its credit risk 
although cabletron has not experienced significant losses due to customers failing to meet their obligations to date  such losses  if incurred  could harm the company s business and have a material adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition 
product protection and intellectual property 
cabletron s success depends in part on its proprietary technology 
cabletron attempts to protect its proprietary technology through patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and license agreements 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by cabletron in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that cabletron s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to cabletron s technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect cabletron s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
no assurance can be given that any patents issued to cabletron will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages 
although cabletron does not believe that its products infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties have asserted infringement and other claims against cabletron  and there can be no assurance that such claims will not be successful or that third parties will not assert such claims against cabletron in the future 
patents have been granted recently on fundamental technologies incorporated in cabletron s products 
since patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed by third parties which  if issued as patents  could relate to cabletron s products

actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and the share price of corporate equities 
the hedging activity of the company is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities  and the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company s investment portfolio also includes minority equity investments in some publicly traded companies  the values of which are subject to market price volatility 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains an investment portfolio consisting partly of debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities 
the securities that the company classifies as held to maturity are recorded on the balance sheet at amortized cost  which approximates market value 
unrealized gains or losses associated with these securities are not material 
the securities that the company classifies as available for sale are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax as a component of stockholders equity 
a hypothetical or basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million or million decrease  respectively approximately percent or percent  respectively in the fair market value of the securities 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company does not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the company  as a result of its global operating and financial activities  is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position

gains and losses on the contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying assets or liabilities 
at february   the company had purchased forwards with a notional value of approximately million and options with a notional value of approximately million 
a hypothetical percent appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar from february  market rates would not result in a material decrease in fair market value  earnings or cash flows 
also  any gains or losses on the contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions and consequently a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows associated with the contracts
