optical cable corporation management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition continued year the year issue will affect many computers and other electronic devices that are not programmed to properly recognize a year that begins with instead of some devices may recognize dates on or after january  as a date during the s  or may not recognize the date at all 
if not corrected  many devices could fail or create erroneous results 
since  the company has been actively assessing  planning and responding to the risks to the company created by the year issue 
in assessing the risks  the company has focused on both i its internal information technology it and non it systems  including  but not limited to  computer hardware and software  manufacturing equipment  printers  facsimile machines  and other control and accounting devices  and ii its interfaces with third parties with which the company has material relationships  such as suppliers  customers and financial institutions 
the company has completed its assessment and response planning with respect to its internal it and non it systems 
additionally  the company has substantially completed its planned remediation measures with respect to those internal systems 
the company s remediation has included updating various computer hardware and software and printers to be year compliant 
the company has also determined that the year issue will not have a material adverse affect on its manufacturing machinery 
to date  the company has expended less than  on its remediation measures and believes substantial future remediation expenditures with respect to its internal systems will not be necessary 
with respect to the company s internal systems  the company has completed its planned remediation and testing and believes the year issue will not have a material adverse affect on the company or its business 
the company does not believe contingency plans are necessary for its internal systems at this time 
the company has completed its assessment of potential year issues which may arise from failures of third parties to be year compliant 
however  many of the company s suppliers and customers are still engaged in executing their year readiness efforts and  as a result  the company cannot fully evaluate the year risks to its supply chain and its distribution channels at this time 
the company s assessment efforts included sending questionnaires to major third party suppliers and reviewing responses  and taking other steps to assess risks as deemed appropriate 
the company has not been made aware of any year issues of third parties that are expected to be unresolved prior to december  and that would have a material adverse effect on the company 
nonetheless  the company is considering contingency plans  as appropriate  including relying on raw material inventory on hand and identification of alternative suppliers 
the company will continue to monitor the year status of third parties with which it has material relationships to minimize its risk from failures of such parties to be year compliant 
the most likely worst case scenario for the company with respect to the year issue is the failure of a supplier  including an energy supplier  to be year compliant such that its supply of needed products or services to the company s manufacturing facility is interrupted temporarily 
this could result in the company not being able to produce fiber optic cable for a period of time  which in turn could result in lost sales and gross profit 
optical cable corporation management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition continued while the company believes that it is taking the necessary steps to resolve its year issues in a timely manner  there can be no assurance that the company will not have any year problems 
if any such problems occur  the company will work to solve them as quickly as possible 
at present  the company does not expect that such problems related to the company s internal it and non it systems will have a material adverse affect on its business 
the failure  however  of one or more of the company s major suppliers  customers or financial institutions to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the company
