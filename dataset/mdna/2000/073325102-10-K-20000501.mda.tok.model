item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview bea systems  inc bea or the company is a leading provider of e commerce infrastructure software for e commerce applications 
bea s products and services enable scalable and reliable e commerce applications to work seamlessly in client server  internet  and legacy environments 
bea provides transactional  messaging  and distributed object based software  as well as an industry leading java web application server  for developing and deploying these e commerce applications and for connecting e commerce applications to legacy and mainframe applications 
bea also provides component based application solutions for delivering scalable and reliable e commerce applications 
in addition to its broad software product line  bea provides complete solutions to its customers through its extensive alliance network  and a full range of services  including consulting  training  and support 
bea s revenues are derived from fees for software licenses  customer support  education and consulting services 
acquisitions 
since its inception  bea has acquired several companies and product lines  and distribution rights to product lines 
through these acquisitions  bea has added additional product lines  additional functionality to its existing products  additional direct distribution capacity and additional service capacity 
these acquisitions have resulted in significant charges to bea s operating results in the periods in which the acquisitions were completed and have added intangible assets to bea s balance sheet  the values of which are being amortized and charged to bea s operating results over periods ranging from eight to twenty quarters after completion of the acquisitions 
bea s management views the e commerce infrastructure software market as growing but that companies serving that market are consolidating  and that this consolidation presents an opportunity for bea to further expand its product lines and functionality  distribution capacity and service offerings and to add new  related lines of business 
bea anticipates that it will make additional  perhaps material  acquisitions in the future 
the timing of any such acquisitions is impossible to predict and the charges associated with any such acquisitions could materially adversely affect bea s results of operations beginning in the periods in which any such acquisitions are completed 
investment in distribution channel 
bea has been and is currently investing in building its sales capacity by aggressively hiring sales and technical sales support personnel  as well as aggressively pursuing partnerships with system platform companies  packaged application software developers  systems integrators and independent consultants  independent software tool vendors  and distributors 
this investment results in an immediate increase in expenses  especially in sales and marketing  although the return on such investment  if any  is not anticipated to occur until future periods 
product development 
in april  bea announced a project to develop and market a set of solutions for enterprise application integration and component based application development  especially in the area of electronic commerce 
these efforts were significantly expanded with the acquisition of the theory center  inc ttc in november  and the announcement of an internal development project known as project e collaborate in february bea s planned investment in these efforts may affect bea s anticipated overall financial results  particularly services revenues as a percentage of total revenues  cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues  and research and development expense as a percentage of total revenues  and may create product transition concerns in bea s customer base 
in addition  investment in these projects results in an immediate increase in expenses  especially in research and development  although the return on such investment  if any  is not anticipated to occur until future periods 
these expenses adversely affect bea s operating results in the short term and also in the long term if the anticipated benefits of such investment do not materialize 
change in sales cycles 
since mid fiscal  bea has experienced changes in sales cycles for its products 
in september  bea completed its merger with weblogic  inc weblogic  whose products tend to have a shorter sales cycle than bea products at that time 
beginning in the second half of fiscal  an increasing number of bea customers began negotiating licenses to use bea products as an architectural platform for several applications 
these architectural commitments are larger in scope and potential revenue than single project transactions 
in some cases  these architectural commitments have longer sales cycles than bea s typical transactions  both because of the customer s decision cycle in adopting an architectural platform and because of heightened corporate approval requirements for larger contracts 
in some cases  architectural commitment transactions have a shorter than usual sales cycle  in order for the customer to proceed with development of the new applications 
these contrasting changes in the sales cycles and product mix may affect bea s future quarterly revenues  revenue mix and operating results 
employer payroll taxes 
the company is subject to employer payroll taxes when employees exercise stock options 
these payroll taxes are assessed on the stock option gain  which is the difference between the common stock price on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
the tax rate varies depending upon the employees taxing jurisdiction 
because we are unable to predict how many stock options will be exercised  at what price and in which country  we are unable to predict what  if any  expense will be recorded in a future period 
results of operations the following table sets forth bea s revenues  cost of revenues  operating expenses  interest expense and net loss as a percentage of total revenues for the fiscal years ended january    and fiscal year ended january  revenues license fees services total revenues cost of revenues cost of license fees cost of services amortization of certain acquired intangible assets total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of goodwill acquisition related charges income loss from operations interest income expense and other  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss cost of license fees and cost of services are stated as a percentage of license fees and services  respectively 
revenues bea s revenues are derived from fees for software licenses  consulting and education services and customer support

license revenues 
license revenues increased percent from fiscal to fiscal and increased percent from fiscal to fiscal these increases were mainly due to continued customer and market acceptance of the company s products  expansion of the company s direct sales force  and introduction of new products and new versions of existing products 
service revenues 
service revenues increased percent from fiscal to fiscal and increased percent from fiscal to fiscal service revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal and increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the increases were primarily due to increased charges for customer support resulting from increased license sales  an increase in the types of consulting services sold by the company  and increased number of service personnel and consultants as a result of the company s increased focus on service offerings 
we expect to continue investing in our services offerings  especially consulting services 
international revenues 
international revenues accounted for million or percent of total revenues in fiscal compared with million or percent of total revenues in fiscal and million or percent in fiscal the increases were the result of expansion of the company s international sales force and the acquisition of foreign distributors 
during fiscal and  europe  middle east and africa emea experienced a and percent revenue growth  respectively 
increased revenues from emea were due to increased demand for our products in europe as well as growth of our european sales force 
asia pacific apac experienced a percent revenue growth and a percent decline in revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
increased revenues from apac in fiscal were due to increased demand for our products in asia as well as growth of our asia sales force 
decreased revenues from apac in fiscal were due to the weakening of the asian economy  which began in late fiscal cost of revenues total cost of revenues represented percent of total revenues in fiscal and  and percent in fiscal  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was due to the increase in cost of services  which carry a substantially higher cost of revenues than software licenses 
amortization charges included in cost of revenues also contributed to the increase in fiscal  due to the company s acquisition of top end from ncr corporation 
cost of licenses 
cost of licenses includes expenses related to the purchase of compact discs  costs associated with transferring the company s software to electronic media  the printing of user manuals  packaging and distribution costs as well as royalties paid to third parties 
cost of licenses represented percent  percent and percent of license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal as a percentage of license revenue was due to increased use of electronic delivery 
the increase in fiscal as a percentage of license revenue was due to increased royalties paid to third parties  primarily resulting from license agreements signed in the third quarter 
we expect cost of licenses to increase as a percentage of license revenue in fiscal because these license agreements will be in place for the full year 
cost of services 
cost of services consists primarily of salaries and benefits for consulting  education and product support personnel 
cost of services represented percent  percent and percent of service revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
cost of services as a percentage of service revenues decreased in fiscal and as a result of spreading the fixed costs associated with the support centers over a larger revenue base 
if consulting revenues increase as a percentage of service revenues  then cost of services could increase as a percentage of service revenues in fiscal amortization of certain acquired intangible assets 
the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets  consisting of developed technology  distribution rights  trademarks and tradenames  totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to intangible assets resulting from a number of strategic acquisitions  particularly the fiscal acquisition of ttc and the fiscal acquisition of top end 
in the future  amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded prior to january  is expected to total million  million  million  and million for the fiscal years ending january    and thereafter  respectively 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  benefits  sales commissions  travel and facility costs for the company s sales and marketing personnel 
these expenses also include programs aimed at increasing revenues  such as advertising  public relations  trade shows and user conferences 
sales and marketing expenses increased percent in fiscal compared with fiscal and increased percent in fiscal compared with fiscal these increases were due to increased commissions on the company s increased revenue base  the expansion of the company s direct sales force and an increase in marketing personnel and programs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal due to spreading the increased sales and marketing expenses over a greater revenue base 
the company expects to continue to invest in sales channel expansion and marketing programs to promote the company s products and brand 
accordingly  the company expects sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software engineers  contract development fees  costs of computer equipment used in software development and facilities expenses 
total expenditures for research and development increased percent in fiscal compared with fiscal and increased percent in fiscal compared with fiscal these increases were attributed to an increase in software development personnel and related expenses 
the company expects to continue to commit substantial resources to product development and engineering in future periods 
as a result  the company expects research and development expenses to continue to increase in future periods 
additionally  management intends to continue recruiting and hiring experienced software development personnel and to consider the licensing and acquisition of technologies complementary to the company s business 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include costs for the company s human resources  finance  legal  information technology  facilities and general management functions 
general and administrative expenses increased percent in fiscal compared with fiscal and increased percent in fiscal compared with fiscal the increases in general and administrative expenses were attributed to the expansion of the company s support infrastructure  including information systems and associated expenses necessary to manage the company s growth 
amortization of goodwill 
goodwill and amortization of goodwill increased in fiscal due to various acquisitions completed in fiscal and fiscal in the future  amortization of goodwill recorded prior to february  is expected to total million  million  million and million in fiscal   and thereafter  respectively 
acquisition related charges 
in connection with certain acquisitions  the company acquired and expensed the cost of a number of research projects and products that were in process on the acquisition dates  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in fiscal  acquisition related charges were related to the write off associated with the acquired in process research and development relating to the acquisition of ttc 
in fiscal  acquisition related charges were primarily related to the write off associated with the acquired in process research and development relating to the acquisition of top end 
in fiscal  acquisition related charges were related to the write off associated with the acquired in process research and development relating to the acquisition of certain products from digital equipment corporation 
in november  bea completed its merger with ttc 
this resulted in the issuance of approximately million shares of bea common stock and stock options valued at approximately million 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase with million allocated to in process technology  million to goodwill and the remaining million representing other intangible assets and liabilities assumed 
the intangibles are being amortized on a straight line basis over lives ranging from two to four years 
an independent valuation of the purchased assets was performed to assist the company in determining the fair value of each identifiable tangible and intangible asset and in allocating the purchase price among the acquired assets  including the portion of the purchase price attributed to acquired in process research and development projects 
standard valuation procedures and techniques were utilized in determining the fair value of the acquired core developed and in process technology 
core technology and in process technology were identified and valued through analysis of ttc s and bea s current development projects  their respective stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete them  their expected income generating ability  their target markets and the associated risks 
the cost approach  which includes an analysis of the cost of reproducing or replacing the asset  was the methodology utilized in valuing component technology tools and assembled workforce 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the methodology utilized in valuing in process technology  completed technology  patents and non compete agreements 
each developmental project was evaluated to determine if there were any alternative future uses 
this evaluation consisted of a specific review of each project  including the overall objectives of the project  progress toward such objectives  and uniqueness of the project 
the net after tax cash flows representing the cash flows generated by the respective core and in process technologies were then discounted to present value 
the discount was based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital for the industry 
interest expense  interest income and other  net 
interest expense was million in fiscal  compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was due to a higher average amount of outstanding borrowings  primarily due to the issuance of million convertible subordinated notes due december  notes in fiscal and premiums paid in connection with the conversion of a majority of the million convertible subordinated notes due june  notes which were outstanding for substantially all of fiscal but were issued during fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to a higher average amount of outstanding borrowings  primarily due to the issuance of the notes 
interest income and other  net was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in fiscal and was due to the investment of higher average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  generated primarily from the company s debt and equity offerings 
the company has a hedging program to minimize the effect of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses from recorded foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
this program involves the use of forward foreign exchange contracts in certain european and asian currencies 
the company does not currently hedge anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses not yet incurred 
gains losses on foreign currency transactions  which are included in interest income and other  net  were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s international operations generally consist of sales and support organizations that generate revenues and incur service costs and marketing  general and administrative expenses in local currencies 
product costs  research and development  and corporate marketing and administrative expenses are primarily incurred in us dollars 
thus  a strengthening of local currencies against the us dollar has a positive influence on international revenues translated into dollars and a negative effect on translated local costs and expenses 
a weakening of local currencies has a negative effect on translated international revenues and a positive effect on translated local costs and expenses 
bea s hedging program is intended to moderate the impact of exchange rate changes on operating results and cash flow 
provision for income taxes 
although the company has experienced operating losses to date  the company has incurred income tax expense of approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the income tax expense consists primarily of domestic minimum taxes  foreign withholding taxes and foreign income tax expense incurred as a result of local country profits 
the increase in income taxes for fiscal relative to fiscal is primarily due to an overall increase in foreign corporate income taxes and service revenues and an increase in domestic state current taxes due to the book tax differences in the amortization of acquired intangibles and the timing of revenue recognition 
the increase in income taxes for fiscal relative to fiscal is primarily due to an overall increase in foreign corporate income taxes 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
fas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the available evidence  which includes bea s historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses from prior years  the company has provided a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets to the extent they are dependent upon future taxable income for realization 
the company intends to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
a deferred tax asset has been established in fiscal to the extent of refundable us current federal income taxes payable 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of january   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  up from million at january  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily due to proceeds from the notes and cash generated from operations 
cash generated from operating activities rose to million in fiscal  compared with million generated in fiscal and million generated in fiscal investing activities consumed million in cash during fiscal  compared with million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
cash used for investing activities in fiscal was primarily for a number of strategic acquisitions amounting to million  capital expenditures of million and purchases of short term investments of million 
cash used for investing activities in fiscal was primarily for a number of strategic acquisitions amounting to million  capital expenditures of million and net sales of short term investments of million 
cash used for investing activities in fiscal was primarily for short term investment purchases of million  capital expenditures of million and million for a number of strategic acquisitions 
the company generated million from financing activities in fiscal  compared with million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the primary source of cash from financing activities in fiscal was the issuance of the million notes  net of million debt issuance costs 
the primary source of cash from financing activities in fiscal was the issuance of the million notes net of million debt issuance costs 
the main use of cash for financing activities in fiscal was for the payment in full of the million outstanding note payable to novell related to acquisition of distribution rights for tuxedo 
the primary source of cash from financing activities in fiscal was from the issuance of common and preferred stock  partially offset by payments on the company s outstanding notes payable and capital lease obligations 
as of january   the company s outstanding short and long term debt obligations were million  up from million at january  at january   the company s outstanding debt obligations consisted principally of the million of convertible notes and million of other short term and long term debt 
during fiscal  approximately million of the notes were converted into common stock 
as of march   approximately million shares of the notes were converted into common stock 
in addition  the company is committed to a total of million of lease payments under operating leases through in addition to normal operating expenses  cash requirements are anticipated for financing anticipated growth  payment of outstanding debt obligations and the acquisition or licensing of products and technologies complementary to the company s business 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to satisfy its currently anticipated cash requirements through january  however  the company expects to make additional acquisitions and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to the extent necessary to fund any such acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  at all  or on terms favorable to the company 
year compliance impact of year in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late fiscal  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company expensed approximately million during fiscal in connection with remediating its systems 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout fiscal to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly

you should consult the risk factors listed from time to time in the company s reports on forms q and k 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in our actual or anticipated quarterly revenues and operating results may cause us not to meet securities analysts or investors expectations and may result in a decline in our stock price 
although we have had significant revenue growth in recent quarters  our growth rates may not be sustainable 
if our revenues  operating results  earnings or future projections are below the levels expected by investors or securities analysts  our stock price is likely to decline 
our stock price is also subject to the volatility generally associated with internet  software and technology stocks and may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our performance 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in our future quarterly revenues and operating results as a result of many factors  including 
difficulty predicting the size and timing of customer orders 
introduction or enhancement of our products or our competitors products 
the mix of our products and services sold and mix of distribution channels 
general economic conditions  which can affect our customers capital investment levels and the length of our sales cycle 
changes in our competitors product offerings and pricing policies  and customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products and product enhancements from bea or competitors 
whether we are able to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis 
any slowdown in use of the internet for commerce 
recent hiring may prove excessive if growth rates are not maintained 
the structure  timing and integration of acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  including the theory center 
the terms and timing of financing activities 
market acceptance of our products 
the lengthy sales cycle for our products 
technological changes in computer systems and environments 
whether we are able to successfully expand our sales and marketing programs 
whether we are able to meet our customers service requirements 
costs associated with acquisitions  including the acquisition of the theory center 
the impact and duration of deteriorated economic and political conditions in asia 
loss of key personnel 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interpretations of the accounting pronouncements on software revenue recognition 
as a result of all of these factors  we believe that quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast and period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of trends or future performance 
an increasing portion of our revenues has been derived from large orders  as customers deployed our products throughout their organizations or chose to standardize on our products for their system architecture 
increases in the dollar size of individual license transactions have also increased the risk of fluctuation in future quarterly results 
if we cannot generate large customer orders  or customers delay or cancel such orders in a particular quarter  it will have a material adverse effect on our revenues and  more significantly on a percentage basis  our net income or loss in that quarter 
moreover  we typically receive and fulfill a majority of our orders within the quarter  with the substantial majority of our orders received in the last month of each fiscal quarter 
as a result  we may not learn of revenue shortfalls until late in a fiscal quarter  after it is too late to adjust expenses for that quarter 
additionally  our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenues and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
any revenue shortfall below our expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our results of operations 
further  we are subject to employer payroll taxes when our employees exercise their stock options 
the employer payroll taxes are assessed on each employee s gain  which is the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
during a particular period  these payroll taxes could be material 
these employer payroll taxes would be recorded as an expense and are assessed at tax rates that varies depending upon the employee s taxing jurisdiction in the period such options are exercised based on actual gains realized by employees 
however  because we are unable to predict how many stock options will be exercised  at what price and in which country during any particular period  we cannot predict  the amount  if any  of employer payroll expense will be recorded in a future period or the impact on our future financial results 
although we use a standard license agreement  which meets the revenue recognition criteria under current generally accepted accounting principles  we must often negotiate and revise terms and conditions of this standard agreement  particularly in larger license transactions 
negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and  in certain situations  may require us to defer recognition of revenue on the license 
in addition  while we believe that we are in compliance with statement of position  software revenues recognition  sop and sop and sop  which amend certain provisions of sop  the american institute of certified public accountants has only issued some implementation guidelines for these standards and the accounting profession is still discussing a wide range of potential interpretations 
these implementation guidelines  once finalized  could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices that could cause us to recognize lower revenue and profits 
our limited operating history and need to continue to integrate our acquisitions makes it difficult to predict our future results we were incorporated in january and therefore have a limited operating history 
we have generated revenues to date primarily from sales of bea tuxedo  a software product to which we acquired worldwide distribution rights in february  and from bea weblogic  a software product which we acquired in september  and fees for software products and services related to tuxedo and weblogic 
we have also acquired a number of businesses  technologies and products  most recently the theory center  which was acquired in november and the workflow automation corporation  which was acquired in march our limited operating history and the need to integrate a number of separate and independent business operations subject our business to numerous risks 
at january   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in addition  in connection with certain acquisitions completed prior to january   we recorded approximately million as intangible assets and goodwill 
under generally accepted accounting principles  intangible assets and goodwill are required to be amortized in future periods 
approximately million of these assets have been amortized as of january  and we expect to amortize the remaining approximately million in future periods through our fiscal year ending january  we expect to amortize million of such intangible assets and goodwill in the fiscal year ending january  a substantial portion of the million purchase price for the theory center has been recorded as intangible assets and goodwill and amortized in the fiscal year ended january  and will be amortized over future periods 
if we acquire additional businesses  products and technologies in the future  we may report additional  potentially significant expenses 
if future events cause the impairment of any intangible assets acquired in our past or future acquisitions  we may have to expense such assets sooner than we expect 
because of our limited operating history and ongoing expenses associated with our prior acquisitions  there can be no assurance that we will be profitable in any future period and recent operating results should not be considered indicative of future financial performance 
our revenues are derived primarily from two main product and services lines  and a decline in demand or prices for either could substantially adversely affect our operating results we currently derive the majority of our license and service revenues from bea tuxedo and bea weblogic and from related products and services 
although we expect these products and services to continue to account for the majority of our revenues in the immediate future  we believe that bea weblogic will become an increasingly important revenue source 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for bea tuxedo and bea weblogic  such as competition  product performance or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including developments in the internet  software or technology industry  general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or our competitors operating performance 
in addition  stock prices for bea and many other companies in the internet  technology and emerging growth sectors have experienced wide fluctuations including recent rapid rises and declines in their stock prices  that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
such factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
if we cannot successfully integrate our past and future acquisitions  our revenues may decline and expenses may increase from our inception in january  we have made several strategic acquisitions 
integration of acquired companies  divisions and products involves the assimilation of potentially conflicting operations and products  which divert the attention of our management team and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results in future quarters 
we acquired leader group  inc leader group and a business unit of penta systems technology  inc penta in the quarter ended april   ncr s top end technology in june  the entersoft systems corporation entersoft in july  weblogic  inc weblogic in september  component systems  llc in may  technology resource group  inc trg in july  avitek  inc avitek in august  and the theory center ttc in november it is possible we may not achieve any of the intended financial or strategic benefits of these transactions 
while we intend to make additional acquisitions in the future  there may not be suitable companies  divisions or products available for acquisition 
our acquisitions entail numerous risks  including the risk we will not successfully assimilate the acquired operations and products  or retain key employees of the acquired operations 
there are also risks relating to the diversion of our management s attention  and difficulties and uncertainties in our ability to maintain the key business relationships the acquired entities have established 
in addition  if we undertake future acquisitions  we may issue dilutive securities  assume or incur additional debt obligations  incur large one time expenses  and acquire intangible assets that would result in significant future amortization expense 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
recently  the financial accounting standards board fasb voted to eliminate pooling of interests accounting for acquisitions and the ability to write off in process research and development has been limited by recent pronouncements 
the effect of these changes would be to increase the portion of the purchase price for any future acquisitions that must be charged to bea s cost of revenues and operating expenses in the periods following any such acquisitions 
as a consequence  our results of operations in periods following any such acquisitions could be materially adversely affected 
although these changes would not directly affect the purchase price for any of these acquisitions  they would have the effect of increasing the reported expenses associated with any of these acquisitions 
to that extent  these changes may make it more difficult for us to acquire other companies  product lines or technologies 
the lengthy sales cycle for our products makes our revenues susceptible to substantial fluctuations our customers typically use our products to implement large  sophisticated applications that are critical to their business  and their purchases are often part of their implementation of a distributed or web based computing environment 
customers evaluating our software products face complex decisions regarding alternative approaches to the integration of enterprise applications  competitive product offerings  rapidly changing software technologies and limited internal resources due to other information systems requirements 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle for our products is lengthy and is subject to delays or cancellation over which we have little or no control 
we have experienced a significant increase in the number of million and multi million dollar license transactions 
in some cases  this has resulted in more extended customer evaluation and procurement processes  which in turn have lengthened the overall sales cycle for our products 
moreover during the second half of fiscal  an increasing number of our customers began negotiating licenses to use our enterprise application solutions as an architectural platform for several applications 
these architectural commitments are larger in scope and potential revenue than single application transactions 
in some cases  these architectural commitments also have longer sales cycles than our typical single application transactions  because of both the customer s decision cycle in adopting an architectural platform and heightened corporate approval requirements for larger contracts 
we believe general economic conditions that impact customers capital investment decisions also affect our sales cycles 
in addition  industry sources widely predicted that many corporations would stop deploying new computer systems in late and early  in order to avoid disrupting their computer systems before the year we have been informed by some of our customers that they intended to freeze deploying new computer systems in late december and early furthermore  some of our customers may have accelerated their purchases and deployments of our products in advance of these freezes 
these factors could cause an unusual fluctuation in our orders  and our revenues could be materially reduced and our operating results could be materially adversely affected  especially in the first quarter of calendar any significant change in customer buying decisions or sales cycles for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we do not effectively compete with new and existing competitors  our revenues and operating margins will decline the market for application server and integration software  and related software components and services  is highly competitive 
our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various segments of this marketplace 
these competitors include operating system vendors such as ibm  sun microsystems and database vendors such as oracle 
microsoft has released products that include certain application server functionality and has announced that it intends to include application server and integration functionality in future versions of its operating systems  including future versions of windows oracle is the primary relational database vendor offering products that are intended to serve as alternatives to our enterprise application server and integration solutions 
in addition  there are companies offering and developing application server and integration software products and related services that directly compete with products we offer 
further  software development tool vendors typically emphasize the broad versatility of their tool sets and  in some cases  offer complementary software that supports these tools and performs basic application server and integration functions 
last  internal development groups within prospective customers organizations may develop software and hardware systems that may substitute for those we offer 
a number of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than us 
our principal competitors currently include hardware vendors who bundle their own application server and integration software products  or similar products  with their computer systems and database vendors that advocate client server networks driven by the database server 
ibm and sun microsystems are the primary hardware vendors who offer a line of application server and integration solutions for its customers 
ibm s sale of application server and integration functionality along with its ibm proprietary hardware systems requires us to compete with ibm in its installed base  where ibm has certain inherent advantages due to its significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and the integration of its enterprise application server and integration functionality with its proprietary hardware and database systems 
these inherent advantages allow ibm to bundle  at a discounted price  application functionality with computer hardware and software sales 
due to these factors  if we do not differentiate our products based on functionality  interoperability with non ibm systems  performance and reliability  and establish our products as more effective solutions to customers needs our revenues and operating results will suffer 
microsoft has announced that it intends to include certain application server and integration functionality in future versions of its windows operating system 
microsoft has also introduced a product that includes certain basic application server functionality 
the bundling of competing functionality in versions of windows requires us to compete with microsoft in the windows marketplace  where microsoft has certain inherent advantages due to its significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  its greater name recognition  its substantial installed base and the integration of its application server and integration functionality with windows 
we need to differentiate our products from microsoft s based on scalability  functionality  interoperability with non microsoft platforms  performance and reliability  and need to establish our products as more effective solutions to customers needs 
we may not be able to successfully differentiate our products from those offered by microsoft  and microsoft s entry into the application server and integration market could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our current and prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
such competition could materially adversely affect our ability to sell additional software licenses and maintenance  consulting and support services on terms favorable to us 
further  competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our products and related services  which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may use our technology and trademarks  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenues and increase our costs our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
it is possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patents may not provide a competitive advantage to us 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
in particular  we have  in the past  provided certain hardware oems with access to our source code  and any unauthorized publication or proliferation of this source code could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
it is difficult for us to police unauthorized use of our products  and although we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy is a persistent problem 
effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
the protection of our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products  or design around patents and other intellectual property rights we hold 
third parties could assert that our software products and services infringe their intellectual property rights  which could expose us to increased costs and litigation it is possible that third parties could claim our current or future products infringe their rights 
any such claims  with or without merit  could cause costly litigation that could absorb significant management time  which could materially adversely effect our business  operating results and financial condition 
these types of claims might require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
if required  we may not be able to obtain such royalty or license agreements  or obtain them on terms acceptable to us  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
our international operations expose us to greater management  collections  currency  intellectual property  regulatory and other risks international revenues accounted for percent  percent and percent of our consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended january   and  respectively 
we sell our products and services through a network of branches and subsidiaries located in countries worldwide 
in addition  we also market through distributors 
we believe that our success depends upon continued expansion of our international operations 
our international business is subject to a number of risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs  greater difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer collection cycles  seasonality  potential changes in tax laws  greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property and the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business 
general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets may also impact our international revenues 
since the late summer of  a number of pacific rim countries have experienced economic  banking and currency difficulties that have led to economic downturns in those countries 
among other things  the decline in value of asian currencies  together with difficulties obtaining credit  has resulted in a decline in the purchasing power of our asian customers  which in turn has resulted in the delay of orders for our products from certain asian customers and is likely to result in further delays and  possibly the cancellation  of such orders 
we anticipate that weak asian economic conditions may continue to adversely impact our financial results 
it is difficult for us to predict the extent of the future impact of these conditions 
there can be no assurances that these factors and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international revenues and consequently on our business and consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our business will suffer we have continued to experience a period of rapid and substantial growth that has placed  and if such growth continues would continue to place  a strain on the company s administrative and operational infrastructure 
we have increased the number of our employees from employees in three offices in the united states at january  to over  employees in over offices in countries at january  our ability to manage our staff and growth effectively requires us to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
in this regard  we are currently updating our management information systems to integrate financial and other reporting among our multiple domestic and foreign offices 
in addition  we intend to continue to increase our staff worldwide and to continue to improve the financial reporting and controls for our global operations 
it is possible we will not be able to successfully implement improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and that  during the course of this implementation  we could discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
if the market for application servers  application integration and application component software does not grow as quickly as we expect  our revenues will be harmed we sell our products and services in the application server  application integration and application component markets 
these markets are emerging and are characterized by continuing technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
our success is dependent in large part on acceptance of our products by large customers with substantial legacy mainframe systems  customers establishing a presence on the web for commerce  and developers of web based commerce applications 
our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the number of companies extending their mainframe based  mission critical applications to an enterprise wide distributed computing environment and to the internet through the use of application server and integration technology 
there can be no assurance that the markets for application server and integration technology and related services will continue to grow 
if these markets fail to grow or grow more slowly than we currently anticipate  or if we experience increased competition in these markets  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
if we lose key personnel or cannot hire enough qualified personnel  it will adversely affect our ability to manage our business  develop new products and increase revenue we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel including our founders  messrs 
william t 
coleman iii and alfred s 
chuang  and other key members of management 
competition for these types of employees is intense  and it is possible that we will not be able to retain our key employees and that we will not be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining qualified candidates in the future 
as we seek to expand our global organization  the hiring of qualified sales  technical and support personnel will be difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals 
failure to attract  assimilate and retain key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our failure to maintain ongoing sales through distribution channels will result in lower revenues to date  we have sold our products principally through our direct sales force  as well as through indirect sales channels  such as computer hardware companies  packaged application software developers isvs  systems integrators and independent consultants  independent software tool vendors and distributors 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in expanding our direct sales force and in further establishing and expanding relationships with distributors  isvs  oems and systems integrators 
in particular  a significant part of our strategy is to embed our technology in products our isv customers offer 
we intend to seek distribution arrangements with additional isvs to embed our web application servers in their products 
it is possible that we will not be able to successfully expand our direct sales force or other distribution channels  secure license agreements with additional isvs on commercially reasonable terms or at all  and otherwise further develop our relationships with indirect distribution channels 
moreover  even if we succeed in these endeavors  it still may not increase our revenues 
if we invest resources in these types of expansion and our revenues do not correspondingly increase  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
we rely on informal relationships with a number of consulting and systems integration firms to enhance our sales  support  service and marketing efforts  particularly with respect to implementation and support of our products as well as lead generation and assistance in the sales process 
we will need to expand our relationships with third parties in order to support license revenue growth 
many such firms have similar  and often more established  relationships with our principal competitors 
it is possible that these and other third parties will not provide the level and quality of service required to meet the needs of our customers  that we will not be able to maintain an effective  long term relationship with these third parties  and that these third parties will not successfully meet the needs of our customers 
if we do not develop and enhance new and existing products to keep pace with technological  market and industry changes  our revenues may decline the market for our products is highly fragmented  competitive with alternative computing architectures  and characterized by continuing technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies  the emergence of new industry standards or changes in customer requirements could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  our success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products  respond to changing customer requirements and develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
it is possible that our products will not adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace and that we will not be successful in developing and marketing enhancements to our existing products or products incorporating new technology on a timely basis 
failure to develop and introduce new products  or enhancements to existing products  in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  will materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our products contain software defects  it could harm our revenues and expose us to litigation the software products we offer are internally complex and  despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects  especially when we first introduce them 
we may need to issue corrective releases of our software products to fix any defects or errors 
any defects or errors could also cause damage to our reputation  loss of revenues  product returns or order cancellations  or lack of market acceptance of our products 
accordingly  any defects or errors could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims  which could be substantial in light of customers use of such products in mission critical applications 
if a claimant brings a product liability claim against us  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products interoperate with many parts of complicated computer systems  such as mainframes  servers  personal computers  application software  databases  operating systems and data transformation software 
failure of any one of these parts could cause all or large parts of computer systems to fail 
in such circumstances  it may be difficult to determine which part failed  and it is likely that customers will bring a lawsuit against several suppliers 
even if our software is not at fault  we could suffer material expense and material diversion of management time in defending any such lawsuits 
we have a high debt balance and large interest obligations at january   we had approximately million of long term indebtedness in the form of convertible notes 
as a result of this indebtedness  we have substantial principal and interest payment obligations 
the degree to which we are leveraged could significantly harm our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  our earnings are insufficient to cover our fixed charges 
we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of interest on the notes  payment of the principal amount of the notes  payment of principal and interest on our other indebtedness  future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements 
if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of cash flow from operations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative financing 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  to make future acquisitions  to absorb adverse operating results or to fund capital expenditures or increased working capital requirements would be significantly reduced 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay the notes at maturity  we could attempt to refinance the notes  however  no assurance can be given that such a refinancing would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
any failure by us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes at maturity with respect to payments of principal or prior thereto with respect to payments of interest or required repurchases would constitute a default under the indenture and could cause a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange bea s revenue originating outside the united states was percent  percent and percent of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
international revenues from each geographic sub region were less than percent of total revenues 
international sales are made mostly from the company s foreign sales subsidiaries in the local countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arise in part from intercompany accounts in which certain costs of software development  support and product marketing incurred in the united states are charged to the company s foreign subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall financial results 
the company has a program to reduce the effect of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses from recorded foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
this program involves the use of forward foreign exchange contacts in certain european and asian currencies  principally the uk  france  germany  finland  sweden  japan and australia 
a forward foreign exchange contract obligates the company to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
each month the company marks to market the foreign exchange contracts based on the change in the foreign exchange rates with any resulting gain or losses recorded in the interest income and other  net line item 
the company does not currently hedge anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses not yet incurred 
interest rates the company invests its cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  interest bearing demand deposit accounts with financial institutions  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the us government 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are only invested in short term time deposits of the local operating bank 
the company accounts for its investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  fas 
all of the cash equivalents  short term and long term investments are treated as available for sale under fas investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  the company reduces its interest rate risk by investing its cash in instruments with short maturities 
at january  the average maturity of the company s cash equivalents and short term investments was days 
the table below presents the principal amount  related weighted average interest rates and maturities for the company s investment portfolio 
short term investments are all in fixed rate instruments
