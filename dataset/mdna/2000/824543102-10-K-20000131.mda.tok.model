item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a manufacturer of engineered products  which include blanks  stamped components and value added assemblies 
the company also designs  engineers and manufactures precision tools and dies for the automotive and other industries 
in addition  the company provides steel processing services  which include pickling hot rolled steel  slitting  edge trimming  roller leveling and cutting to length of both hot and cold rolled steel 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were generated by sales to the automotive and light truck and heavy truck industries 
the company s origins date back to when its predecessor  shiloh tool die mfg 
company  began to design and manufacture precision tools and dies 
as an outgrowth of its precision tool and die expertise  shiloh tool die mfg 
company expanded into blanking and stamping operations in the early s 
in april  shiloh industries  inc was organized as a delaware corporation to serve as a holding company for its seven operating subsidiaries  and in july completed an initial public offering of common stock 
in january  the company entered into a joint venture with rouge steel company and formed a limited liability company  shiloh of michigan  llc  to produce engineered steel blanks 
the company is an equity owner in this joint venture 
on november   the company acquired substantially all of the assets of greenfield die manufacturing corp  headquartered in canton  michigan 
greenfield die manufacturing corp 
provides a variety of value added processes  including tool and die design and build  stamping  assembly  welding  prototyping operations and mold design and manufacture 
in august  the company acquired c h design company  d b a c h die technology  headquartered in utica  michigan 
c h primarily serves the automotive industry by providing tool and die design and manufacture 
in addition  in october  the company incorporated jefferson blanking  inc and commenced operations in july on november   the company acquired mtd automotive  the automotive division of mtd products inc  headquartered in cleveland  ohio 
mtd automotive is primarily a tier i supplier and primarily serves the automotive industry by providing metal stampings and modular assemblies

plant utilization levels are very important to profitability because of the capital intensive nature of these operations 
because the company performs a number of different operations  it is not meaningful to analyze simply the total tons of steel processed 
for example  blanking and stamping involve more operational processes  from the design and manufacture of tools and dies to the production and packaging of the final product  than the company s other services and therefore generally have higher margins 
a significant portion of the company s steel processing and blanking products and services is provided to customers on a toll processing basis 
under these arrangements  the company charges a tolling fee for the operations that it performs without acquiring ownership of the steel and being burdened with the attendant costs of ownership and risk of loss 
although the proportion of tons of steel which the company uses or process that is directly owned as compared to toll processed may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on customers needs  the company estimates that of total tons used or processed in its operations  approximately in  in and in  were used or processed on a toll processing basis 
revenues from toll processing as a percent of total revenues were approximately in  in and in revenues from operations involving directly owned steel include a component of raw material cost whereas toll processing revenues do not 
consequently  toll processing generally results in lower revenue  but higher gross margin  than directly owned steel processing 
therefore  an increase in the proportion of total revenues attributable to directly owned steel processing may result in higher revenues but lower gross margins 
the company s stamping operations use more directly owned steel than its other operations 
changes in the price of scrap steel can have a significant effect on the company s results of operations because substantially all of its operations generate engineered scrap steel 
engineered scrap steel is a planned by product of our processing operations 
in addition  because only five of the company s facilities utilize directly owned steel  the company is more susceptible to changes in the price of scrap steel than changes in the price of raw material steel 
changes in the price of steel  however  also can impact the company s results of operations because raw material costs are by far the largest component of cost of sales in processing directly owned steel 
the company actively manages its exposure to changes in the price of steel  and  in most instances  passes along the rising price of steel to its customers 
at times  however  the company has been unable to do so 
the company s results of operations have been adversely affected by a large number of facility expansions and start up operations in recent periods 
operations at expanded and new facilities are typically less efficient than established operations due to the implementation of new production processes 
in addition  the company depends on customers to implement their purchase programs in a timely manner  which affects the company s ability to achieve satisfactory plant utilization rates 
when the customers fail to do so  results are negatively impacted 
in the company s experience  operations at expanded or new facilities may be adversely impacted by the above factors for several periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth income statement data of the company expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended october  revenues cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense operating income interest expense

year ended october  compared to year ended october  revenues 
revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended october  from million for the comparable period in the increase in revenues is primarily due to increased volumes in our stamping operations  increased tailor welded blanking revenue  increased tool and die sales and the inclusion of a full year of revenue at jefferson blanking 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in revenue from sales of scrap steel due to a decline in the price of scrap steel per gross ton from an average of per gross ton during fiscal compared to an average of per gross ton for fiscal revenues from the blanking and stamping operations for fiscal increased approximately from the comparable period in fiscal  while revenue from the other steel processing operations for fiscal decreased approximately from the comparable period in fiscal the percentage of revenues from directly owned steel processed was for fiscal compared to for fiscal revenues from the toll processed steel were for fiscal and for the comparable period in fiscal the increase in the percentage of revenue from directly owned steel processed of approximately was primarily due to the increase in directly owned steel processing revenue and tonnage at certain facilities during the fiscal year due to a shift in customer requirements 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the comparable period in gross margin decreased to in fiscal from for the comparable period in gross margin was negatively affected by the decrease in the average price of scrap steel per ton during fiscal in addition  gross margin was negatively affected by difficulties that the company experienced in the implementation of one very significant tool and die program which caused significant difficulties at one of our tool and die facilities which resulted in production disruptions 
finally  gross margin was negatively impacted by increased depreciation resulting from increased capital expenditures 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million for the comparable period in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  these expenses decreased slightly to for fiscal from for the comparable period in fiscal the largest component of the increase  in dollars  arose principally from the addition of corporate personnel and related benefit costs 
in addition  we incurred increased professional fees associated with personnel recruitment fees and legal fees associated with the negotiation of union contracts 
other 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million for the comparable period in fiscal due primarily to increased average borrowings during fiscal that were primarily incurred in connection with significant capital expenditures made during fiscal and fiscal interest expense of approximately million relating to expansion of several facilities was capitalized in fiscal the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  representing effective tax rates of and  respectively 
net income 
income from continuing operations for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in fiscal this decrease was substantially the result of a decline in scrap prices per gross ton  lower margins on specific tool and die projects  increased depreciation resulting from increased capital expenditures and increased interest expense resulting from increased borrowing for significant capital expenditures made during fiscal and fiscal year ended october  compared to year ended october  revenues 
revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended october  from million for the comparable period in the increase in revenues is primarily due to the inclusion in fiscal of million in revenues from c h and increased revenues resulting from new programs and increased processing capacity at sectional stamping 
in addition revenues increased at shiloh of michigan and liverpool coil processing 
revenues from the blanking and stamping operations for fiscal increased approximately from the comparable period due primarily to the inclusion of c h and increased revenue at shiloh of michigan and sectional stamping  while revenue from the other steel processing operations for fiscal increased approximately from the comparable period in fiscal due primarily to increased revenue at liverpool coil processing 
the percentage of revenues from directly owned steel processed was for fiscal compared to for fiscal revenues from the toll processed steel were for fiscal and for the comparable period in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the comparable period in gross margin decreased to in fiscal from for the comparable period in the decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to lower margins in the tool and die business  a decrease in outsourcing by major steel producing customers that impacted one of our steel processing operations  the residual effects from the gm strike and greenfield die manufacturing corp s continued challenges associated with the integration of its operations as a result of the acquisition and subsequent expansion of its facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million for the comparable period in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  these expenses decreased to for fiscal from for the comparable period in fiscal the largest component of the increase  in dollars  arose principally from the inclusion of c h 
in addition  the increase in dollars was attributable to pre operating costs of jefferson blanking 
other 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million for the comparable period in fiscal due primarily to increased average borrowings during fiscal that were primarily incurred in connection with the acquisition of c h and other capital expenditures 
interest expense of approximately million relating to expansion of several facilities was capitalized in fiscal the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  representing effective tax rates of and 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a return to a more sustainable level of state incentives for capital investments 
net income 
income from continuing operations for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in fiscal this decrease was substantially the result of lower margins in the tool and die business  lower price for scrap steel that is sold to the secondary steel industry and residual effects from the gm strike 
liquidity and capital resources at october   the company had million of working capital  representing a current ratio of to and debt to total capitalization of 
as a result of this strong financial condition  the company will be able to continue its planned investment in new equipment and facilities through the next fiscal year 
net cash provided by operating activities is primarily generated from net income of the company plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  which because of the capital intensive nature of the company s business  are substantial 
net cash provided by operating activities for was million as compared to million for the comparable period in fiscal fluctuations in working capital were the primary factors causing the decrease in net cash provided by operations from fiscal to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities has historically been used by the company to fund a portion of its capital expenditures 
capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million during the year ended october  and million during fiscal the capital expenditures made during were primarily for expansions of existing facilities of approximately million  million in new construction for the blanking facility in saltillo  mexico  as well as  an information system and sustaining capital expenditures of million 
the company s total capital budget for fiscal amounts to approximately million 
the capital expenditures in fiscal are anticipated to be primarily for facility expansions and additions  which are being made to support expected increases in existing business  anticipated new business and to enhance productivity 
in addition to using cash generated by operating activities to fund such capital expenditures  the company anticipates funding such activities through additional financing 
in september  the company entered into a new agreement the agreement with keybank  national association  as agent for a group of lenders 
the agreement provides for loans and letters of credit up to million 
the term of this facility matures in september the company has the option to select the applicable interest rate at keybank s prime rate or the libor rate plus a factor determined by a pricing matrix ranging from to for the prime rate and ranging from to for the libor rate based on funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
as of october   the factor as determined by the pricing matrix was 
the terms of the new facility also require an annual commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the facility and a factor determined by a pricing matrix ranging from to based on funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the agreement also provides for the incurrence of debt under standby letters of credit and for the advancement of funds under a discretionary line of credit 
the maximum amount of debt that may be incurred under each of these sources of funds is million 
as of october   million was outstanding under the agreement 
the agreement is collateralized by a first priority security interest in all of the company s and subsidiaries existing and after acquired accounts receivable  inventory and machinery and equipment 
all of the obligations under the agreement are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all of the existing and future domestic subsidiaries 
the agreement requires the company to meet certain financial covenants and ratios including minimum interest coverage  minimum net worth  and maximum leverage

the company executed a demand promissory note as of december  in favor of the richland bank in the aggregate principal amount of million 
interest accrues on the outstanding principal balance under that facility at libor plus in march  medina county  ohio issued on the company s behalf an aggregate of million in principal amount of variable rate industrial revenue bonds due  all of which was outstanding as of october  these bonds are secured by a letter of credit 
the funds from these bonds were used to finance a portion of the expansion at the steel pickling operations in valley city  ohio 
year the company did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in its operating or business systems when the date changed from to based on operations since january   the company does not expect any significant impact to its on going business as a result of the year issue 
however  it is possible that the full impact of the date change  which was of concern due to computer programs that use two digits instead of four digits to define years  has not been fully recognized 
for example  it is possible that year or similar issues such as leap year related problems may occur with billing  payroll  or financial closings at month  quarterly or year end 
the company believes that any such problems are likely to be minor and correctable 
in addition  the company could still be negatively impacted if its customers or suppliers are adversely affected by the year or similar issues 
the company currently is not aware of any significant year or similar problems that have arisen for its customers and suppliers 
as of october   the company spent approximately million on a new business system  however  the company cannot quantify the amount directly related to year compliance 
effect of inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the interest expense of floating rate indebtedness and by increasing the cost of labor  equipment and raw materials 
the general level of inflation has not had a material effect on the company s financial results
