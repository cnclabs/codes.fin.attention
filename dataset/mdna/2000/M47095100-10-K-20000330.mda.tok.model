impact of inflation and currency fluctuations  market risk the dollar cost of fundtech s operations in israel is influenced by the extent to which any increase in the rate of inflation in israel is or is not offset or is offset on a lagging basis by the devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
inflation in israel will have a negative effect on the profitability to fundtech of contracts under which fundtech is to receive payment in dollars or dollar linked nis while incurring expenses in nis linked to the israeli cpi  unless such inflation is offset by a devaluation of the nis

this trend was reversed during and in  the rate of inflation was and the rate of devaluation was 
in  the rate of inflation was and the rate of devaluation was 
in  israel experienced inflation at the rate of as well as a devaluation of the dollar against the nis at the rate of 
a devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar would have the effect of decreasing the dollar value of any asset of fundtech which consists of nis or receivables payable in nis unless such receivables are linked to the dollar 
such a devaluation would also have the effect of reducing the dollar amount of any expenses or liabilities of fundtech which are payable in nis unless such expenses or payables are linked to the dollar

because exchange rates between the nis and the dollar fluctuate continuously albeit with a historically declining trend in the value of the nis  exchange rate fluctuations and especially larger periodic devaluations will have an impact on fundtech s profitability and period to period comparisons of fundtech s results 
such impact is recorded in fundtech s financial statements as financial income or expense
