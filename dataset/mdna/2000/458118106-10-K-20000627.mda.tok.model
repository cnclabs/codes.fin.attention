the following discussion contains forward looking statements which are based on management s current expectations 
these include  in particular  the statements related to revenues and gross profit  r d and sg a expenses and activities  interest expense  interest income and other  taxes  capital spending and financing transactions  as well as statements regarding successful development and market acceptance of new products  industry conditions and demand  effects of consolidation of production and capacity utilization 
overview idt made significant progress in improving its results from operations during fiscal the improvement in operating results is primarily attributable to increased revenues from target and other markets  reduced manufacturing costs per unit sold associated with more efficient manufacturing operations  reduced operating costs primarily associated with more focused research and development efforts  and overall improved conditions in the semiconductor industry 
revenues increased primarily because of increased unit sales 
idt is focused on selling semiconductor products to customers primarily in communications infrastructure markets 
customer acceptance of idt s new communications products as well as increasing demand for existing products in target markets was the primary factor contributing to the increase in product units sold 
products designed primarily for the communications markets and related applications are also  at times  utilized by other markets and applications 
for example  products in idt s logic and sram product families have broad use in applications outside idt s target communications infrastructure markets and demand for idt products in these other markets also improved during fiscal in fiscal  idt completed the merger with quality semiconductor  inc  qsi which contributed additional revenues 
during fiscal  idt took steps to make its manufacturing operations more efficient 
these steps included closing the company s fabrication facility located in san jose  calif  to improve utilization of the remaining fabrication facilities 
the company also began the process of consolidating qsi manufacturing volumes within existing idt facilities  in a similar effort to increase the utilization of idt s facilities and reduce the cost per unit produced 
idt has subsequently completed the sale of these surplus manufacturing assets to third parties 
to focus its efforts to efficiently serve target communications markets  in fiscal  idt completed the sale of certain x microprocessor assets  including idt s x product research and development subsidiary  centaur technology  inc through the sale of these assets  idt was able to reduce the level of operating expenditures  especially research and development expenses  while increasing development efforts associated with developing products for idt s communications infrastructure markets 
results of operations revenues 
pooling of interests accounting has been used to account for the merger of qsi with idt 
under pooling of interests accounting  idt s past results are restated to include the results of qsi see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million compared to the million recorded in fiscal fiscal revenues decreased by million compared to the million recorded for fiscal the increase in revenues from fiscal to fiscal is primarily the result of increased unit sales of idt s communications and high performance logic and sram and other products  partially offset by a decline in sales of x microprocessor products 
increased unit sales of idt s communications and high performance logic products is principally attributable to the introduction of new products primarily for data networking and wireless communications infrastructure markets as well as increased demand for existing products from customers in these and other markets 
in addition  idt is benefiting from increased levels of demand for the industry standard products which it manufactures for its sram segment 
in september  idt sold certain of its x microprocessor related assets and ceased unit sales of these products in january the company expects that unit demand for the products it offers will now be primarily derived from the communications infrastructure markets 
the company believes revenues and costs associated with existing and new products in the communications and high performance logic and srams and other segments will increase in future periods as the company continues to execute new product introduction strategies and assuming that overall levels of industry demand continue to improve 
idt does not expect any future x microprocessor unit sales 
the merger of qsi into the company was completed in fiscal revenue  costs and operating margins from qsi products have been included in the company s results reported for its communications and high performance logic segment 
idt commenced the process of combining idt s and qsi s manufacturing operations after the merger was completed in fiscal in may  idt completed the sale of surplus manufacturing assets related to the former qsi operations 
during fiscal  idt entered into a cross license with intel corp 
intel and received as consideration million 
of this amount  million was recognized as revenue in the second quarter of fiscal the remaining revenue associated with the cross license with intel is being recognized over seven years  the estimated remaining useful life of the relevant intellectual property 
gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal was million  compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
on an operating basis excluding restructuring  asset impairment and other special costs and benefits  gross margin showed sequential quarterly improvement throughout fiscal and reached for the year as a whole  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the improvement in idt s gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to higher revenues primarily associated with increased unit sales  and cost savings associated with the consolidation of wafer fabrication production late in fiscal  including the closure of one fabrication facility 
consolidation of production has allowed idt to improve utilization of its remaining fabrication facilities  resulting in a lower overall cost per unit produced 
idt s gross margin also improved in fiscal over fiscal because of a reduction in depreciation expense resulting from lower carrying values of impaired manufacturing assets 
special items impacting gross profit in fiscal included million in intel licensing revenue  which carried little related costs  and million in net positive adjustments and reversals relating to the completion in fiscal of restructuring activities commenced in fiscal and finalizing the related accounting 
in fiscal  the company recorded a million charge to cost of sales which related primarily to excess sram manufacturing equipment million and certain technology licensing matters million  of which million was reversed later in fiscal upon settlement of certain of these matters 
the net carrying value of this equipment before writedown was million  and after writedown was million 
the excess sram manufacturing equipment charge represented a writedown to estimated fair market value based primarily on appraisals and third party estimates 
the charge was the result of prevailing economic conditions in the sram market  which had undergone declines in both demand and price 
the charge for manufacturing equipment resulted in annual depreciation expense savings of approximately million 
also in fiscal  the company recorded an r d expense charge of million relating primarily to discontinuing certain technology development initiatives see research and development below 
additionally  the company recorded a million asset impairment and other charge in fiscal which related primarily to an asset impairment reserve recorded against the manufacturing assets of idt s eight inch wafer fabrication facility in hillsboro  ore 
the company determined that due to excess industry capacity and low prices for semiconductor products manufactured in the hillsboro facility  future undiscounted cash flows related to its wafer fabrication assets were insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets 
as a result  the company wrote down these assets to estimated fair market value based primarily on appraisals and estimates from independent parties 
of the million  million was related to certain patent claims against the company 
the company reversed million in fiscal upon final settlement of these claims 
as a result of asset impairment charges in fiscal  which reduced the carrying value of manufacturing equipment  idt s annual depreciation expense was reduced by approximately million 
the company incurred restructuring charges of million in fiscal related primarily to a provision for exit and closure costs associated with the san jose wafer fabrication facility  which the company closed in the third quarter of fiscal the company completed the sale of this facility in the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded a million reserve adjustment  benefiting gross profit  upon the settlement of an intellectual property dispute 
as a result of the restructuring actions  the company realized annual cost savings in depreciation  labor  equipment and other costs of approximately million  which were partially realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal and fully realized in fiscal research and development 
for fiscal  research and development r d expenses decreased by million compared to fiscal r d expenses increased by million from fiscal to fiscal r d expenses decreased in fiscal for three principal reasons 
first  expenses related to developing process technology have been reduced in fiscal because of the closure of idt s san jose wafer fabrication facility  and the consolidation of all process development activities solely at the hillsboro facility 
second  the allocation of manufacturing costs associated with process r d has decreased in fiscal as a result of fewer fabrication facilities and continued improved manufacturing facility utilization at the remaining facilities 
with increased utilization of equipment for production activities  allocations of costs to r d activities have decreased based upon the nature of activities performed 
third  expenses to develop x microprocessor products decreased in the second half of fiscal  as the company completed the sale of its austin  texas x microprocessor design center during the second quarter of fiscal r d expenses in fiscal also included million in charges  primarily associated with discontinuing efforts to develop certain new products  including a graphics chip and a specialized logic chip 
cost savings associated with discontinuing these development efforts are approximately million per quarter 
management expects that in fiscal  r d expense will increase in absolute dollars from fiscal s levels 
the company intends to increase its investment in new product and technology development in an effort to increase revenues in its target networking and telecommunications customer markets 
as a percentage of revenue  management expects r d expense to remain relatively constant  assuming that business conditions and overall industry demand continue to improve 
current r d activities include enhancing idt s families of integrated products such as fifos and multi ported communications products  expanding idt s offerings of networking and switching products  developing a new family of risc based processors which integrate networking functions  broadening idt s high performance logic and clock product portfolios  delivering two new families of integrated communications products targeted at improving customers router system performance and providing gateways for voice traffic over the internet 
additionally  idt is developing advanced manufacturing process technologies  including micron semiconductor fabrication techniques  designed to produce performance advantages and expand the volumes of semiconductor products produced to allow continued growth of idt s communications products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were essentially flat for fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  sg a decreased from to over this period 
the company expects that in coming quarters  recurring sg a expenses will increase slightly  principally related to costs such as sales commissions and sales bonuses which vary in relation to sales volumes  and marketing expenses related to new product introductions 
assuming continued strong business conditions and improving overall industry demand  management expects sg a spending as a percentage of revenues to decline in fiscal sg a in fiscal included expenses associated with x microprocessor marketing and enterprise wide management information system upgrades 
these fiscal expenses were largely responsible for the million increase in sg a from fiscal to fiscal merger expenses 
the company incurred million in expenses related to the qsi merger in the first quarter of fiscal  including million in severance and employee retention costs 
interest expense 
interest expense is primarily associated with the convertible subordinated notes  due in  and secured equipment financing agreements which amortize over the term of the financing agreements 
excluding historical amounts related to qsi  annual interest expense was essentially unchanged during the fiscal period 
substantially all of the notes were converted into common stock  in the first quarter of fiscal see subsequent events  below 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net  was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal special items in fiscal included net gains of million primarily related to the sale of idt s x design subsidiary and x processor related intellectual property  a realized net gain of million on the sale of a portion of the company s equity investment in quantum effect devices  inc qed  and a gain of million on the sale of the company s san jose fabrication facility 
interest income increased by million in fiscal as a result of higher cash equivalents and investment balances 
interest income and other  net for fiscal and includes losses of million and million  respectively  related to idt s equity interest in clear logic  inc the company does not expect to record additional losses related to this investment in fiscal  as the clear logic investment was fully amortized in fiscal taxes 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the tax rate in fiscal was lower than the federal rate primarily due to the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers to reduce the company s actual tax liability 
in view of the cumulative losses incurred during fiscal  and in consideration of current accounting literature and related interpretations  which require that reserves be taken for net deferred tax assets when there is significant doubt as to whether such assets will be realized  idt recorded a reserve for all of its existing net deferred tax assets in fiscal the company realized no federal tax benefit in fiscal because of its inability to carry back losses 
the effective tax rate for fiscal of differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to differences in us and foreign tax rates  changes in valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  and the utilization of certain tax credits 
historically  income taxes in state jurisdictions have not been significant  due mainly to available tax credits 
idt currently enjoys certain tax benefits in malaysia and the philippines  mainly as a result of tax holidays and certain investment incentives 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company currently expects its effective tax rate for fiscal to be 
should the company s profits during fiscal differ significantly from planned levels  the company s tax rate could change 
liquidity and capital resources at april   cash and cash equivalents were million  an increase of million from million at march  additionally the company had short term investments  excluding equity securities  of million and million at april  and march   respectively 
the company also holds equity securities consisting of common stock of qed  which completed an initial public offering in fiscal the company sold a portion of its holdings as part of the public offering  recognizing a pretax net gain of million 
the remaining million shares of qed common stock owned by idt are recorded on the april   balance sheet at their then current fair value of approximately per share  while related unrealized gains are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company generated million in cash from operating activities during fiscal  up from million for fiscal cash from operating activities in fiscal was relatively low due to the company s net loss in that year  partially offset by noncash items 
during fiscal  the company s net cash used for investing activities was million 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  the company received million in proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment  consisting primarily of the sale of its former san jose fabrication facility  which was closed during fiscal in connection with the company s restructuring efforts  and assets associated with the company s x design subsidiary 
financing activities provided million during fiscal financing activities during the year included the repurchase and retirement of a portion of the convertible subordinated notes for million 
the notes had a face value of million 
idt anticipates capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  to be financed primarily through cash generated from operations and existing cash and investments 
the company may also investigate other financing alternatives  depending on whether available terms are favorable to the company 
the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and credit sources available to the company will be sufficient to meet its working capital  debt repayment and anticipated capital expenditure requirements through fiscal and there can be no assurance however  that the company will not be required to seek additional external financing sooner or that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
if the company is required to seek such external financing  the unavailability of financing on terms satisfactory to idt could have a material adverse effect on the company 
subsequent events substantially all holders of the company s convertible notes converted their notes into common stock in may  increasing the number of shares outstanding by approximately million 
as a result of the conversion  the company expects a significant reduction in interest expense in future periods 
factors affecting future results idt s operating results can fluctuate dramatically 
idt s operating results can fluctuate dramatically 
for example  the company had net income of million for fiscal compared to a net loss of million for fiscal and net income of million for fiscal fluctuations in operating results can result from a wide variety of factors  including o timing of new product and process technology announcements and introductions from idt or its competitors  o competitive pricing pressures  particularly in the sram market  o fluctuations in manufacturing yields  o changes in the mix of products sold  o availability and costs of raw materials  o the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and industry wide wafer processing capacity  o economic conditions in various geographic areas  and o costs associated with other events  such as underutilization or expansion of production capacity  intellectual property disputes  or other litigation 
in addition  many of these factors also impact the recoverability of the cost of manufacturing  tax and other assets 
as business conditions change  future writedowns or abandonment of these assets may occur 
also  the company ships a substantial portion of its products in the last month of a quarter 
if anticipated shipments in any quarter do not occur  idt s operating results for that quarter could be harmed 
further  idt may be unable to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors  and idt s operating results could be harmed by increased competition 
idt s operating results are also impacted by changes in overall economic conditions  both domestically and abroad 
idt derives almost of its revenues from overseas sales 
continued uncertainties in some foreign economies  such as korea  japan  and other countries may reduce demand for idt s products 
should economic conditions deteriorate  domestically or overseas  the company s sales and business results would be harmed 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry exacerbates the volatility of idt s operating results 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
market conditions characterized by excess supply relative to demand and resultant pricing declines have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
such pricing declines adversely affect idt s operating results and force idt and its competitors to modify their capacity expansion programs 
as an example  in prior years a significant increase in manufacturing capacity allocated to industry standard sram components caused significant downward trends in pricing  which adversely affected idt s gross margins and operating results 
idt is unable to accurately estimate the amount of worldwide production capacity dedicated to or planned for the industry standard products  such as sram  that it produces 
idt s operating results can be adversely affected by such factors in the semiconductor industry as a material increase in industry wide production capacity  a shift in industry capacity toward products competitive with idt s products  and reduced demand or other factors that may result in material declines in product pricing and could affect idt s operating results 
although idt is attempting to reduce its dependence on revenue derived from the sale of industry standard products  and while the company seeks to carefully manage costs  these efforts may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effect the above or other industry related factors can have on the company s results 
demand for idt s products depends on demand in the communications  and to a lesser extent  computer markets 
the majority of the company s products are incorporated into customers systems in data networking  wireless telecommunications  and other communications applications 
a percentage of the company s products  including its high performance logic components  serve in customers computer  computer related  and other applications 
customer applications for the company s products have historically been characterized by rapid technological change and significant fluctuations in demand 
demand for most idt products  and therefore potential increases in revenue  depends upon growth in the communications market  particularly in the data networking and wireless telecommunications infrastructure markets and  to a lesser extent  the computer markets 
any slowdown in these communications or computer related markets could materially adversely affect idt s operating results 
idt s product manufacturing operations are complex and subject to interruption 
from time to time  idt has experienced production difficulties  including reduced manufacturing yields or products that do not meet idt s or its customers specifications  that have caused delivery delays and quality problems 
while production delivery delays have been infrequent and generally short in duration  idt could experience manufacturing problems and product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  complexity of manufacturing processes  changes to its process technologies  and ramping production and installing new equipment at its facilities 
idt has wafer fabrication facilities located in hillsboro  ore 
and salinas  calif 
as a result of the qsi merger  idt also acquired manufacturing assets in eastern australia and other locations 
the sale of qsi related and other surplus manufacturing assets was completed by may substantially all of idt s revenues are derived from products manufactured at facilities which are exposed to the risk of natural disasters  including earthquakes 
approximately of idt s total revenue is derived from products manufactured at its fabrication facility in salinas which is located near an active earthquake fault 
if idt were unable to use its facilities  as a result of a natural disaster  or otherwise  idt s operations would be materially adversely affected until the company was able to obtain other production capability 
idt does not carry earthquake insurance on its facilities or related to its business operations  as adequate protection is not offered at economically justifiable rates 
historically  idt has utilized subcontractors for the majority of its incremental assembly requirements  typically at higher costs than its own malaysian and philippines assembly and test operations 
idt expects to continue utilizing subcontractors extensively to supplement its own production volume capacity 
due to production lead times  any failure by idt to adequately forecast the mix of product demand could adversely affect idt s sales and operating results 
idt s operating results can be substantially impacted by facility expansion  utilization and consolidation 
facility and capacity additions have resulted in a significant increase in fixed and variable operating expenses that in the past have not been fully offset when revenues declined 
idt records as r d expense the operating costs associated with bringing a new fabrication facility to commercial production status in the period such expenses are incurred 
however  as commercial production at a new fabrication facility commences  the operating costs are classified as cost of revenues  and idt begins to recognize depreciation expense relating to the facility 
accordingly  if revenue levels are not maintained or if idt is unable to achieve gross margins from products produced at the hillsboro facility that are comparable to idt s other products  idt s future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
idt s results are dependent on the success of new products 
new products and process technology costs associated with the hillsboro wafer fabrication facility will continue to require significant r d expenditures 
however  the company may not be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner  its new products may not gain market acceptance  and it may not be successful in implementing new process technologies 
if idt is unable to develop new products in a timely manner  and to sell them at gross margins comparable to or better than idt s current products  its future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
idt is dependent on a limited number of suppliers 
idt s manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate raw materials on a timely basis 
the number of vendors of certain raw materials  such as silicon wafers  ultra pure metals and certain chemicals and gases  is very limited 
in addition  certain packages used by idt require long lead times and are available from only a few suppliers 
from time to time  vendors have extended lead times or limited supply to idt due to capacity constraints 
idt s results of operations would be adversely affected if it were unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if there were significant increases in the costs of raw materials 
from time to time  idt contracts with third party semiconductor designers 
idt may require additional capital on satisfactory terms to remain competitive 
the semiconductor industry is extremely capital intensive 
to remain competitive  idt continues to invest in advanced manufacturing and test equipment 
idt could be required to seek financing to satisfy its cash and capital needs  and such financing might not be available on terms satisfactory to idt 
if such financing is required and if such financing is not available on terms satisfactory to idt  its operations could be adversely affected 
intellectual property claims could adversely affect idt s business and operations 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in recent years  there has been a growing trend by companies to resort to litigation to protect their semiconductor technology from unauthorized use by others 
idt has been involved in patent litigation in the past  which adversely affected its operating results 
although idt has obtained patent licenses from certain semiconductor manufacturers  idt does not have licenses from a number of semiconductor manufacturers that have a broad portfolio of patents 
idt has been notified that it may be infringing on patents issued to certain semiconductor manufacturers and other parties and is currently involved in license negotiations 
because the patents others are asserting primarily involve manufacturing processes  revenues from substantially all of idt s products could be subject to the alleged infringement claims 
additional claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights could be asserted in the future 
the intellectual property claims that have been made or that may be asserted against idt could require that idt discontinue the use of certain processes or cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to incur significant litigation costs and damages and to develop non infringing technology 
the company might not be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or to develop non infringing technology 
further  the failure to renew or renegotiate existing licenses on favorable terms  or the inability to obtain a key license  could adversely affect idt 
international operations add increased volatility to idt s operating results 
a substantial percentage of idt s revenues are derived from non us sales 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  non us sales accounted for  and of idt s revenues  respectively 
during these periods  asia pacific sales  which exclude japan  accounted for  and of idt s revenues  respectively 
sales in japan accounted for  and of total revenues  respectively  during these periods 
in addition  idt s offshore assembly and test operations incur payroll  facilities and other expenses in local currencies 
accordingly  movements in foreign currency exchange rates  can impact idt s cost of goods sold  as well as both pricing and demand for its products 
idt s offshore operations and export sales are also subject to risks associated with foreign operations  including o political instability  o currency controls and fluctuations  o changes in local economic conditions and import and export controls  and o changes in tax laws  tariffs and freight rates 
contract pricing for raw materials used in the fabrication and assembly processes  as well as for subcontract assembly services  can also be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company also purchases certain semiconductor manufacturing tools  such as photo lithography equipment  from overseas vendors 
such tools are typically quoted at a foreign currency price  often equivalent to several million us dollars per unit 
currency exchange rate fluctuations can have a substantial impact on the net us dollar cost of these tools to idt 
idt is subject to risks associated with using hazardous materials in its manufacturing 
idt is subject to a variety of environmental and other regulations related to hazardous materials used in its manufacturing process 
any failure by idt to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous materials under present or future regulations could subject it to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended 
idt s common stock is subject to price volatility 
idt s common stock has experienced substantial price volatility 
such volatility may occur in the future  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of idt  the companies in the semiconductor industry  or those in the markets served by idt 
announcements by idt or its competitors regarding new product introductions may also lead to volatility 
in addition  idt s stock price can fluctuate due to price and volume fluctuations in the stock market  especially those that have affected technology stocks 
idt s product portfolio includes a mix of proprietary or limited source products  and industry standard or multiple source products  idt s products also employ a variety of semiconductor design technologies 
stock price volatility may also result from changes in perceptions about the various types of products idt manufactures and sells 
idt is exposed to fluctuations in the market price of its investment in qed 
the company s investment portfolio includes common stock holdings in qed  as described above 
the common stock of qed is highly volatile 
at the same time  the company is precluded from selling or hedging the value of any of its current holdings until july  due to underwriting agreement restrictions 
as a result of these factors  the amount of income and cash flow that idt ultimately realizes from this investment in future periods may vary materially from the current unrealized amount 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
most of the company s outstanding debt  including the convertible subordinated notes  is at fixed rates 
the tax ownership operating lease related to idt s manufacturing facilities in hillsboro has variable  london interbank offered rate libor based payments 
however  this synthetic lease is collateralized with investments that have similar  and thus offsetting  interest rate characteristics 
the company s investment portfolio typically consists of short term securities that have managed maturity schedules 
as a result of these factors  a hypothetical move in interest rates would have an insignificant effect on idt s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of international sales  assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  and capital purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
the company uses derivative financial instruments primarily forward contracts to help manage its foreign currency exchange exposures 
the company does not enter in derivatives for trading purposes 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis for both fiscal and and determined that a change in the value of the us dollar would have an insignificant near term impact on idt s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
impact of year on idt s operations 
the company has completed the transition from calendar year to and conducted internal tests for year issues 
no significant impact to the company s operations or its business and manufacturing systems has been detected 
the company will continue to monitor its systems  facilities and products over the next few months to ensure that latent defects do not manifest themselves 
such follow up will be encompassed into the normal monitoring of company systems and operations 
amounts paid to manufacturing equipment vendors to obtain software upgrades to remediate year issues totaled approximately  idt also paid keane  inc  a software services firm  approximately  in consulting fees 
residual year and monitoring costs after april  are not expected to be significant 
requirements associated with the introduction of the euro 
idt is continuing to monitor and evaluate the impact of the introduction of the single european currency euro 
during the transition period ending december   public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro common currency or the legacy currency of the participating country 
beginning january   euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  with the legacy currencies being completely withdrawn from circulation on june  idt is in the process of evaluating the impact of the euro s introduction on the company s pricing policies  foreign currency hedging tactics  and administrative systems and costs 
based on its ongoing evaluation  idt does not currently expect the cost of any system modifications to be material and does not expect that the euro will have a material adverse impact on idt s business activities  financial condition or overall trends in results of operations
