item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview since  we have transitioned to primarily leasing portable storage units from primarily selling them 
this has caused the composition of our revenues and expenses to change 
leasing revenues as a percentage of our total revenues increased to in from in  in and in from the end of to the end of  we increased the number of portable storage units in our lease fleet from  to  this is an average annual growth rate in units of approximately 
our leasing revenues include all rent we receive for our portable storage units 
our sales revenues include sales of portable storage units and other structures to customers 
our other revenues consist principally of charges for the delivery of the portable storage units we sell 
our principal operating expenses are cost of sales  leasing  selling and general expenses  and depreciation and amortization  primarily depreciation of the portable storage units in our lease fleet 
cost of sales includes both our cost to buy  refurbish and modify used iso shipping containers and our cost to manufacture portable storage units and other structures 
leasing  selling and general expenses include advertising and other marketing expenses  commissions and corporate overhead for both our leasing and sales activities 
annual repair and maintenance expenses on our leased units have averaged approximately of lease revenues 
we expense our repair and maintenance costs as incurred 
our portable storage units are depreciated on the straight line method over our units estimated useful life of years  with salvage values estimated at of our unit investment 
results of operations the following table shows the percentage of total revenues represented by the key items that make up our statements of operations 
you should read this table and the discussion below with our financial statements

in  we opened seven new branches  six of which were through acquisitions 
the new branches were in salt lake city  colorado springs  new orleans  memphis  chicago  knoxville and tulsa 
we also acquired operations in seven markets we already operated in 
the branches in new markets generated an increase in units leased of in and accounted for of our increase in leasing revenues 
leasing revenues at branches open more than one year excluding operations acquired from others increased by

cost of sales decreased to of sales revenues in from of sales revenues in during  we paid less for used iso shipping containers and also produced more portable storage units at our manufacturing plant than in these factors resulted in the higher gross margin on portable storage unit sales in leasing  selling and general expenses increased to million in from million in we had higher leasing related expenses because of the increase in the average number of units on lease  higher commissions because of our higher leasing volume and million of expenses associated with the six branches in new markets we acquired and the one branch we started in both acquired and start up branches initially have lower profit margins until the branches fixed operating costs are covered by higher leasing volumes 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to of total revenue in from in this increase resulted from our larger lease fleet  additional equipment needed for manufacturing and maintaining the lease fleet and other equipment added at our branches 
our operating margin increased to in from in principally because we focused on leasing rather than selling our portable storage units and because leasing  selling and general expenses decreased as a percent of leasing revenues 
as a result  income from operations increased by to million in from million in interest expense increased by to million in from million in as a result of higher average debt outstanding during interest expense as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in our average debt outstanding increased by  due to an additional million of borrowings under our credit facility 
we used this debt financing primarily to expand our lease fleet 
the weighted average interest rate declined to in from in  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
including amortization of debt issuance costs  the weighted average interest rate was in and in net income before extraordinary charges in was million  or per diluted share of common stock  compared to net income in of million  or per diluted share of common stock 
during the company recorded a per share extraordinary charge in connection with the early extinguishment of our million of senior subordinated notes which were originally scheduled to mature in november our increase in net income primarily resulted from our higher leasing revenues in and a decrease in leasing  selling and general expenses per unit on lease in our effective tax rate was for both and we had a increase in the weighted average number of common and common share equivalents outstanding in primarily because of a public offering of million shares of our common stock in may and june compared to total revenues in increased by to million from million in leasing revenues in increased by to million from million in these increases resulted from a increase in the average number of portable storage units on lease and a increase in the average rent per unit 
in  we opened four new branches  three of which were through acquisitions 
the new branches were in las vegas  oklahoma city  denver and albuquerque 
these new branches accounted for of our increase in leasing revenues 
our eight branches which operated in and accounted for of the increase in our leasing revenues 
our revenues from the sale of portable storage units and other structures decreased by to million in from million in this reflects our focus on leasing rather than selling portable storage units 
this decrease was also caused by our decision in to curtail the sale of telecommunication shelters and discontinue our dealer program 
cost of sales decreased to of sales revenues in from in during  we paid less for both used iso shipping containers and the steel we use to manufacture portable storage units 
we also produced more portable storage units at our manufacturing plant in than in as a result  our fixed manufacturing expenses were allocated over more units and resulted in a higher gross margin on portable storage unit sales in leasing  selling and general expenses increased by million to of total revenues in from in we had higher leasing related expenses because of the increase in the number of units on lease  higher commissions because of our higher leasing volume and million of expenses associated with the three branches we acquired and the one branch we started in both acquired and start up branches initially have lower profit margins until the branches fixed operating costs are covered by higher leasing volumes 
however  these expenses decreased to of our leasing revenues in from in depreciation and amortization expenses increased by  to of total revenues in from in this increase resulted from our larger lease fleet  additional equipment needed for manufacturing and other equipment added at our branches 
our operating margin increased to of total revenues in from in principally because we focused on leasing rather than selling portable storage units and because leasing  selling and general expenses decreased as a percentage of leasing revenues 
as a result  income from operations increased by to million in from million in interest expense increased by to million in from million in because we had higher average debt outstanding during our average debt outstanding increased by  consisting of million of senior subordinated notes issued in october and an additional million of borrowings under our credit facility 
we used this debt financing primarily to expand our lease fleet 
the weighted average interest rate declined to in from in  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
including amortization of debt issuance costs  the weighted average interest rate was in and in we reported net income in of million  or per diluted share of common stock  compared to net income in of million  or per diluted share of common stock 
these increases were primarily because of our higher leasing revenues in and the decrease in leasing  selling and general expenses as a percentage of leasing revenues in our effective tax rate was for both and we had a increase in the weighted average number of common and common share equivalents outstanding in because of the exercise of warrants we had issued in and common stock issued in connection with the acquisitions completed during liquidity and capital resources our leasing and manufacturing businesses are very capital intensive 
we have financed our working capital requirements through cash flows from operations  proceeds from equity and debt financings and borrowings under our credit facility 
operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million in  million in and million in this increasing cash flow resulted primarily from our higher net income and the impact of depreciation expense and deferred income taxes 
the growth of our business  however  has required us to use more cash to support higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in this increasing use of cash resulted primarily from higher levels of capital expenditures for lease fleet expansion and acquisitions 
capital expenditures for our lease fleet were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in  million in and million in in addition  we spent million including million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock in and million in for acquisitions 
no acquisitions were completed in financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in during  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily from a public offering of  shares of common stock 
we received gross proceeds of approximately million from this offering 
we also received approximately  from the exercise of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
we also borrowed an additional million under our credit facility 
the net cash provided by financing activities was used to expand our lease fleet  finance acquisitions  and prepay our senior subordinated notes 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily from million of net borrowings under our credit facility and million of gross proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the majority of warrants exercised were issued in connection with our initial public offering in we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective in september  under which mobile mini is designated as the fixed rate payer at an interest rate of per annum 
under the swap agreement  the company has effectively fixed  for a three year period  the interest rate payable on million of our revolving line of credit so that the rate is based upon a spread from  rather than a spread from the eurodollar rate 
since march  our principal source of liquidity has been our credit facility  which currently consists of a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
the interest rate under our credit facility is determined quarterly  based on our ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
during  the average interest rate under our credit facility was 
as of february  we had million of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  and million of additional borrowings were available 
the amount we can borrow under the revolving line of credit portion of our credit facility is based upon the level of our inventories  accounts receivable and the value of our lease fleet 
the lease fleet is appraised at least annually for purposes of the credit facility 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets  including all of our portable storage units 
the credit facility includes a term loan due in march the term loan had an outstanding principal balance of million at december  we must make principal and interest payments monthly on the term loan 
in october  we issued million of senior subordinated notes with detachable redeemable warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
these notes were due november  but could be prepaid beginning november  without a prepayment penalty 
we redeemed the entire principal balance outstanding on november  because the notes were sold with redeemable warrants  a portion of the sale price was allocated to the notes and a portion to the redeemable warrants  based on their respective fair market values 
the resulting discount increased the effective interest rate on the notes  and was amortized as interest expense over the life of the notes 
in connection with the early redemption of these notes  we recorded an extraordinary charge of  net of our tax provision  in we believe that our working capital  together with our cash flow from operations  borrowing under our credit facility and other available funding sources will be sufficient to fund our operations and controlled growth for the next months 
we believe that in order to maintain historical growth rates we will be required to obtain additional debt financing or raise additional equity capital by issuing additional shares of our stock 
however  we cannot be sure that we can obtain the necessary debt or equity capital on acceptable terms 
seasonality during the past three years  our operation as a whole has not been very seasonal 
demand for leases of our portable storage units is stronger from september through december because retailers need to store more inventory for the holiday season 
our retail customers usually return leased units to us early in the following year 
this has caused lower utilization rates for our lease fleet and a marginal decrease in cash flow during the first quarters of the past several years 
year compliance and expenditures our program to address the year issue consisted of the following phases inventory  assessment  correction  testing and implementation 
as of december   all phases were completed 
we did not experience any significant disruption as a result of the year issue 
our total costs to remedy the year issue were approximately  we can provide no assurance that all supplier and customer year compliance plans were successfully completed 
we are not aware of any problems with any of our suppliers  customers or third party providers that would negatively impact our operations or adversely affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates through a financial arrangement intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
an interest rate swap agreement is the only instrument used by the company to manage interest rate fluctuations affecting the company s variable rate debt 
the company currently has one outstanding interest rate swap agreement covering million of our debt  under which the company pays a fixed rate and receives a variable interest rate 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of the company s debt portfolio total fair at december  total at value at december  december  thereafter liabilities fixed rate in s average interest rate floating rate in s        average interest rate interest rate swaps variable to fixed in s    average pay rate average receive rate mo libor bba the company enters into derivative financial arrangements only to the extent that it meets the objectives described above  and the company does not engage in such transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s credit facility matures in  including a one year extension option 
these variable rate liabilities will continue to increase due to future growth until maturity 
see note line of credit in the notes to financial statements incorporated herein by reference for further description of the variable rate liability 
management intends to renew or replace the line of credit with similar arrangements or debt prior to maturity  on terms reasonably similar to their existing terms 
we  however  cannot be certain that such financing will be available or on terms acceptable to us
