item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity prices century produces primary aluminum products and the company s earnings are exposed to aluminum price fluctuations 
the company manages this risk through the issuance of fixed price commitments and financial instruments 
the company does not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
although the company has not materially participated in the purchase of call options  in cases where century sells forward primary aluminum  it may purchase call options to preserve the benefit from price increases significantly above forward sales prices 
in addition  it may purchase put options to protect itself from price decreases 
the company had fixed price commitments to sell million pounds of primary aluminum at december  and million pounds of primary aluminum  scrap aluminum  and sheet and plate products at december  of the total fixed price sales commitments  million pounds and million pounds at december  and  respectively  were with the glencore group 
the company had no fixed price commitments to purchase aluminum at december  the company had fixed price commitments to purchase million pounds of aluminum and alloy raw materials at december  of the total fixed price purchase commitments  million pounds at december  were with the glencore group 
in addition  the company has a long term supply agreement for million pounds of alumina annually  whereby  the company will pay a fixed price for alumina with annual price increases of approximately through at december  and  the company had entered into million and million pounds  respectively  of forward primary aluminum sales contracts primarily with the glencore group to mitigate the risk of commodity price fluctuations inherent in a portion of its inventory 
the contracts will be settled in cash at various dates in and based on market prices at december  and  the forward sales contracts could have been settled by the company paying approximately million and receiving million  respectively 
the actual settlement was and will be based on market prices on the respective settlement dates

a hypothetical per pound increase in the market price of primary aluminum is estimated to have an unfavorable impact of million on pre tax income in as a result of the forward primary aluminum purchase and sale contracts entered into by the company at december  actual changes in commodity prices may differ from hypothetical changes 
this quantification of the company s exposure to the commodity price of aluminum is necessarily limited  as it does not take into consideration the company s inventory or fixed price commitments  or the offsetting impact upon the purchase price of raw materials and sales price of aluminum products 
all gains and losses from forward contract activity are reported separately in the statements of operations 
unrealized gains or losses on the forward primary aluminum contracts  realized gains or losses from the cash settlement of the forward primary aluminum contracts  and reversals of prior period unrealized losses are reported as either gains or losses on forward contracts
