the company owns and leases portable hot mix asphalt plants and related paving equipment and a rubberized asphalt plant 
the asphalt paving capabilities provide the company the opportunity to expand its existing geographic market  enhance its construction operations in its existing market  improve its competitiveness and may generate increased revenues on projects that call for large quantities of asphaltic concrete  recycled asphalt or rubberized asphalt 
in  the company expanded its nevada construction industry activities with the formation of ready mix  inc rmi as a wholly owned subsidiary 
rmi manufactures and distributes ready mix concrete and owns and operates a construction materials processing plant in the las vegas  nv area

rmi began its ready mix concrete operation from its first location in march and began processing construction materials in november financed with internal funds  a million line of credit  notes payable and operating leases  rmi intends to operate from two or more sites using at least mixer trucks 
during january  the company ordered mixer trucks at an estimated cost of  in  the company formed prestressed products incorporated ppi as a wholly owned subsidiary to design  manufacture and erect precast prestressed concrete building components for use on commercial  institutional and public construction projects throughout the southwest 
product lines included architectural and structural building components and prestressed bridge girders for highway construction 
during  ppi began operations with a precast yard and concrete batch plant located on leased property adjacent to the company s office in moapa  nevada 
as a result of continuing operating losses  in june  the company adopted a formal plan the plan to discontinue the operations of ppi 
the plan included the completion of approximately million of uncompleted contracts and the disposition of approximately million of equipment 
the company recorded an estimated loss of  net of income tax benefit of  related to the disposal of assets of ppi  which included a provision of  for estimated losses during the phase out period of july  through june  during the twelve months ended december  and   and  of the expected losses were incurred net of income tax benefit of  and 
in  the company expanded its construction materials processing operations within its geographic area 
during january  the company purchased equipment in the amount of  and has requested finance proposals for equipment totaling approximately  related to its construction materials processing operations 
the company s backlog anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of awarded projects was approximately million at december   compared to approximately million at december  at december   the company s backlog included approximately million of work that is scheduled for completion during accordingly  revenue in and will be significantly reduced if the company is unable to obtain substantial new projects in the company includes a construction project in its backlog at such time as a contract is awarded or a firm letter of commitment is obtained 
the company believes that its backlog figures are firm  subject to provisions contained in its contracts which allow customers to modify or cancel the contracts at any time upon payment of a relatively small cancellation fee 
the company has not been materially adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications in the past 
revenue is impacted in any one period by the backlog at the beginning of the period 
the company s backlog depends upon the company s success in the competitive bid process 
the company s projects are obtained primarily through competitive bidding and negotiations in response to advertisements by federal  state and local government agencies and solicitations by private parties 
the company submits bids after a detailed review of the project specifications  an internal review of the company s capabilities and equipment availability and an assessment of whether the project is likely to attain targeted profit margins 
the company owns  leases  or is readily able to rent  any equipment necessary to complete the projects upon which it bids 
after computing estimated costs of the project to be bid  the company adds its desired profit margin before submitting its bid 
the company believes that success in the competitive bidding process involves i being selective on projects bid upon in order to conserve resources  ii identifying projects which require the company s specific expertise  iii becoming familiar with all aspects of the project to avoid costly bidding errors and iv analyzing the local market to determine the availability and cost of labor and the degree of competition 
revenue on uncompleted fixed price contracts is recorded under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the company begins to recognize revenue on its contracts when it first accrues direct costs 
contracts often involve work periods in excess of one year and revisions in cost and profit estimates during construction are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revision become known 
losses on contracts  if any  are provided in total when determined  regardless of the percent complete 
claims for additional contract revenue are recognized only to the extent that contract costs relating to the claim have been incurred and evidence provides a legal basis for the claim 
pursuant to construction industry practice  a portion of billings  generally not exceeding  may be retained by the customer until the project is completed and all obligations of the contractor are paid 
the company has not been subject to a loss in connection with any such retention 
the company has historically relied upon a small number of projects to generate a significant portion of its revenue 
for instance  revenue generated from six projects represented of the company s revenue for the year ended december  results for any one calendar quarter may fluctuate widely depending upon the stage of completion of the company s active projects

the company currently has available from a commercial bank a million operating line of credit at an interest rate of the commercial bank s prime plus 
line of credit 
at december   and as of the filing date of this report  nothing had been drawn on the line of credit 
under the line of credit  the company is required to maintain certain levels of working capital  to promptly pay all its obligations and is precluded from conveying  selling or leasing all or substantially all of its assets 
at december   the company was in full compliance with all such covenants and there are no material covenants or restrictions in the line of credit which the company believes would impair its operations 
the line of credit expires september  during january  the company solicited finance proposals for equipment totaling  related to its construction materials processing operations 
in addition  the company ordered mixer trucks at an estimated cost of  the company anticipates the equipment and mixer trucks will be financed using notes payable and or operating leases 
in february  the company ordered an asphalt hot mix plant  which is included in the solicited finance proposals  with an estimated cost of  the company anticipates that a substantial portion of the costs associated with a planned second ready mix plant and related equipment will be financed through bank financing and operating leases 
in addition  the company is currently leasing approximately ready mix trucks with annual lease payments of approximately  management believes that the company s cash reserves  together with its lines of credit and its capacity to enter into other financing arrangements are sufficient to fund its cash requirements for the next months and that the company s working capital will be adequate to fund its short term and long term requirements 
impact of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its operations 
however  substantial increases in labor costs  worker compensation rates and employee benefits  equipment costs  material or subcontractor costs could adversely affect the operations of the company for future periods 
year at this time  the company has not been adversely affected by the year the company does not anticipate any future disruptions to business  but cannot be assured that any disruptions to business arising from customers or vendors may not affect its operations 
known and anticipated future trends and contingencies during and early  the company was the focal point of a union organizing effort spearheaded by the building and trades organizing project btop 
in mid the btop reduced its presence in the las vegas area and  as a result  the company has currently ceased being the target of their organizing activities 
subject to the company s profitability and increases in retained earnings  it is anticipated that its bonding limits will increase proportionately  thereby allowing the company to bid on and perform more and larger projects 
the company believes that government at all levels will continue to be the primary source of funding for infrastructure work 
tea establishes a total budget authority of billion over the six year period tea ensures that tax revenue deposited into the highway trust fund will be spent on transportation improvements by guaranteeing billion for highways and billion for transit and by further stipulating that appropriators can spend trust fund dollars only on transportation 
see market overview 
the competitive bidding process will continue to be the dominant method for determining contract award 
however  other innovative bidding methods will be tried and may gain favor  namely a plus b contracts  where the bidders proposals are selected on both price and scheduling criteria 
design build projects are becoming more common and are likely to increase in frequency 
design build projects also tend to be of more worth to the owner when the contract size is substantial  usually million or more 
in light of the rising needs for infrastructure work throughout the nation and the tendency of the current needs to out pace the supply of funds  it is anticipated that alternative funding sources will continue to be sought 
funding for infrastructure development in the united states is coming from a growing variety of innovative sources 
an increase of funding measures is being undertaken by various levels of government to help solve traffic congestion and related air quality problems 
sales taxes  fuel taxes  user fees in a variety of forms  vehicle license taxes  private toll roads and quasi public toll roads are examples of how transportation funding is evolving 
transportation norms are being challenged by federally mandated air quality standards 
improving traffic movement  eliminating congestion  increasing public transit  adding or designating high occupancy vehicle hov lanes to encourage car pooling and other solutions are being considered in order to help meet epa imposed air quality standards 
seasonality the construction industry is seasonal  generally due to inclement weather occurring in the winter months 
accordingly  the company may experience a seasonal pattern in its operating results with lower revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year than other quarters 
quarterly results may also be affected by the timing of bid solicitations by governmental authorities  the stage of completion of major projects and revenue recognition policies 
results for any one quarter  therefore  may not be indicative of results for other quarters or for the year
