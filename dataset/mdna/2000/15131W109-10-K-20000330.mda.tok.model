item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impact of the year issue filed with this report 
certain firrea and the fdic improvement act regulatory requirements and limitations  to which the bank is subject  are discussed below 
loans to one borrower limitations 
firrea imposed limitations on the aggregate amount of loans that a savings association could make to any one borrower  including related entities 
under firrea  the permissible amount of loans to one borrower follows the national bank standard for all loans made by savings associations 
the national bank standard generally does not permit loans to one borrower to exceed of unimpaired capital and surplus 
loans in an amount equal to an additional of unimpaired capital and surplus also may be made to a borrower if the loans are fully secured by readily marketable securities 
at december   the bank had no borrowers to which it had outstanding loans in excess of its loans to one borrower limit 
regulatory capital requirements 
federally insured savings associations and banks are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital 
pursuant to firrea  the ots and the fdic have established capital standards applicable to the bank 
the ots is also authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case by case basis 
as of december   the bank exceeded all minimum levels of regulatory capital 
see note of the consolidated financial statements filed with this report 
in august  the ots adopted a final rule incorporating an interest rate risk component into the risk based capital regulation 
under the rule  an institution with a greater than normal level of interest rate risk will be subject to a deduction of its interest rate risk component from total capital for purposes of calculating its risk based capital requirement 
as a result  such an institution will be required to maintain additional capital in order to comply with the risk based capital requirement 
the final rule was effective january  however  the date that institutions are first required to deduct the interest rate risk component has been postponed indefinitely until a final rule is published by the ots 
pursuant to the rule  the bank would have not been subject to the interest rate risk component as of december  effective december   the ots updated the guidance that it provides to savings institutions such as the bank to provide savings institutions with additional  detailed information concerning the management of interest rate risk  investment securities  and derivatives activities 
capital distributions 
limitations are imposed upon all capital distributions by savings institutions  including cash dividends  payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares  payments by an institution to shareholders of another institution in a cash out merger  and other distributions charged against capital 
the ots issued a final rule  effective april   updating and streamlining the regulations governing capital distributions by savings institutions like the bank 
the intent of the ots was to conform its capital distribution regulations more closely with the distribution requirements established by other banking agencies 
as a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  the bank must file a notice of a proposed capital distribution with the ots 
qualified thrift lender test 
the qtl test requires that qualified thrift investments represent of portfolio assets 
portfolio assets are defined as total assets less intangibles  properties used to conduct the institution s business  and liquid assets up to of total assets 
the penalties for failure to meet the qtl test are substantial 
any savings institution that fails to meet the test either must convert to a commercial bank charter or comply with the restrictions imposed for noncompliance 
if the institution does not convert to a commercial bank  its new investments and activities shall be limited to those permissible for a national bank  and it shall be subject to national bank branching limitations 
both the investment and activities powers and the branching rights available to national banks are generally more restrictive than those available to savings institutions 
in addition  the institution is immediately ineligible to receive any new fhlb advances and is subject to national bank limits on the payment of dividends 
if such institution has not requalified as a qtl or converted to a commercial bank charter within three years after the failure  it then must divest all investments and cease all activities not permissible for a national bank and must repay promptly any outstanding fhlb advances 
if any institution that fails the qtl test is controlled by a holding company  then within one year after the failure  the holding company must register as a bank holding company and thereby become subject to all restrictions on bank holding companies 
at december   the bank s qualified thrift investments as a percentage of its total assets exceeded the percentage required to qualify the bank under the qtl test in effect at that time 
the bank will remain in compliance unless its monthly average percentage of qualified thrift investments to portfolio assets falls below in nine months out of any month period 
liquidity 
all savings institutions  including the bank  are required to maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets equal to a certain percentage of the sum of its average daily balance of net withdrawable deposit accounts and borrowings payable in one year or less 
the liquidity requirement may vary from time to time between and depending upon economic conditions and savings flows of all savings institutions 
at the present time  the required liquid asset ratio is 
at december   the bank was in compliance with these requirements  and exceeded the required liquid asset ratio 
insurance of accounts  assessments and regulation by the fdic 
the bank s deposits are insured up to  per insured depositor as defined by law and regulation by the fdic through the saif and the bif 
the saif and the bif are administered and managed by the fdic 
as insurer  the fdic is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by saif and bif insured institutions 
firrea also authorizes the fdic to prohibit any saif and bif insured institution from engaging in any activity that the fdic determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the saif and bif 
the fdic also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions  after first giving the ots an opportunity to take such action 
through the saif  the fdic insures deposits at savings institutions such as the bank  and through the bif  the fdic insures deposits at other financial institutions principally commercial banks  state chartered banks  and certain federally chartered savings banks 
fico assessment rates for the first semiannual period of were set at 
annually for bif assessable deposits and 
annually for saif assessable deposits 
these rates may be adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in assessment bases for the bif and saif 
by law  the fico rate on bif assessable deposits were to be one fifth the rate on saif assessable deposits until the insurance funds are merged or until january   whichever occured first 
there was no fdic assessment for either saif assessable or bif assessable deposits for the first semiannual period of from time to time  there are various proposals that involve increasing the deposit insurance premiums paid by banks and or savings institutions 
the company is unable to predict whether or to what extent the rates that the bank pays for federal deposit insurance may increase in future periods as a result of such proposals 
such increases would adversely affect its operations 
federal home loan bank system 
the bank is a member of the fhlb atlanta  which is one of twelve regional fhlbs that administers the home financing credit functions of savings associations 
as a member of the fhlb system  the bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the fhlb in an amount equal to the greater of of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  of its assets or or such greater fraction as established by the fhlb of its outstanding fhlb advances 
at december   the bank held million in fhlb stock  which was in compliance with these requirements 
federal reserve system 
the federal reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now and super now checking accounts and non personal time deposits 
at december   the bank was in compliance with such requirements 
the balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the federal reserve may be used to satisfy applicable liquidity requirements 
however  because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash  a noninterest bearing account at a federal reserve bank or a pass through account as defined by the federal reserve  the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the company s interest earning assets 
savings institutions are authorized to borrow from the federal reserve bank discount window  but federal reserve regulations require institutions to exhaust other reasonable alternative sources of funds  including fhlb advances  before borrowing from the federal reserve bank 
federal securities laws the company s common stock is registered with the sec under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
the company is subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the sec under the exchange act 
under the securities enforcement and penny stock reform act of  the company may be subject  among other things  to civil money penalties for violations of the federal securities laws 
federal and state taxation federal taxation general 
the company and the bank are subject to the applicable corporate tax provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  as well as certain additional provisions of the code that apply to thrifts and other types of financial institutions 
the following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the company and the bank 
under the applicable statutes of limitation  the company s federal income tax returns for through are open to examination by the internal revenue service the service 
the company is unaware  however  of any current or pending service examinations of the company s returns for any of those open years 
the company reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and files a consolidated federal income tax return on a december calendar year basis 
consolidated tax returns have the effect of eliminating intercompany distributions  including dividends  from the computation of consolidated taxable income for the taxable year in which the distributions occur 
bad debt reserves 
prior to  savings institutions such as the bank that met certain definitional tests primarily relating to their assets and the nature of their business qualifying thrifts were permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions thereto  which additions could  within specified formula limits  be deducted by the savings institutions in arriving at their taxable income 
for purposes of the bad debt deduction  loans were separated into qualifying real property loans which are  in general  loans secured by interests in improved real property or real property which is to be improved out of the proceeds of the loan and nonqualifying loans which are all other loans 
during  new tax legislation was enacted that repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts of qualified thrift institutions and  for years after  the bank is only eligible to claim tax deductions for bad debts under the rules for banks 
because the bank is a large bank as that term is defined in the code  it is required to compute its bad debt deduction based only on actual chargeoffs 
additionally  the new legislation required a thrift institution to recapture over a six year period its reserve as of december   to the extent it exceeds its reserve balance at december  the bank is recapturing the excess reserve of approximately  over six years 
thrift charter conversion 
the bank s retained earnings at december  included  representing that portion of the bank s reserve for bad debts for which no provision for income taxes has been made 
under legislation passed in  this amount would not be subject to federal income taxes if the bank were to convert to  or merge with  a commercial bank 
this amount would be subject to federal income taxes if the bank were to use the reserve for purposes other than to absorb losses 
distributions 
if the bank s reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans exceeds the amount that would have been allowed under the experience method and makes a distribution to the company that is considered to be drawn from its excess bad debt reserve or from the bank s supplemental reserve excess distributions  then an amount based on the excess distribution will be included in the bank s taxable income during the year of distribution 
distributions by the bank in excess of its current and accumulated earnings and profits and distributions in redemption of stock would cause a portion of the bank s bad debt reserves to be recaptured into taxable income 
however  dividends paid out of the bank s current or accumulated earnings and profits  as calculated for federal income tax purposes  will not be considered to result in a distribution from the bank s bad debt reserves 
in addition  the payment of a dividend to stockholders by the company  or the repurchase of shares of common stock by the company  would not normally cause any amount of bad debt reserve recapture at the bank s level provided that the bank s payment to the company of funds used for such purposes did not exceed the amount of the bank s available earnings and profits 
the amount of additional taxable income created in the event of a distribution by the bank to the company of an amount in excess of the bank s available earnings and profits  is an amount that  when reduced by the tax attributable to the income  is equal to the amount of the distribution 
at current corporate income tax rates this amount equals approximately of the amount of the distribution 
thus  if certain portions of the bank s bad debt reserve are used for any purpose other than to absorb qualified bad debt loans  such as for the payment of nondividend distributions with respect to the bank s capital stock including distributions upon redemption or liquidation  a portion of those distributions may be includable in the bank s gross income for federal income tax purposes 
neither the bank nor the company anticipates paying dividends or making distributions with respect to the bank s capital stock which would give rise to that type of federal tax liability 
see regulation and supervision regulation of the bank capital distributions for limits on the payment of dividends by the company 
corporate dividends received deduction 
the company is permitted to exclude from its taxable income of any dividends received from the bank  and the bank may exclude from its income dividends received from its subsidiaries pursuant to the regulations applicable to consolidated income tax returns 
the company and the bank may deduct from their income of any dividends received from an unaffiliated corporation if they own at least of the stock of the corporation 
if they own less than of the stock of a corporation paying a dividend  of any dividends received may be excluded from income 
state and local taxation the company  the bank and its subsidiaries other than cenit mortgage of north carolina are subject to virginia corporate income taxes 
the virginia corporate income tax is imposed at a rate of on the combined net income of the company  the bank and its subsidiaries other than cenit mortgage of north carolina as reported for federal income tax purposes with certain modifications 
cenit mortgage of north carolina is subject to north carolina corporate income taxes at an annual rate of on its separately computed federal taxable income with certain modifications

funds were used primarily to repay fhlb advances totaling million  to fund purchases of investment securities available for sale totaling million  and to originate loans held for sale of million 
savings institutions  such as the bank  are required to maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets equal to a certain percentage of the sum of its average daily balance of net withdrawable deposit accounts and borrowings payable in one year or less 
the liquidity requirements may vary from time to time between and depending upon economic conditions and savings flows of all savings institutions

in the event the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  the company could obtain additional advances from the fhlb 
the company could also obtain funds through the sale of investment securities from its available for sale portfolio 
market risk management the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of interest income and interest expense and the market value of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the primary goal of the company s asset liability management strategy is to maximize its net interest income over time while keeping interest rate risk exposure within levels established by the company s management 
the company s ability to manage its interest rate risk depends generally on the company s ability to match the maturities and repricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities while taking into account the separate goals of maintaining asset quality and liquidity and achieving the desired level of net interest income 
the principal variables that affect the company s management of its interest rate risk include the company s existing interest rate gap position  management s assessment of future interest rates  the need for the company to replace assets that may prepay before their scheduled maturities  and the withdrawal of liabilities over time 
one technique used by the company in managing its interest rate risk exposure is the management of the company s interest sensitivity gap 
the interest sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that time period 
at december   the company s one year negative gap interest bearing liabilities maturing within a period exceed interest earning assets repricing within the same period was approximately million  or of total assets 
thus  during periods of rising interest rates  this implies that the company s net interest income would be negatively affected because the yield of the company s interest earning assets is likely to rise more slowly than the cost on its interest bearing liabilities 
in periods of falling interest rates  the opposite effect on net interest income is likely to occur 
the interest sensitivity gap position of the company is a static analysis at december  because many factors affect the composition of the company s assets and liabilities  a change in prevailing interest rates will not necessarily result in a corresponding change in net interest income that would be projected using only the interest sensitivity gap table for the company at december  at december   the company s one year positive gap was approximately million  or of total assets 
the change in the one year gap of approximately million was primarily the result of a slower prepayment assumptions in regarding prepayment of loans which has resulted in a decrease in one year interest sensitive loans of million  b an increase in mortgage backed securities with one year interest sensitivity of million due primarily to purchases  c a decrease of million of one year interest sensitive deposits due primarily to a decrease in the outstanding balances of certificates of deposit and  d an increase of million in one year interest sensitive advances from the fhlb as proceeds were used to purchase mortgage backed certificates and a million advance moved from a fixed rate maturing in over one year to a variable rate 
the company manages its interest rate risk by influencing the adjustable and fixed rate mix of its loans  securities  deposits and borrowings 
the company can add loans or securities with adjustable  balloon or call features  as well as fixed rate loans and mortgage securities if the yield on such loans and securities is consistent with the company s asset liability management strategy 
also  the company can manage its interest rate risk by extending the maturity of its borrowings or selling certain assets and repaying borrowings 
certain shortcomings are inherent in any method of analysis used to estimate a financial institution s interest rate gap 
the analysis is based at a given point in time and does not take into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities also may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
the interest rates on loans with balloon or call features may or may not change depending upon their interest rates relative to market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features that may restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
the company is also subject to prepayment risk  particularly in falling interest rate environments or in environments where the slope of the yield curve is relatively flat or negative 
such changes in the interest rate environment can cause substantial changes in the level of prepayments of loans and mortgage backed certificates  which may also affect the company s interest rate gap position 
the methodology used estimates various rates of withdrawal or decay for money market deposit  savings  and checking accounts  which may vary significantly from actual experience 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  that are subject to repricing or that mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the table reflects certain assumptions regarding prepayment of loans and mortgage backed certificates that are outside of actual contractual terms  and are based on the prepayment experience of the company 
additionally  loans with call or balloon provisions are included in the period in which they balloon or may first be called 
except as stated above  the amount of assets and liabilities shown that reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the asset or liability

the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december   based on the information and assumptions set forth in the notes to the table 
totals as of december  are included for comparative purposes 
the company had no derivative financial instruments  foreign currency exposure or trading portfolio as of december  and the amounts included under each expected maturity date for loans  mortgage backed certificates  and other investments were calculated by adjusting the instrument s contractual maturity date for expectations of prepayments  as set forth in the notes to the table 
similarly  expected maturity date amounts for interest bearing core deposits were calculated based upon estimates of the period over which the deposits would be outstanding as set forth in the notes 
with respect to the company s adjustable rate instruments  amounts included under each expected maturity date were measured by adjusting the instrument s contractual maturity date for expectations of prepayments  as set forth in the notes 
the interest earning assets maturing in one year decreased while those maturing after five years increased at december  compared to december  this was due primarily to a decrease in the loan prepayment rate assumptions at december  prepayment rates decreased at december  due to a higher interest rate environment at the end of compared to the interest earning assets maturing in three years increased at december  primarily the result of additional investment purchases in with three year remaining maturities at the end of the average interest rate on interest earning assets decreased at december  the decrease was primarily the result of lower rates on a higher volume of mortgage backed certificates 
the interest bearing liabilities maturing in one year increased at december  as compared to a callable fixed rate advance of million  in the four year category at december   was called and converted to an adjustable rate advance at december  accordingly  the million advance moved to the one year category at december  additionally  adjustable rate advances increased at december  in order to fund the purchase of mortgage backed certificates and offset the decrease in interest bearing deposits

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as amended  the statement becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and will not be applied retroactively 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
this statement is not currently applicable to the company  because the company does not have any derivative instruments and is not involved in hedging activities 
impact of the year issue the year issue was the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  such computer programs would not recognize the correct date after december  also  systems and equipment that were not typically thought of as computer related referred to as non it contained imbedded hardware or software that may have had a time element 
in  the company implemented a four phase project of inventory  assessment  renovation and testing implementation to address the year issue 
the scope of the project included ensuring the compliance of all applications  operating systems and hardware on the mainframe  pc and lan systems  addressing issues related to non it embedded software and equipment  and addressing the compliance of the company s significant borrowers and third party providers 
as of the issuance of the company s financial statements for the year ended december   there were no year failures that have occurred with respect to the company s critical systems 
the company s significant borrowers and third party providers were not impacted by the century date change in any way that adversely affected the company 
the company estimates that total costs related to the year project were approximately  the company estimates that approximately of these costs were related to the redeployment of existing personnel to address year issues  while approximately of these costs represented incremental expenses to the company 
of the  of year project costs  approximately   and  were incurred in   and  respectively 
some computer related initiatives were delayed due to the allocation of resources towards year issues 
management believes there was not an adverse impact on the company s financial condition or day to day operations as a result of computer projects being deferred due to reallocation of resources to the year project
