superior s services assist clients to compete in the information driven economy 
through consulting  application support  outsourcing  systems integration and e commerce services  superior provides all segments of the healthcare and other industries with the tools and strategies needed to effectively serve customers and capitalize on e commerce opportunities 
the healthcare consulting segment provides information technology  as well as strategic and operations management consulting  application support  and outsourcing services to a broad cross section of healthcare industry participants and information systems vendors 
the enterprise wide communications segment assists companies in various industries  including healthcare  with network and telecommunication design and acquisition  enterprise messaging  intranet and web strategies and design  workgroup consulting  as well as software and application development solutions

the e commerce systems integration segment assists hospitals  payers  physician networks  internet based healthcare companies  and ancillary healthcare providers in developing and implementing strategic business objectives as they relate to e commerce systems integration and the efficient use of the internet in healthcare 
in  the company expands its e commerce and systems integration areas 
as healthcare and other sectors move increasingly to internet and web based technologies and applications  and as the company continues to innovate services and solutions to develop and capitalize on this growing market  the company will incur risks related to its participation in such untested opportunities in markets and quickly evolving lines of business 
such risks can include  but are not limited to  new and unforeseen technologies superseding development of the internet and or the systems integration platforms in which the company invests  the e commerce and or systems integration markets taking turns not foreseen by the company and adverse to the positioning and investments undertaken by the company  and increased competition for consultant talent in the e commerce field  increasing the company s cost of providing services 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from fees for professional services  the majority of which are billed at contracted hourly rates 
the company establishes standard billing guidelines based on the type and level of service offered 
actual billing rates are established on a project by project basis and may vary from the standard guidelines 
billings are generally contracted to be made on a bi weekly basis to monitor client satisfaction and manage outstanding accounts receivable balances 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are provided 
a portion of the company s projects are billed on a fixed fee basis  often on a monthly fee basis 
the company recognizes revenue on fixed fee projects in a manner similar to the percentage of completion basis 
as of december   the company has increased the number of projects billed on a fixed fee basis 
increased use of fixed fee contracts subjects the company to increased risks  including cost overruns 
for outsourcing engagements  the company recognizes revenue in the amount billable under the contract  which is typically billable on a monthly basis 
as of december   the company has five significant contracts to provide healthcare it outsourcing services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve profit margins on outsourcing contracts which are consistent with its historical levels of profitability 
the company s historical revenue growth is attributable to various factors  including an increase in the number of projects for existing and new clients and expanded geographic presence 
in addition  the company seeks to increase revenues by expanding its range of specialty services 
the company manages its client development efforts through several strategic services groups  each having specific geographic responsibility and focus 
the company s most significant expense is cost of services  which consists primarily of consultant salaries and benefits 
in recent years  consultant compensation expense has grown faster than consultant billing rates  resulting in an increase in the company s cost of services as a percentage of revenues 
the company foresees this trend continuing as competition for recruiting and retaining skilled consultants intensifies  particularly in the area of e commerce services 
the company has sought to address this issue by adding an additional variable portion of compensation payable upon the achievement of measurable performance goals  including practice specific and company wide revenue and earnings targets 
in addition  the company has sought to address compensation expense pressures through increased use of stock options as an overall part of its compensation package 
these efforts have been hampered recently by the impact of the company s current market price 
the company s cost of services as a percentage of revenues is also impacted by its consultant utilization 
the company attempts to optimize utilization by monitoring project requirements and timetables 
the number of consultants assigned to a project will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
project terminations  completions and scheduling delays have and can result in periods when consultants are not fully utilized 
an unanticipated termination of a significant project has and can cause the company to experience lower consultant utilization  resulting in a higher than expected number of unassigned consultants 
during  the healthcare industry experienced a slow down in consulting expenditures as fiscal constraints imposed by factors such as the balanced budget act and yk transition concerns combined forces to dampen overall industry demand for new it service consulting projects 
in addition  the company s establishment of new practice areas  lines of business  hiring of consultants in peak hiring periods and further geographic expansion have and can from time to time adversely affect utilization 
for example  the company intends to grow its e health systems integration segment to capture increased client demand expected to occur in this area  and this growth will impact utilization as these new areas come online 
also  seasonal factors  such as vacation days and total business days in a quarter  as well as the timing of the annual employees meeting have and can result in lower consultant utilization 
variations in consultant utilization result in quarterly variability of the company s cost of services as a percentage of revenues 
the company s consultants are generally employed on a full time basis  and therefore the company will  in the short run  incur substantially all of its employee related costs even during periods of low utilization  as the majority of employment costs of these personnel are fixed 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of recruiting  continuing education  marketing  facilities  administration  including compensation and benefits  outside professional fees  equipment depreciation and amortization of goodwill

the timing of revenues varies from quarter to quarter because the company s sales cycle can be relatively long and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of assignments  the general ability of clients to terminate engagements without penalty  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the timing of the establishment of new practice areas  geographic expansion and the hiring of key individuals can also have an effect on consultant utilization 
seasonal factors such as vacation days  total business days in a quarter or the business practices of clients  such as deferred commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar or the client s fiscal year  can cause the company to experience lower consultant utilization 
because a significant percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the number or size of client assignments or the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  the company s annual employees meeting  which this year is scheduled for september  can result in lower consultant utilization in the quarter in which the meeting occurs
