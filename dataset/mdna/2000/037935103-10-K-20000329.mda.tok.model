item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview applied microsystems corporation is a leader and innovator in software tools and technologies 
applied s products help customers bring products to market faster by providing innovative tools to develop  debug  and test products faster  more reliably  and at a lower cost 
the company s products have historically been targeted to meet the needs of embedded systems markets  and applied develops  markets and supports a comprehensive suite of software and hardware enhanced development and test tools for the development of complex embedded microprocessor based applications 
embedded systems are used extensively in the new internet device industry  telecommunications  internetworking  avionics  computer peripherals  office products  medical instrumentation and industrial process control 
embedded systems are also found in consumer markets such as the automotive and entertainment industries 
a wide variety of products use embedded systems  such as hand held computing devices  cellular telephones  set top boxes  automated teller machines  hospital patient monitors  airplane flight control systems  automotive braking systems  modems  facsimile machines  video games  and so forth 
the company is pursuing development efforts to leverage its expertise in traditional embedded systems markets to apply its development and performance enhancement solutions more specifically to complex internet infrastructure needs 
the company expects that traditional embedded systems tools may become the tools of choice for creating modern internet applications and establishing and maintaining internet infrastructure because these tools are uniquely suited to creating applications that are highly reliable 
such tools are also able to handle real time operating requirements and complex hardware software integration 
results of operations change from change from dollars in thousands prior year prior year net sales      the company generally recognizes revenues from product sales upon shipment  unless the company has obligations remaining under a sale or licensing agreement  in which case revenue is deferred until earned 
revenues from sales of product support contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period  which is typically months 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s net sales are presently derived primarily from sales of software design  debugging  and testing solutions  as well as product support and consulting services 
during and  the company experienced continuing declines in sales volumes of its higher priced high end emulator products as the overall market demand for this type of product decreased at a more rapid pace than anticipated 
high end debug products accounted for over of net sales in  but have since declined to less than of net sales in the company s lower priced  hardware based debug products have increased as a percentage of net sales from of net sales in to nearly of net sales in the company s new software analysis tools  including codetest and the recently released livecode products  have increased from approximately of net sales in to more than of net sales in the company s net sales also include product support revenues  which are included within the aforementioned major categories of applied s products 
these support revenues represented of net sales in  compared to in and in the decrease in net sales in as compared to was primarily attributable to a decrease in unit sales of high end debug products and decreases in unit sales of certain older lower priced debug products 
the overall lower net sales were partially offset by increased sales of software analysis tools  primarily from the codetest product line  and increased consulting revenues as the company progressed under its agreement with nintendo to provide development kits for nintendo s next generation gaming system 
applied also had improved sales in of certain lower priced debug products  including powertap  and favorable year over year currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting the dollar value of international sales 
the decrease in net sales in as compared to was primarily attributable to a decline in unit sales of high end debug products and to a lesser extent currency exchange rate fluctuations unfavorably affecting the dollar value of international sales 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in unit sales and average selling price of lower priced debug products  and to a lesser extent on increased patent license royalties and consulting services 
international sales represented of net sales in  compare to in and in in us dollars  international sales outside of north america decreased in  as compared to international sales decreased in  as compared to net sales in the decreases in and were attributable primarily to a reduction in unit sales and average selling price of the company s products internationally  particularly as the asian economies have experienced overall weakness 
the decrease in was partially offset by an increase in unit sales in europe 
applied s sales through its foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in local currencies  as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the company s reported net sales 
had the average exchange rates in remained constant from  the dollar amount of overall company net sales would have decreased instead of the reported decrease 
had the average exchange rates in remained constant from  the dollar amount of overall company sales would have decreased instead of the reported decrease 
the company is unable to predict currency exchange rate fluctuations and anticipates that such fluctuations will continue to affect its net sales to varying degrees in the future 
while international sales have decreased over the past three years in total and as a percentage of revenues  the company expects international sales to continue to account for a significant percentage of its net sales 
percentage of percentage of percentage of dollars in thousands net sales net sales net sales cost of sales    gross profit    cost of sales includes materials  labor and overhead incurred in the manufacturing of products as well as the cost of providing professional services and estimated warranty 
the company performs periodic assessments of required reserves for potential inventory obsolescence  and corresponding adjustments to such reserves are included within cost of sales 
the dollar amounts of cost of sales and gross profit fluctuate based on the volume of corresponding net sales 
overall  cost of sales and gross profit as a percentage of net sales have remained constant over the reporting periods  despite the change in product mix toward software analysis tools and lower priced debug products 
software analysis tools generally have a higher gross profit percentage than the company s traditional debug products 
however  the increased gross profit on software analysis tools was offset by additional required inventory reserves for high end inventory  the allocation of overhead expenses over a lower volume of production as unit sales have decreased  and lower comparative margins on consulting services 
the company expects its gross profit to fluctuate based upon its product mix  geographic mix  product and patent license royalties and variances in volume and related absorption of factory overhead costs 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain its recent gross profit percentages 
change from change from dollars in thousands prior year prior year sales  general and administrative expenses    the increase in sales  general  and administrative expenses in was due primarily to higher marketing expenditures incurred as the company launched its codeoptix product family  as well as certain higher personnel related expenditures 
expenses in also included accelerated amortization on certain purchased technology 
the higher overall expenses for the year were offset in part by lower sales commissions  commensurate with lower reported revenues in  as well as certain lower consulting expenses 
the decrease in in comparison to was due primarily to a reduction in foreign currency exchange losses as well as a reduction in general operating expenses 
these lower expenditure levels were partially offset by increased headcount  compensation related expenses  and promotional costs in connection with the company s expansion of its sales and marketing efforts 
the company expects its sales and marketing expenditures to increase in the future as it introduces and markets new products and continues to expand its sales  general and administrative organization 
foreign exchange gains and losses are included in sales  general and administrative expenses 
in order to mitigate certain intercompany risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations  the company at times hedges a portion of its foreign exchange risk in japan as it relates to the trade debt the company s japanese subsidiary owes to the company 
no such hedging activities were in effect during although the company may engage in exchange rate hedging activities with respect to certain exchange rate risks  there can be no assurance that it will do so or that any such activities will successfully protect the company against such risks 
change from change from dollars in thousands prior year prior year research and development expenses     the increase in research and development expenses in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to increased engineering headcount and correspondingly higher compensation related expenses 
these increased expenses were a direct result of the company s investment in strategic new initiatives  including the development of livecode  which was first commercially shipped in december livecode enables developers to trace and analyze the execution history of their application software as it is running in the target system 
this new product also gives developers the capability to interact with the program as it is being executed without interrupting execution or having to recompile the application 
research and development expenses increased in as compared to due primarily to an increase in contract labor  headcount and compensation related expenses  which were partially offset by lower prototype expenses 
the company believes that its continued investment in focused research and development activities is critical to applied s future success  and that the company s engineering resources represent a competitive advantage 
therefore  the company intends to continue to make substantial investments in product development 
these efforts may include development of software design  debugging and test tools for additional embedded microprocessors as well as continued advanced development in new products for current and new market opportunities 
as a result  the company anticipates that research and development expenses will increase in change from change from dollars in thousands prior year prior year interest income and other  net the company s interest income and other  net  decreased in in comparison to due primarily to a decrease in cash available for short term investments 
in like manner  interest income and other  net  increased in in comparison to primarily as a result of a higher level of cash available for short term investing 
income taxes as of december  the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes  both of which expire in various amounts through the utilization of some of these carryforwards is subject to an annual limit of approximately  under rules of the internal revenue code 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the corresponding financial statement amounts 
due to the uncertainty of the company s ability to utilize its net deferred tax assets  including its net operating losses and research and development credits  a valuation allowance has been established for financial reporting purposes equal to the amount of the net deferred tax assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
quarterly results of operations the company s results of operations have historically fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter  and the company expects that such fluctuations may continue as a result of a variety of factors 
these factors include the following product and price competition  fluctuating levels of internal research and development expenses  the volume and timing of customer development projects and orders  seasonality of customer orders  introductions of new embedded microprocessors  announcements or introductions of new products or technologies by the company or its competitors  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  fluctuating levels of required investments in marketing and distribution  price increases by the company s suppliers  potential parts shortages  general conditions in the company s target markets  and national and global economic conditions 
therefore  the company s quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
moreover  a significant portion of the company s quarterly net sales have historically been generated from shipments during the last few weeks of the quarter  thereby adding to the potential for future fluctuations in operating performance 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  compared to million as of december  applied maintains a revolving line of credit with a commercial bank whereby the company may borrow up to million at either the bank s prime rate or libor plus 
any such amounts borrowed would be due at the expiration of the line of credit on may  the line of credit is secured by all of the company s inventories  chattel paper  accounts receivable and general intangible assets and includes certain financial covenants 
there were no amounts outstanding as of december  nor at any time during  and applied was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants 
the company requires capital primarily for the financing of inventories and accounts receivable  sales and marketing efforts  product development activities  and capital equipment purchases 
as a result of its operating losses  applied used cash of  for operating activities in  compared to generating million cash from operating activities in and million in the company purchased  in equipment during  compared to purchasing million in and million in as of december   the company had no significant commitments with regard to capital purchases  but expects to spend approximately million in for new capital items 
the company anticipates that its annual capital needs will increase in the future as a function of replacement cycles and anticipated growth of applied s business 
the company believes that its existing working capital  together with amounts anticipated from operations and its available revolving credit line  will provide the company with sufficient funds to finance its operations for at least the next months 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including costs associated with sales and marketing programs  product development efforts  the success of the commercial introduction of new applied products  and the potential use of funds for strategic purposes 
to the extent additional capital is required  the company may sell additional equity  debt or convertible securities  or obtain additional credit facilities 
impact of year in the years leading up to the year  the company performed a comprehensive analysis of its exposure to potential year problems and took necessary action to address identified problems 
the company estimates that it spent less than  in assessing and addressing internal year issues  in addition to system upgrades that were made as part of standard system maintenance 
to date  applied has not experienced any known year issues and has been informed by material suppliers and vendors that they have also not experienced material year issues 
the company will continue to monitor its position with respect to year issues 
factors affecting future results and forward looking statements the preceding business section and other areas within this document contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the statements in this document that are not purely historical are forward looking statements 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements  but the absence of these words does not mean the statement is not forward looking 
the company cannot guarantee these statements  which are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
the company s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated due to a variety of factors  including those set forth in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this document 
the company will not update any forward looking statements due to new information  future events or otherwise 
recent operating losses 
the company s revenues declined in and  and applied incurred corresponding operating losses in both of these years 
applied put a new management team in place during and has taken steps to improve its financial performance and long term strategic direction  however  the company s future success is not assured 
rapidly changing technology 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
the company s declining sales of its high end debug products are indicative of this type of change in market requirements 
the company s future business  financial condition and results of operations will depend upon its ability to anticipate market demand for specific development solutions  develop new products and features that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices 
manufacturing and product ship schedules 
a number of the company s components are manufactured by a single source or distributed through a limited number of outlets 
the company may be unable to obtain key components in a timely manner  in sufficient quantities  or on favorable price terms 
in addition  delays in new product introductions could delay the company s expected revenue growth rates and cause its customer base to become dissatisfied and erode 
design starts 
the company s development solutions span a wide range of microprocessors  real time operating systems  and development environments 
however  a substantial decline in the number of design starts for bit or bit embedded microprocessors supported by applied  or delays by semiconductor manufacturers in the release of embedded microprocessors for which the company has developed tools  could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues 
relationship with semiconductor manufacturers 
the company s ability to provide timely new products to its customers is enhanced by applied s relationship with major semiconductor manufacturers 
with access to new embedded microprocessor technology  applied is able to adapt its tools to these new designs and make its tools available at the time the company s customers begin to incorporate the new microprocessors into their product designs 
should applied be unable to obtain timely access to new embedded microprocessor technology  the company s operating results and market share could suffer 
industry focus 
the company s sales are currently derived primarily from the telecommunications  internetworking  and avionics markets  and negative events affecting these markets could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues 
competition 
the company has historically participated in the embedded systems development tools market 
this market is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
applied has also entered into new markets  such as providing development solutions to the gaming industry through its initial agreement with nintendo 
competitors may develop and offer products and services similar to applied s current or planned product offerings 
applied s business would be harmed if the company is not able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share  any of which could harm applied s business 
the company s competitors may be able to devote significantly greater resources to marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and may expend substantially more resources on product development 
if applied is unable to compete effectively  the company s revenues and earnings may suffer 
dependence on key personnel 
the company believes that its future success will depend significantly on its ability to retain and attract key personnel and skilled employees 
there is intense competition for qualified management  engineering and sales and marketing personnel  and the company s failure to recruit  retain  and motivate such skilled employees could affect the company s ability to develop new products and increase revenues 
the company s employees are not subject to employee contracts and are free to leave at any time 
to date  the company has been successful in meeting its requirements for highly skilled sales and support personnel and research and development engineers 
however  competition for these personnel is intense and likely to become more so in the future 
management of growth 
the company seeks to grow its business by strengthening its sales and marketing programs  expanding its product lines  and providing development solutions to new markets 
such growth  if achieved  would place additional burden on management and increase the requirement to recruit and retain personnel with the right skill sets  as well as require additional infrastructure expenditures 
the company is unable to assure that it will increase its revenues  nor that it will be able to expand its management and operational infrastructure to manage such growth successfully 
intellectual property rights and litigation 
the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company also enters into nondisclosure agreements with its employees  consultants and corporate partners  and controls access to proprietary information 
litigation may be necessary in order to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect its trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company is not aware of any significant third party intellectual property rights that would prevent the use and sale of applied products  the company may unknowingly infringe the proprietary rights of others 
any infringement could result in significant liability to the company 
product liability 
the company s products and services may result in exposure to product liability claims in the event that the company s development solutions are deemed to pose a risk of injury or harm 
the company maintains product liability insurance  however  such insurance may be inadequate for all potential claims 
international operations 
a significant portion of the company s business occurs outside of north america 
economic difficulties in any of these regions  particularly in japan and europe  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
as a result of the company s international operations  the company incurs certain expenses in foreign currencies 
the company s operating results are therefore subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  which are difficult to predict 
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results and volatility of stock price 
the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis  due to a variety of factors  some of which are outside of the company s control 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company often does not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  at which time budgeted expenses have already been committed  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
consequently  purchasing or holding of the company s stock involves a high degree of risk 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk applied develops products in the united states and sells primarily in north america  asia and europe 
as a result  financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since the company s products are generally initially priced in us dollars and translated to local currency amounts  a strengthening of the dollar could make the company s products less competitive in foreign markets 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  which could adversely affect the value of the company s short term investments 
applied maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting of interest bearing securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
these securities are classified as available for sale securities 
these interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company does not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates
