write off of in process technology 
in connection with the epub acquisition  the company wrote off million of in process technology 
this amount was expensed as a non recurring charge on december   the acquisition date 
this write off was necessary because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
messagemedia is using the acquired in process technology to build future functionality into its e messaging platform and enhance its suite of services 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased in process technology into a commercially viable product principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined with the assistance of an independent valuation  by estimating the projected net cash flows related to such products  including costs to complete the development of the technology and the future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value 
the resulting projected net cash flows from such projects were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to such projects 
if these projects to develop commercial products based on the acquired in process technology are not successfully completed  the revenues and financial conditions of messagemedia may be adversely affected in future periods 
fluctuations in operating results 
the company expects to experience significant fluctuations in its future quarterly operating results 
these fluctuations will be due to several factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company  including  among others  market response to the company s messaging services  difficulties encountered in the development or deployment of products or services  including interactive messaging  difficulties encountered in acquiring and or merging with other companies or technologies  including in particular any difficulties in integrating the technology and operations of decisive and or revnet  market acceptance of internet commerce in general and the company s messaging services concept in particular  fluctuating market demand for the company s products and services  the degree of acceptance of the internet as an advertising and merchandising medium  the timing and effectiveness of collaborative marketing efforts initiated by the company s strategic partners  the timing of the introduction of new products and services offered by the company  the timing of the release of enhancements to the company s products and services  product introductions and service offerings by the company s competitors  the mix of the products and services provided by the company  the timing and rate at which the company increases its expenses to support projected growth  the cost of compliance with applicable government regulations  competitive conditions in the company s marketplace  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the fees charged by the company for advertising  messaging  and consulting services  are subject to change as the company introduces its messaging services and assesses its marketing strategy and competitive position 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
on march   the company issued  shares of its common stock in a private placement for net proceeds of approximately million 
on october   the company closed a private placement in exchange for  of newly issued shares of the company s common stock  for net cash proceeds of approximately million 
messagemedia believes that existing cash resources will be sufficient to support messagemedia s currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the end of messagemedia will need to raise additional funds through the public or private sale of its equity or debt securities or from other sources during the timing and amount of messagemedia s capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including demand for messagemedia s products and services  the need to develop new or enhanced products and services  competitive pressures and the availability of complementary businesses or technologies that messagemedia may wish to acquire 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of messagemedia s stockholders will be diluted and such equities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of messagemedia s common stock 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  will include terms favorable to messagemedia or its stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  messagemedia may be unable to develop or enhance its products or services  take advantage of opportunities or respond to competition and the nasdaq national market may choose to discontinue the listing of messagemedia s common stock 
management continues to pursue opportunities to increase its revenues and believes that the market for e messaging based services is expanding dramatically 
management believes that these efforts and its continuing efforts to raise additional capital through equity placements with existing stockholders  their affiliates or strategic partners should allow messagemedia to continue operations for the next twelve to eighteen months 
if near term revenues do not increase or if messagemedia is unable to raise additional equity  management would be required to further reduce its expenditures on research and development and general and administrative activities 
these reductions could significantly hamper messagemedia s ability to develop its messaging services
