in september  our company was created by combining citysearch  inc and ticketmaster online  then the wholly owned online subsidiary of ticketmaster corp  to create ticketmaster online citysearch 
we derive revenues from three sources online ticketing  sales of sponsorships and advertising and city guide and related services which includes online personals subscriptions 
we view our operations as being in one segment  with ongoing integration 
online ticketing operations revenues are primarily comprised of convenience charges which are charged on a per ticket purchased basis and shipping and handling fees which are collected on a per order basis 
the sale of tickets for an event often begins several months prior to the scheduled date of the event 
ticket operations revenue is recognized when the ticket is sold 
if credit card chargeback or refund activity is likely to occur with respect to an event  for example  due to the cancellation of such event  an allowance is established for potential convenience charge refunds 
merchandise sale revenues are recognized when the products are shipped 
sponsorship and advertising revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and are primarily recognized ratably over the term of the promotion 
in our owned and operated city guide markets  we derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees resulting from the creation  hosting and maintenance of local business web sites 
business customers typically enter into one year agreements that automatically convert to month to month contracts upon expiration 
we recognize revenue from sales of local business web sites on a monthly basis over the term of each contract as services are rendered 
in partner led markets  we derive licensing and royalty revenues from the licensing of our technology and business systems  from consulting services and from providing back office and hosting services 
we do not expect entering into additional domestic partnerships to launch city guides to be a critical piece of our strategy going forward 
licensing revenue under license agreements is recognized over the term of the license agreement or the period over which the relevant services are delivered for use of our business and technology systems pursuant to statement of position sop no 
 as amended by sop no 
royalty revenue is recognized as earned and is typically a percentage of partner led market revenues from web site subscriptions  banners  advertisements  sponsorships and other ancillary offerings 
additionally  we derive revenue from providing back office services  including business web site design  hosting  customer service and billing  to certain of our partners 
in our integrated personals operations  we derive subscription fee revenue from customers who subscribe for our online matching and dating services for one to twelve months 
revenues are recognized monthly over the contract term

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates
