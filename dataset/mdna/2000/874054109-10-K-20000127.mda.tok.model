our actual operating results may vary significantly from such forward looking statements 
overview our principal sources of revenues are derived from publishing and distribution operations 
publishing revenues are derived from the sale of internally developed software or software licensed from third parties 
distribution revenues are derived from the sale of third party software and hardware 
our publishing operations typically generate higher margins than distribution operations  with sales of pc software resulting in higher margins than sales of cartridges designed for video game consoles 
we recognize revenue from software sales when titles are shipped 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
our published titles are subject to return if not sold to consumers 
we establish a reserve for future returns of published titles at the time of sales based primarily on our return policies and historical return rates  and we recognize revenues net of returns 
we have historically experienced a return rate of approximately of gross publishing revenues  with less than of distribution revenues representing write offs for returns 
if future returns significantly exceed our reserves  our operating results would be adversely affected
