item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview although oil and natural gas prices increased in fiscal from the prior year  most of fiscal was characterized by reduced exploration and geophysical spending 
oil and gas companies reacted cautiously to higher commodity prices  concerned that prices would return to the much lower commodity price environment that existed during fiscal a number of oil and gas company mergers further reduced exploration and geophysical spending as the management of these companies focused on completing the mergers and were distracted away from day to day operating activities 
however  a sustained period of higher commodity prices did result in slightly higher levels of exploration and geophysical spending toward the latter part of fiscal we conduct geophysical surveys on both a contract and a multi client basis 
when operating on a contract basis  our customers purchase all rights to the completed geophysical survey  including all related data and interpretive manipulations of the data 
when operating on a multi client basis  we retain ownership of the survey and all associated data and license the survey to multiple customers 
historically  we have realized significantly higher operating margins from our multi client surveys than from surveys performed on a contract basis 
in line with current industry trends  multi client survey licensing constitutes a growing percentage of our revenues 
the licensing of multi client surveys generated of our revenues in fiscal compared to of our revenues in fiscal results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues decreased by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the general downturn in exploration spending driven by our customers concern that commodity prices would return to the low levels of prior years 
multi client revenues increased from million to million  while contract revenues decreased  from million to million 
multi client revenues as a percent of total revenues grew from in fiscal to in fiscal this reflects the trend in customer preference to obtain geophysical data through licensing rather than outright ownership 
cost of services 
cost of services decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  commensurate with the drop in revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to increased emphasis on leading edge technologies  including reservoir characterization 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of additions of geophysical and processing equipment of million during the year 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal resulting from termination costs related to the resignation of our former chief executive officer 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the issuance of million of senior notes at the end of october other income 
other income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in fiscal other income was primarily composed of net foreign currency gains of million and interest income of million as compared with interest income of million in fiscal  due to lower cash balances during the year 
income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of our lower net income and the mix between us and us source income 
equity in earnings loss 
equity in earnings loss  related to the indonesian joint venture  increased from a loss of  in fiscal to a loss of  in fiscal decreases in contract revenues and a relatively fixed cost base accounted for the decreased profitability for the year 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues decreased by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the general downturn in exploration spending driven by depressed commodity prices 
multi client revenues decreased from the prior year  from million to million  while contract revenues decreased  from million to million 
due to our increased activity in the onshore multi client business  that revenue stream increased to million from million in the previous year  somewhat offsetting the offshore multi client revenue decline 
cost of services 
cost of services decreased from million to million  but as a percent of revenues increased from to 
the increase in expense as a percent of revenues was mainly due to significant price declines in the contract business and due to fixed cost elements in cost of services 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in as a result of increased emphasis on leading edge technologies 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million to million primarily due to the million of capital expenditures over the past two years 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million to million resulting primarily from the reduction of discretionary spending at corporate headquarters 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from million to million due to the issuance in october of an additional million of the senior notes 
other income 
other income increased from  in to million in fiscal primarily due to net foreign currency losses of million in fiscal as compared with net foreign currency gains of million in fiscal interest income was approximately million in each of those years 
income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased from million to million as a result of our lower net income 
equity in earnings loss 
equity in earnings loss is related to the indonesian joint venture  which posted a loss of  for fiscal compared to a net profit of  in fiscal decreases in contract revenues and a relatively fixed cost base accounted for the decreased profitability for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources sources and uses our internal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and cash flow from operations 
external sources include public financing  equity sales  the unutilized portion of a revolving credit facility  equipment financing and trade credit 
we believe that these sources of funds are adequate to meet our liquidity needs for fiscal as of july   we had million in senior notes outstanding due in october these notes contain a change of control provision allowing them to be callable by the holder under certain conditions 
we also have a revolving credit facility due july from commercial lenders that provides advances up to million 
at july  the borrowing base exceeded the credit limit 
advances bear interest  at our election  at libor plus a margin based on certain financial ratios maintained by us or prime rate 
advances are secured by certain accounts receivable 
as of july   there were no outstanding advances under the credit facility  but million of the credit facility was utilized for letters of credit 
an additional million is available for borrowings 
we require significant amounts of working capital to support our operations and fund capital spending and research and development programs 
our capital expenditure budget for fiscal is million  which includes expenditures of approximately million to expand or upgrade current operating equipment 
we have budgeted million for research and development spending in fiscal we also have planned million additional investment in our data library measured as the change in the balance sheet account 
if demand for our geophysical technologies continues to increase  we expect to increase our expenditures and business investments in fiscal as we take advantage of opportunities to expand our business 
because of the elapsed time between survey execution  sale and ultimate cash receipt  multi client work generally requires greater amounts of working capital than contract work 
depending upon the timing of the sales of the multi client surveys and the contract terms relating to the collection of the proceeds from such sales  our liquidity may be affected 
while we seek pre funding commitments from customers for a portion of the cost of these surveys  pre funding levels do not generally affect our library spending 
we believe that these multi client surveys have good long term sales  earnings and cash flow potential  but there is no assurance that we will recover the costs of these surveys 
we will require substantial cash flow to continue operations on a satisfactory basis  complete our capital expenditure and research and development programs and meet our principal and interest obligations with respect to outstanding indebtedness 
while we believe that we have adequate sources of funds to meet our liquidity needs  our ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to many factors beyond our control 
key internal factors affecting future results include utilization levels of acquisition and processing assets and the level of multi client data library licensing  all of which are driven by the external factors of exploration spending and  ultimately  underlying commodity prices 
to ensure that we have available as many financing options as possible  we have filed a shelf registration allowing the issuance of up to million in debt  preferred stock or common stock 
on october   we filed a prospectus supplement relating to the sale of up to million shares of our common stock  from time to time through ordinary brokerage transactions  under the shelf registration 
as of august   we had issued approximately million shares in connection with these transactions  generating approximately million in net proceeds 
in addition  on september   we issued a press release announcing a proposed underwritten offering of million shares of our common stock under the shelf registration statement 
we expect to close this offering by mid october 
other since our quasi reorganization with respect to digicon inc on july   the tax benefits of net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the quasi reorganization have been recognized through a direct addition to additional paid in capital  when realization is more likely than not 
additionally  the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the quasi reorganization is subject to certain limitations 
for the year ended july   we recognized million related to these benefits  due to our uk operations increased profitability 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we receive some account receivable payments in foreign currency 
we currently do not conduct a hedging program because we do not consider our current exposure to foreign currency fluctuations to be significant 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard requires companies to record derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  as appropriate  at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
we will be required to implement this statement in our first quarter of fiscal we have reviewed the various elements of our business and determined that the implementation of this standard will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to a number of risks discussed below 
you should carefully consider these discussions of risks and the other information included in this report 
as a provider of geophysical technologies  our business is substantially dependent on the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies 
capital expenditures by oil and gas companies have tended in the past to follow trends in the price of oil and natural gas  which have fluctuated widely in recent years 
in the current period of increased oil and natural gas prices  however  capital expenditures by oil and gas companies have not increased as rapidly as we would have expected 
if there continues to be a sustained period of substantially reduced capital expenditures by oil and gas companies  such as has existed in fiscal and fiscal  the demand for geophysical technologies likely will remain low and there will be an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow during the affected period 
weak demand or technological obsolescence could impair the value of our multi client data library  changes in accounting practices could affect our methods of accounting for our multi client data library 
we have invested significant amounts in acquiring and processing multi client data and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
there is no assurance that we will recover all the costs of such surveys 
technological  regulatory or other industry or general economic developments could render all or portions of our multi client data library obsolete or reduce its value 
in accordance with industry practice  we capitalize our investments in our multi client library and charge these investments to cost of services as sales are made 
certain accounting authorities are reviewing accounting practices relating to the capitalization of expenditures made in the development of certain data bases  particularly in the context of e commerce companies 
we cannot predict whether future accounting changes could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we are dependent on achieving and maintaining technological advances  which creates risks regarding technological obsolescence  requirements for substantial future capital expenditures  the unavailability of necessary technology and the failure of new technologies 
the development of geophysical data acquisition and processing equipment has been characterized by rapid technological advancements in recent years 
we expect this trend to continue 
we will be required to invest substantial capital in the future to maintain our leading edge technology 
furthermore  manufacturers of geophysical equipment may develop new systems that render our equipment  even if recently acquired  obsolete or less desirable  requiring significant additional capital expenditures 
since some of our competitors are themselves leading designers and manufacturers of seismic equipment  we may not have access to their technology 
even if critical new and advanced equipment is available to us  we may not have funds available or be able to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms to acquire it 
further  any investment we may make in a perceived technological advance may not be effective  economically successful or otherwise accepted in the market 
we face intense competition in our industry  which could adversely affect our results 
competition among geophysical service providers historically has been  and will continue to be  intense 
competitive factors in recent years have included price  crew experience  equipment availability  technological expertise and reputation for quality  safety and dependability 
some of our competitors operate substantially more data acquisition crews than we do and have significantly greater financial and other resources 
these larger and better financed operators could enjoy an advantage over us in a competitive environment for contract awards or data sales and in the development of new technologies 
the pending combination of our two largest competitors  schlumberger s geophysical operations and baker hughes geophysical operations  will create a single very large competitor 
while we cannot predict the effect of this combination  if it is consummated  on our business or on our ability to compete successfully  the combined entity will have significant market power  which may disadvantage us 
high fixed costs could result in operating losses 
our business has high fixed costs 
as a result  downtime or low productivity due to reduced demand  weather interruptions  equipment failures or other causes can result in significant operating losses 
as technology continues to change rapidly  low utilization rates may impact our ability to recover the cost of necessary capital investments in a timely manner 
our revenues are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our control  which could adversely affect our results of operations in any financial period 
our operating results may  in the future  vary in material respects from quarter to quarter 
factors that could cause variations include the timing of the receipt and commencement of contracts for data acquisition  customers budgetary cycles  the timing of offshore lease sales and the effect of such timing on the demand for geophysical activities  seasonal factors and the timing of sales of geophysical data from our multi client data library  which may be significant to us and which are not typically made in a linear or consistent pattern 
combined with our high fixed costs  these revenue fluctuations could produce unexpected adverse results of operations in any financial period 
we may be unable to attract and retain key employees  which could adversely affect our business 
our success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel 
a number of our employees are highly skilled scientists and highly trained technicians  and our failure to continue to attract and retain such individuals could adversely affect our ability to compete in the geophysical services industry 
we may confront significant and potentially adverse competition for key personnel  particularly during periods of increased demand for geophysical services 
in addition  our success will depend to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of members of our senior management  the loss of whom could adversely affect our business 
we face risks associated with our foreign revenue generating activities 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from foreign revenue generating activities 
as a result  a significant portion of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies 
these revenues are impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  net assets reflected on the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries  and therefore on our consolidated balance sheet  are subject to currency fluctuations 
foreign revenues are also subject to special risks that may disrupt markets  including the risk of war  civil disturbances  embargo and government activities 
revenue generating activities in certain foreign countries may require prior united states government approval in the form of an export license and otherwise be subject to tariffs and import export restrictions 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties in connection with future foreign revenues and  in particular  adverse effects from foreign currency fluctuations 
we operate under hazardous conditions that subject us to risk of damage to property or personal injuries and may interrupt our business 
our seismic data acquisition activities involve operating under extreme weather and other hazardous conditions 
these operations are subject to risks of loss to property and injury to personnel from fires  accidental explosions  ice floes and high seas 
although we carry insurance against these risks in amounts we consider adequate  these events could result in an interruption of our business or significant liability 
we may not obtain insurance against all risks or for certain equipment located from time to time in certain areas of the world 
the trading price of our securities could be subject to significant fluctuations 
the trading price of our securities fluctuates 
factors such as fluctuations in our financial performance  and that of our competitors  as well as general market conditions could have a significant impact on the future trading prices of our securities 
the trading prices also may be affected by weakness in oil prices  changes in interest rates and other factors beyond our control 
these factors may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities 
our business is subject to governmental regulation  which may adversely affect our future operations 
our operations are subject to a variety of federal  provincial  state  foreign and local laws and regulations  including environmental laws 
we invest financial and managerial resources to comply with these laws and related permit requirements 
failure to timely obtain the required permits may result in crew downtime and operating losses 
because laws and regulations change frequently  we cannot predict the impact of government regulations on our future operations 
the adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of curtailing exploration by oil and gas companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our geophysical services 
certain provisions of our charter  delaware law and our shareholder rights plan may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even in situations that may be viewed as desirable by our stockholders 
the general corporation law of the state of delaware contains provisions that may delay or prevent an attempt by a third party to acquire control of us 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that authorize the issuance of preferred stock  and establish advance notice requirements for director nominations and actions to be taken at stockholder meetings 
these provisions could also discourage or impede a tender offer  proxy contest or other similar transaction involving control of us  even if viewed favorably by stockholders 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that would likely discourage a hostile attempt to acquire control of us
