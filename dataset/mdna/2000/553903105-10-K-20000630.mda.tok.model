item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements set forth below are not historical or based on historical facts and constitute forward looking statements involving known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements  expressed or implied  by such forward looking statements  including statements about the company s dependence on new products  management of growth  competition  international sales  dependence on suppliers and quarterly fluctuations 
given these uncertainties  investors in the company s common stock are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
see risk factors 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated  except for product gross profit and service gross profit  which are expressed as a percentage of the related revenue 
this information should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein fiscal year ended april  april  april  net product revenue service revenue total revenue product gross profit service gross profit gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating income other income  net equity in net loss of affiliate income tax expense benefit net income net product revenue net product revenue for fiscal year increased million  or from fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased revenue of million from server products  partially offset by decreased revenue from tape products and software products of million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year  the company s focus shifted away from resale of tape product to the sale of its own proprietary server products 
server product revenue in fiscal year from the vivant product family was million  up from essentially zero in fiscal year when the vivant product family was introduced 
the company believes that it may experience a reduction in demand from internet related businesses due to a softening in capital markets for these businesses which could negatively impact our net product revenue and results of operations 
see risk factors if there is a decrease in the demand for our products by internet related businesses  our business could materially suffer 
net product revenue in fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to decreased revenue of million from server products  partially offset by royalty revenue  tape products and software revenue increases of million  million and million  respectively  over fiscal year service revenue service revenue was million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or  from fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased revenue from maintenance contracts both domestically and in europe 
service revenue was million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to an increased volume of service contracts associated with increased product sales volume in fiscal year and a reduced warranty period on tape products effective in fiscal year product gross profit product gross profit for fiscal year was million  an increase of million  or  over fiscal year  and the product gross profit percentage of net product sales was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the increase in the product gross profit percentage is primarily due to the increase in sales of server products  which historically carry a higher margin and the impact of the introduction of the vivant product line 
product gross profit was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year  and the gross profit percentage of net product sales was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily due to reduced margins on tape products  which historically carry a lower margin 
service gross profit service gross profit percentage for fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year the gross profit percentage for service revenue was in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year this increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to increased revenue from contracts without corresponding increases in support costs 
the company expects the number of vivant units sold to increase in fiscal year due to the increased number of installed vivant units and the increased complexity of vivant products compared to previous products sold  the company intends to increase overall service and support headcount and upgrade the skills of its staff to support the more complex product 
as a result  the company expects that service cost of revenue will increase in fiscal year  which may adversely affect service gross profit 
see risk factors we may be unable to hire  retain and integrate highly skilled personnel needed to sustain our business 
service gross profit for fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year the gross profit percentage for service revenue was in fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to a higher percentage of service contract revenue for tape products which historically have a lower gross profit margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year this increase and the increase as a percentage of total revenue were primarily due to increased compensation and related costs  exclusive of commissions  of million resulting from increased headcount  increased commissions of million  increased marketing efforts of million  million of severance related costs in fiscal year and increases in other expenses of million 
effective with fiscal year  the company modified its variable compensation plan commissions and bonuses which it believes will reduce compensation expense as a percentage of total revenue 
the company believes that this reduction will be partially offset by an increase in technical sales headcount and training costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year this increase in dollars was primarily due to increased compensation related costs resulting from increased staff 
research and development expenses research and development expenses in fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year this increase is attributable to increased project costs of million  increased salary and related costs of million related to increased headcount and increased other expenses of million 
the company intends to increase its investment in research and development in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal year as it continues to expand into additional markets  such as nas storage systems 
research and development expenses in fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year research and development expenses were of total revenue in both fiscal years and other income expense  net other income expense  net  exclusive of equity in net loss of affiliate  in fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year other income expense  net  exclusive of equity in net loss of affiliate  was of total revenue in fiscal years and other income expense  net in fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year this increase was primarily due to reduced interest expense in fiscal year as compared to the prior year as a result of decreased credit line balances 
equity in net loss of affiliate equity in net loss of affiliate represents the company s proportionate share of caldera systems  inc s caldera net losses and amortization of the goodwill related to the investment made in caldera in august see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company recorded a net tax benefit of million in fiscal year this benefit is a one time benefit which is primarily a result of the reversal of valuation allowances held against certain net operating loss carryforwards 
the reversal of the valuation allowance was a result of management s determination that it was more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets would be realized based on projected financial results and available tax planning strategies 
the company recorded a net tax expense of million for fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower income for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at april  and april   respectively  an increase of million 
net operating activities provided cash of million in fiscal year  a decrease of million  primarily due to million of net income adjusted for non cash items and increases in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities of million  substantially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million as a result of increased total revenue and increased days sales outstanding  and an increase in gross inventories of million primarily due to increased revenue and an increase in product offerings 
net investing activities used cash of million due to expenditures for capital equipment of million and an equity investment in affiliate that required cash of million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million primarily due to the exercise of stock options and warrants providing cash of million  partially offset by net borrowings of million 
at april   the company s days sales outstanding were days  as compared to days at april  the company s average days sales outstanding is impacted by the high percentage of sales occurring within the last month of each quarter 
the company anticipates that its days sales outstanding will continue to be negatively impacted by this sales linearity issue 
see risk factors a significant portion of our sales occur in the last month of a given quarter and we operate without a significant backlog of orders 
consequently  our results of operations for that quarter may not meet our expectations 
effective july   the company entered into an agreement with silicon valley bank and general electric capital corporation whereby the company may borrow up to million under an asset secured domestic line of credit  limited by the value of pledged collateral 
effective july   the company renewed its agreement with silicon valley bank and general electric capital corporation 
the agreement allows the company to borrow at a rate equal to the prime rate 
borrowings under the line of credit are subject to certain financial and operating covenants  including  without limitation  various financial covenants requiring the company to maintain a minimum current ratio  debt net worth ratio  tangible net worth and level of profitability  and restricts the company from paying any dividends 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at april  the term of the agreement is for one year 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement at june  effective february   the company entered into the emc agreement selling emc substantially all of the company s existing patents  patent applications and related rights 
pursuant to the emc agreement  the company is entitled to receive million over the life of this agreement  in six equal annual installments of million each 
the company has received five of the six installments 
the sixth and final payment is due january the company will also receive royalty payments in the aggregate of up to a maximum of million over the term of the emc agreement 
as part of the maximum million of royalties  minimum royalties of million will be received in five annual installments  beginning within thirty days of the first anniversary of the effective date of the emc agreement  and within thirty days of each subsequent anniversary thereof 
the first four annual installments were received in march  march  march and march also  pursuant to the terms of the emc agreement  million of the maximum million of royalties  will be received in five equal annual installments as a result of a computer and technology agreement between emc and ibm announced in march the first annual installment was received in march the emc agreement provides that the remaining four payments will be received annually beginning in march management believes that the company s working capital  bank lines of credit and cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet the company s operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months  however  in the longer term  the company may require additional funds to support its working capital requirements including financing of accounts receivable and inventory  or for other purposes  and may seek to raise such funds through public or private equity financing  bank lines of credit or from other sources 
the company s current line of credit agreement will expire july  the company has begun negotiations for a renewal of its existing credit facility and believes the company will be able to secure comparable financing prior to the expiration of the existing credit facility 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or  if available  will be on terms favorable to the company 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  hedging activities and exposure definition 
sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings  or reported in other comprehensive income until the hedge is recognized in earnings 
in june  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
was issued 
the statement defers the effective date of sfas no 
until the first quarter of fiscal year in june  sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
was issued 
although the company continues to review the effect of the implementation of sfas no 
and no 
 the company does not currently believe their adoption will have a material impact on its financial position or overall trends in results of operations and does not believe adoption will result in significant changes to its financial risk management practices 
however  the impact of adoption on the company s results of operations is dependent upon the fair values of the company s derivatives and related financial instruments at the date of adoption and may result in more pronounced quarterly fluctuations in other income and expense 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the objective of this sab is to provide further guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry 
the company is required to follow the guidance in the sab no later than the first quarter of its fiscal year the sec has recently indicated it intends to issue further guidance with respect to adoption of specific issues addressed by sab no 
until such time as this additional guidance is issued  the company is unable to assess the impact  if any  it may have on its financial position or results of operations 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the definition of employee for purposes of applying accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
this interpretation is effective july   but certain conclusions in this interpretation cover specific events that occur after either december   or january  we believe that the impact of fin will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
inflation and foreign currency exchange inflation and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s results of operations in the past 
there can be no assurance  however  that they will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in future periods 
year issue the company completed its review of year issues as scheduled and believes all of its critical systems are year compliant 
however  there can be no assurances that the company has tested and identified all potential year issues including the impact of outside parties on the company s operations 
as of june   the company had not experienced any significant issues in relation to the year issue in both its internal infrastructure as well as its products 
additionally  the company has not been made aware of any significant year issues experienced by its customers or third party vendors 
the company will continue to monitor year issues throughout calendar with a focus on those dates impacted by the year issue 
the company has incurred costs consisting primarily of internal labor costs that are considered to be immaterial 
any additional costs  which are considered primarily internal labor costs  are anticipated to be immaterial 
risk factors the non historical information in this form k constitute forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to our future plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
these statements may be identified by the use of words such as believes  expects  may  will  should  seeks  anticipates  intends  plans and similar expressions 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these statements 
the sections entitled risk factors  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business contain a discussion of some of the factors that could contribute to those differences 
factors that could contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k 
a significant portion of our sales occur in the last month of a given quarter and we operate without a significant backlog of orders 
consequently  our results of operations for that quarter may not meet our expectations 
we have historically experienced a significant portion of our orders  sales and shipments in the last month or weeks of each quarter 
we expect this pattern to continue  and possibly increase  in the future 
this uneven pattern makes our ability to forecast revenues  earnings and working capital requirements for each quarter extremely difficult and uncertain 
it has also increased our days sales outstanding and is expected to continue to do so 
for example  at april  our days sales outstanding were and at april  our days sales outstanding were if we do not receive orders that we have anticipated or complete shipments within a given quarter  our results of operations could be materially harmed for that quarter 
in addition  we operate without a significant backlog of orders 
as a result  our quarterly sales and operating results in any given quarter are dependent  in large part  upon the volume and timing of orders booked and products shipped during that quarter 
accordingly  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unanticipated decrease in our orders  sales or shipments 
therefore  any decline in the demand for our products and services  in relation to our forecast for any given quarter  could materially harm our results of operations 
the success of our business depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 
we believe that the development and introduction of new  innovative products with features that respond to our customers changing demands and incorporate new technological standards will be critical to our future success 
we may not be able to design and manufacture products that address customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
any significant delay or failure by us to design  manufacture and successfully introduce new products could materially harm our business 
our ability to successfully introduce new products depends on several factors  including timely completion of product design  achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields  and market acceptance 
we face additional risks inherent in new product introductions  including competitors responses to our product introductions  pricing pressures from competitors products  difficulties in forecasting customer demand  the desire by customers to evaluate new products for longer periods of time  and unanticipated development problems or delays 
these risks may result in unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention or the abandonment of the development of a specific product 
in addition  we may not be able to effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies  which could materially harm our business 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive which may lead to reduced sales of our products  reduced profits and reduced market share for our business 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
if we fail to maintain or enhance our competitive position  we could experience pricing pressures and reduced sales  margins  profits  and market share  each of which could materially harm our business 
our customers requirements and the technology available to satisfy those requirements are continually changing 
therefore  we must be able to respond to these changes in order to remain competitive 
the principal elements of competition in our markets include ability to introduce new technology  product quality  reliability and performance  quality of service and support  and responsiveness to customer and market needs 
we have a number of competitors in various markets  including emc  hewlett packard  sun microsystems  ibm  compaq and network appliance  each of which has substantially greater name recognition  engineering  manufacturing and marketing capabilities  and greater financial  technological and personnel resources than we do 
our systems are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors that could be difficult  costly and time consuming to repair 
undetected software or hardware errors frequently occur in networking products when they are first introduced or as new versions of products are released 
our systems are complex  and from time to time we may find errors in our existing  new or enhanced products 
in addition  our systems are combined with products and components made by other vendors  and if errors occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
these errors  whether caused by our or another vendor s products  could adversely affect sales of our products  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts  cause significant customer relations problems  harm our competitive position  hurt our reputation  and cause purchase delays 
any of these effects could materially harm our business or results of operations 
we may be unable to hire  retain and integrate highly skilled personnel needed to sustain our business 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to hire  train  motivate and retain additional personnel  particularly those in sales  marketing and engineering 
competition for these people is intense 
if we are unable to attract or retain qualified people in the future  or if we experience delays in hiring required personnel  our ability to develop  introduce or sell our products could be materially harmed 
in addition  if we are unable to retain our current employees  or any future employees  our business or results of operations could be materially harmed 
we are dependent on limited source suppliers for principal components used in our products  and disruptions in supply or significant increases in component costs could materially harm our business 
for our vivant product line  we currently purchase disk drives solely from seagate  chipsets solely from qlogic  host bus adapters solely from jni  emulex and sun microsystems  and fibre channel switches solely from ancor communications  inc disruptions in supply or significant increases in the component costs from these vendors could materially harm our business and our results of operations 
we order components and materials based on rolling forecasts which could cause us to overestimate or underestimate our actual requirements 
this could cause us to increase our costs or prevent us from meeting customer demand 
we use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our component requirements 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms and current market demand for such components 
as a result  our component requirement forecasts may not be accurate 
if we overestimate our component requirements  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate our component requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to our customers 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and results of operations 
our quarterly results may fluctuate from period to period 
therefore  historical results may not be indicative of future results or helpful in evaluating the results of our business 
we have experienced quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate that these fluctuations may continue in the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  and may continue to be caused by  a number of factors  including changes in demand for our vivant line of products and services  the introduction of new products by our competitors and competitive pricing pressures  the timing of customer orders  the timing of the introduction of new products and new versions of our products  shifts in our product mix  the timing of sales  marketing  research and development expenditures  and decreases in our gross profit as a percentage of revenues for mature products 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
we cannot assure you that we will remain profitable on a quarter to quarter basis or that our future revenues and operating results will meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  any of which could cause a significant adverse change in the trading price of our common stock 
if there is a decrease in the demand for our products by internet related businesses our business could materially suffer 
in fiscal year  we derived a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of our products to internet related businesses 
any decrease in the growth of the internet  in the demand of our products by internet related businesses or in the financial resources available to internet related business to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to financial and operating risks associated with international sales 
international sales represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
for example  international sales represented of our total sales for fiscal year if we are unable to maintain international market demand for our products  our results of operations could be materially harmed 
our international business is subject to the financial and operating risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  fluctuating exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  export restrictions  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection and longer payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  and potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
all of our sales in international markets are priced in the applicable local currency and are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we currently enter into foreign currency exchange contracts on a limited basis in an attempt to minimize foreign currency exposure  which can be costly or limited in their effectiveness 
if we are faced with significant changes in the regulatory and business climate in our international markets  our business and results of operations could suffer 
in the future  we may expand our international presence in other markets which may require significant financial and managerial resources 
in addition  expansion into new international markets may involve additional risks  including uncertainty of market acceptance of our products due to language  cultural or other barriers  and differences in technologies and computing infrastructures needed to utilize our products and services 
if our international expansion efforts do not yield anticipated levels of sales  our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 
we depend upon our key personnel 
we believe that our success is dependent  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team  particularly our executive officers 
the loss of services of our executive officers could materially harm our business 
the failure to retain key members of our senior management team  or to implement a succession plan to prepare qualified individuals to join us upon the loss of a member of our senior management team  could materially harm our business 
if we are unable to comply with evolving industry standards and government regulations we may be unable to sell our systems or be competitive in the marketplace 
our systems must comply with current industry standards and government regulations in the united states and internationally 
any new products and product enhancements that we introduce in the future must also meet industry standards and government regulations at the time they are introduced 
failure to comply with existing or evolving industry standards or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could materially harm our business 
in addition  such compliance may be time consuming and costly 
our systems integrate san and nas technologies into a single storage architecture 
components of the san and nas must comply with evolving industry standards 
we depend on companies that provide other components of the san and nas to also meet these standards 
if our vendors or customers do not support the same industry standards that we do  or if competing standards emerge that we do not support  market acceptance of our products could suffer 
our intellectual property is critical to our business and  if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  the success of our business and our results of operations could be materially harmed 
our intellectual property includes patents  proprietary technology  trade secrets  copyrights and trademarks 
we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws and employee and third party non disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights 
third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights  and we may be unable to detect this unauthorized use or effectively enforce our rights 
any legal action that we may bring to protect our intellectual property rights could be expensive and distract our management from day to day operations 
in addition  the laws of some countries in which we sell our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the united states 
unauthorized use or misappropriation of our intellectual property could materially harm our business 
we may face costly damages or litigation costs if third parties claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights 
our business activities may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  and other parties may assert infringement claims against us 
in addition  in the future  we may receive communications from other parties asserting that our intellectual property infringes on their proprietary rights 
if we become liable to any third party for infringing its intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay substantial damage awards and to develop non infringing technology  obtain licenses or cease selling the applications that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we could have to redesign our products  which could be costly and time consuming and could substantially delay product shipments  assuming that a redesign is feasible 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and any outcome unfavorable to us could materially harm our business 
furthermore  we could incur substantial costs in defending against any intellectual property litigation  and these costs could increase significantly if any dispute were to go to trial 
our defense of any litigation  regardless of the merits of the complaint  will likely be time consuming  costly and a distraction for our management personnel 
adverse publicity related to any intellectual property litigation could also harm the sale of our products and damage our competitive position 
our stock price may be volatile  which could lead to losses by investors and to securities litigation 
the value of your investment in our common stock could decline due to significant volatility caused by variations between our actual and anticipated earnings  the timing and announcement of new products by us or our competitors  services or technological innovations by us or our competitors  failure of our results of operations to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community  speculation in the press or investment community about our business or competitive position  the volume of trading in our common stock  and market conditions broadly and the trading price of shares of technology companies generally 
our stock ownership is concentrated in a single stockholder  and other stockholders may not be able to influence corporate decisions 
raymond j 
noorda  our chairman of the board  is also the chairman of the board of our largest stockholder  the canopy group  inc canopy 
canopy beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock and is able to substantially affect our actions which require stockholder approval  including the election of the board of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of us and will make some transactions difficult or impossible without his support 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could affect the price of our common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain various provisions  including notice provisions  provisions for staggered terms of office of the board of directors  and provisions authorizing us to issue preferred stock  that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or may discourage acquisition bids for  our company 
in addition  the rights of holders of our common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future that would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock 
furthermore  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law regulating corporate takeovers 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company s european operations transact in foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the british pound sterling and the euro 
the company has and may continue to utilize hedging programs  currency forward contracts  currency options and or other derivative financial instruments commonly used to reduce financial market risks  none of which were outstanding at april  there can be no assurance that such actions will successfully reduce the company s exposure to financial market risks 
the company maintains a million credit line 
the interest rate applied to any debt outstanding under this credit line is equal to the prime rate and is  therefore subject to a certain amount of risk arising from fluctuations in these rates 
however  we believe that a increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations
