item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion includes forward looking statements about the demand for our products and future results 
please refer to forward looking statements section of this form k 
overview demand for our geophysical products is dependent upon the level of world wide oil and gas exploration and development activity which is dependent  primarily  on oil and gas prices 
oil and gas prices have been subject to wide fluctuations in recent years in response to changes in supply and demand 
despite the recovery in oil commodity prices in late and early  producers concern over the sustainability of these higher prices had the effect of lower exploration budgets by oil producers which resulted in weak demand for our geophysical equipment 
other factors that negatively impacted our fiscal sales have been mergers among oil producers  weakened financial condition of some of our customers and oversupply of seismic data and seismic equipment on the market 
despite the higher oil and gas prices it is expected that the return to normal levels of purchases of geophysical equipment by seismic contractors might occur later than for other parts of the oil service industry 
acquisitions in january  we completed the acquisition of custom products 
custom products is a manufacturer of miniature industrial clutches  brakes and sub fractional horsepower electric motors sold under the polyclutch and polyvolt tradenames 
the purchase price of the assets acquired totaled  and consisted of  in cash   shares of common stock valued at  acquisition costs of  and contingent cash payments 
such contingent cash payments could total  and are dependent on annual increases in the net sales of custom products for the period january  to december  any contingent cash payments will be capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the goodwill 
in april  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of a g geophysical products  inc a g manufactures underwater electrical connectors and cables  air gun signature hydrophones and pressure transducers used in the marine seismic industry 
the purchase price totaled  and consisted of  in cash  a note to the selling shareholder for   shares of common stock valued at  and acquisition costs of  liquidity and capital resources at june  we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
for the year ended june   we generated  of cash from operating activities principally resulting from net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization 
these sources of cash were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and income taxes payable 
for the year ended june   we used  of cash for capital expenditures 
we estimate that our capital expenditures for fiscal will be  which we expect to fund through operating cash flow 
we used  for financing activities for the year ended june  principally for the repayment of  of the debt issued for the a g acquisition 
we will use  in fiscal for debt repayment which we expect to fund from operating cash flow

at june  we had  of cash and cash equivalents 
for the year ended june  cash generated from operating activities was  principally resulting from net income of  and a  decrease in accounts receivable 
for the year ended june  we used  of net cash for the a g acquisition and  for capital expenditures 
at june  we had  of cash and cash equivalents 
for the year ended june  cash provided by operating activities was  principally from net income of  and an increase in accounts payable of  the cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a  increase in accounts receivable 
for the year ended june  we used  of net cash for the custom products acquisition and  for capital expenditures 
in we used  for financing activities which consisted of  repayment of long term debt offset by  of borrowings under our line of credit 
we have a  unsecured bank credit facility which matures in available borrowings under the terms of the agreement decrease by  each year 
any borrowings under the agreement bear interest at the prime rate 
there are no borrowings outstanding under this agreement at june  as discussed above  as part of the consideration for the acquisition of a g geophysical  we issued a  note 
the note bears interest at payable monthly and requires quarterly principal payments of  the note has a final maturity in april we have pledged the assets and common stock of a g as collateral for the note 
under the terms of the january asset purchase agreement for custom products  we may be required to make maximum additional payments to its former owners of  if net sales of custom products increase to certain levels by december  we were not required to make any additional payments at december  or because custom products sales did not reach the agreed upon amounts 
we own a one half interest in our administrative and engineering building located in norwalk  connecticut through a joint venture agreement 
the agreement expired in july under the terms of the agreement  we can purchase the one half interest owned by its joint venture partner  estimated at approximately  we are currently exploring various alternatives with our joint venture partner 
in october  the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which we were authorized to buy up to  shares of common stock in open market or private transactions 
we will use our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances for the repurchase of any shares 
to date  we have not repurchased any shares under the program 
current cash and cash equivalent balances  existing borrowing capacity and projected cash flow from operations are currently considered adequate to meet foreseeable operating needs 
we believe that inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our revenues and profitability

results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  the consolidated statement of income includes the results of operations for a g for all of fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal sales for the year ended june  decreased  or from the year ended june  sales of marine air guns and replacement parts decreased  primarily as a result of the sharp decline in seismic vessel construction and the oversupply of equipment in the market place 
this decrease was partially offset by the inclusion of a g for all of which increased sales by  and a  increase in sales by custom products 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was for fiscal and for fiscal the effect of lower operating efficiencies from the decreased demand for marine air guns and replacement parts was the primary cause for the increase in the cost of sales percentage 
research and development costs remained essentially unchanged from last year 
we completed the final development and testing of our new marine air gun in the last quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expense increased  from fiscal to fiscal the inclusion of a g for all of added  to expense and additional marketing costs at custom products for new product introductions increased expenses  partially offsetting the added selling  general and administrative expense from a g and custom products was a  decrease in incentive compensation expense 
amortization of intangibles increased  because a g was included for all of we are amortizing the goodwill relating to our acquisitions over twenty years 
interest expense for fiscal increased  over fiscal because the note issued for the a g acquisition was outstanding for the entire fiscal year 
interest income decreased  in as compared to because we used our short term investments in late to finance a portion of the a g acquisition 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal was  an effective tax rate of 
this amount is higher than the federal statutory rate of principally because the amortization of the goodwill from the a g acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes and the effect of state income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal was  an effective tax rate of 
this was lower than the federal statutory rate because of the utilization of previously reserved net operating loss carry forwards 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  the results of operations of custom products are included in the consolidated statement of income from january  the results of a g are included in the consolidated statement of income from april sales for the year ended june  were  an increase of  or from  for the year ended june  the increase in sales was primarily attributable to the inclusion of custom products in the results of operations for all of fiscal which increased sales by  and the inclusion of a g for the fourth quarter of which increased sales by  partially offsetting these increases was a  decrease in sales of marine air guns and replacement parts 
factors that caused this decrease were the deterioration in late item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d 
results of operations cont d 
and the first part of of oil and gas prices which resulted in significant reductions in exploration spending 
in addition  the consolidation in the oil and gas industry delayed a number of exploration projects decreasing the demand for the company s geophysical products 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in reduced purchases of auxiliary equipment required for marine air gun systems caused the reduction in the cost of sales percentage 
auxiliary equipment has lower margins than our proprietary marine air guns and replacement parts 
research and development costs increased  as we increased our efforts to develop a new marine energy source 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  the inclusion of custom products for all of caused  of the increase and the inclusion of a g from april represented a  increase 
partially offsetting these increases was a  decrease in incentive compensation expense 
amortization of intangible assets primarily goodwill associated with the acquisition of custom products and a g amounted to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal we are amortizing the goodwill related to these acquisitions over years 
interest expense increased from  in to  in the increase in interest expense represents amounts paid in connection with the  note issued for the acquisition of ag 
interest income increased from  in to  in because of higher average balances of short term investments during the provision for income taxes for was  an effective tax rate of 
this provision reflects the benefit of  of previously reserved deferred tax assets realized during the year 
the provision for income taxes in includes a  benefit from the reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets
