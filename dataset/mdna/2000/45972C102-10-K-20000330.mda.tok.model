item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this overview contains forward looking statements that include  but are not limited to  the company s expectations regarding its future financial condition and operating results  product development  business and growth strategy  market conditions and competitive environment 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors disclosed in this document 
since its incorporation in november  the company s operations have been concentrated in acquiring its proton linear accelerator linac and related assets  redesigning and reconfiguring the linac for production of radioisotopes  developing production methods  acquiring land  designing and constructing facilities for the production and distribution of radioisotopes  radiopharmaceuticals and brachytherapy products  raising capital  selling certain accelerator components and excess equipment and entering into strategic alliances with medical and pharmaceutical companies  universities and other institutions 
during  we concentrated our efforts on making a successful transition from a development stage enterprise to an operating manufacturing company with a focus on finished radiopharmaceuticals 
the steps needed to make this transition proved to be more costly and complex than we had anticipated  causing us to miss many of our milestones 
as the year progressed we found it necessary to make strategic changes in our structure and plans 
some of those are described below o the company and its board of directors recognized the need to restructure and enhance executive management to ensure that they were providing the skills appropriate for the situation 
david m 
camp  ph 
d  who possesses a background in chemical engineering and extensive experience in the management of technology companies and manufacturing operations  assumed the roles of president and chief executive 
o william nicholson  a member of the board of directors since march of  assumed the position of chairman of the board  a position previously occupied by ira morgan  phd mr 
nicholson  formerly the chief operating officer of amway company  has been an active supporter of international isotopes inc  providing guidance  advice and financial assistance when necessary 
o we realigned the responsibilities of senior staff to shift to a more product oriented focus and assigned specific employees to be responsible for all key aspects of advancing particular products to the marketplace 
o during  the regulatory quality assurance organization increased its depth of experience by adding additional key personnel and technical staff 
alan johnson  who has a masters degree in microbiology and years of experience in the radiopharmaceutical manufacturing industry  joined us as director of regulatory affairs 
the fda audited our operations and the results were satisfactory 
we received several observations which were subsequently cleared within days 
several customers  including imagyn and neorx also audited our facility 
these results were also satisfactory and we met or exceeded their requirements 
an additional k for our brachytherapy seed product with the fda 
we also submitted a dmf for the manufacture of thallium to the fda 
key validations were successfully completed and significant efforts expended to support our customer s pending snda filing 
o we continued efforts to modify the linac for commercial application and on may  achieved proton energy levels of million electron volts mev 
however  our progress slowed during the balance of the year as we dealt with many technical issues 
we have experienced many problems that were inherent in the original design of the linac as created for the ssc project 
as a consequence  the challenges to bring the linac into regular operation were more complicated than originally estimated  however  we continue to believe that it has the potential to be the most potent  cost effective and adaptable commercial radioisotope production system in the united states 
although the commissioning phase of the installation has taken longer than planned  we are currently successfully completing target runs  have produced commercial quantities of thallium and believe that the linac will achieve production levels necessary to produce sales revenues originally forecast for this year 
o although the linac is designed to achieve a maximum proton energy level of mev and a beam intensity of milliampere  about five times the beam intensity of most commercial cyclotrons  we plan to operate a minimum of one year at an energy level of mev 
at this level  the linac can produce all the radioisotopes we have forecast for sale in the next two years 
the modified linac is designed to irradiate up to six targets simultaneously  with each target  if required  producing a different radioisotope 
we are currently operating on the first two target stations and will be adding additional stations over the balance of the year as required 
o we continued to operate the mev cyclotron accelerator for planned production of iodine  flourine and limited amounts of thallium radioisotopes 
our efforts last year related to the cyclotron  which is leased from the university of north texas  were concentrated on installing the necessary production capability  demonstrating optimum production parameters  achieving regular runs and recruiting and training operators 
o i began commercial production of i brachytherapy seeds in small quantities in late we realized that we would need to develop more robust processes to scale up from small production quantities into large commercial mass production of the brachytherapy seed product 
for the past eighteen months  the company has had a team of scientists and engineers designing and building state of the art robotic manufacturing facilities using automation techniques similar to those of the semiconductor industry 
by building inspection and quality checks into the robotic processes  we believe we are creating the necessary manufacturing methods to insure quality products while increasing manufacturing efficiency and decreasing labor costs 
another issue  especially important during the current tight labor market  is that the automated processes reduce the level of skill required to operate the manufacturing line 
the end result of the automated manufacturing facilities will be a lower cost  higher quality product which we believe will translate into a significant competitive advantage 
the first units of robotics manufacturing completed process qualifications early in and installation of the next wave is underway 
we are continuing the ramp up to allow us to manufacture large scale commercial quantities of seeds with additional capacity being added to meet future marketing requirements 
o as we entered the final phases of construction on the linac and the cyclotron  we added personnel to our radiochemistry department and completed the purchasing and installation of the necessary equipment 
the process of locating and employing personnel with radiochemical skills and experience was also difficult and time consuming 
we continue to face challenges in the recruiting area 
during the latter part of and early  we have concentrated resources in developing the processes related to the radiochemical separation process  especially in production of radioisotopes like iodine during october we entered into an agreement with neorx corporation to design the commercial manufacturing process line for their skeletal targeted radiotherapy product str for the treatment of multiple myeloma 
this was an important achievement for us  we plan to use this as a model for other commercialization projects for the development of finished radiopharmaceuticals 
in february  we announced that neorx had awarded us the contract to be responsible for all aspects of the manufacturing of this product 
as part of the agreement  neorx will provide  to fund process qualification  quality control  packaging and shipping as well as provide the materials for phase iii clinical trials 
the company s subsidiary  international isotopes idaho inc  completed the year with several significant events 
we were able to establish three year minimum quantity sales agreements for iridium we believe these sales agreements will generate a per year increase in the volume of iridium sales 
in addition  we were able to expand our positions in the advanced test reactor from to positions to support the growing volume of bulk radioisotope sales 
an additional objective we achieved was to support initiating the production of more value added products by starting two multi year contracts for the production of sealed source devices  implementing cgmp for the production of pharmaceutical grade radiochemical sr and source recovery co recycling 
the company has obtained various permits from the texas department of health bureau of radiation control tdh brc to use sources of radiation 
these include radioactive material licenses a to manufacture and distribute radiochemicals and radiopharmaceuticals and to perform acceptance testing on the cyclotron and associated components  and b to develop imaging systems  registrations to a perform acceptance testing on the linac and associated components and facilities  and b operate various lasers  and a radioactive sealed source and device ssd registry sheet for the iodine brachytherapy source 
the ssd registry sheet is required for regulatory agencies to authorize medical facilities to receive and use the iodine brachytherapy source 
in addition  the company has received a k from the fda to allow medical use of the iodine brachytherapy source and has received permits from the tdh bureau of food  drug and medical devices to manufacture and distribute medical products in texas

interest expense decreased during due primarily to an increase in the amounts capitalized 
the company capitalized interest costs of  in and  in liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations since inception primarily by private placements of equity securities  its initial public offering  loans from stockholders and directors and bank loans 
during the third quarter of  the company completed its initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately  in october  texas state bank in mcallen  texas provided financing which allowed the company to pay off all existing loans real estate loans and to consolidate its remaining financing into a  loan 
the texas state bank loan includes i a fifteen year amortization and a five year term loan with a floating interest rate which adjusts every six months on may and november of each year and ii a  line of credit collateralized by accounts receivable of less than days 
during  texas bank funded an additional  in lease financing for the purchase of equipment 
the company was not in compliance with several of the restrictive covenants of the texas state bank loan 
the company has obtained a waiver of the technical violations  which included the deferral for one year  from to  of a minimum revenue covenant 
based on the company s current projections  it believes that it will be able to comply with the minimum revenue covenant in from december through february we closed a private placement of securities resulting in additional equity of  in and  through february  net of commissions and fees 
in april the company initiated a private placement of securities resulting in additional equity of  net of fees 
in may of we completed an offering of non voting  redeemable  convertible  preferred stock with a coupon  which was funded in may and october with proceeds of  net of fees 
in february we completed a private placement of common stock for proceeds of  net of fees 
under the terms of the may redeemable preferred stock purchase agreement  the company has a capital call option which commits the investment banker to fund up to an additional  for additional redeemable preferred stock 
although we are currently in production and generating revenues from the sale of several products  we will continue to have a negative cash flow at least for the short term  if not longer 
our progress to breakeven operations will be dependent on numerous factors  including increasing our production of radioisotopes  radiochemicals  and medical devices as well as moving steadily forward in the development of commercial processes for finished radiopharmaceutical products for our customers 
we will continue to incur significant expenses in maintaining a competent manufacturing staff  satisfactory regulatory and quality organizations  a skilled  certified engineering staff as well as the other project development and material costs necessary for production 
we anticipate we are still several years away from achieving the production levels necessary to produce the expected economies of scale 
the company s history of operating losses has resulted in continued dependence upon additional external financing 
management s plans regarding its liquidity involve the successful execution of its business plan  including the successful commercialization of the company s products 
the company intends to obtain additional capital necessary to fund operations  complete the commissioning of the linac  and meet debt service requirements  from public and private sales of equity or debt securities 
the company anticipates  based on the execution of its business plan and its continued capital raising activities  that it will have sufficient funds to finance its operating activities for at least the next twelve months 
in the event the company is unable to secure sufficient funds  the company s operations and business expansion would be significantly curtailed 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional financing or obtain financing on terms acceptable to the company

the provisions of this statement are now effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june   although early adoption is allowed 
we plan to adopt the provisions of this sfas on january  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its long term debt 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates to variable rate loans that are benchmarked to us bank prime lending rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage overall borrowing costs or reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
the impact on the company s borrowing costs and cash flows of a one point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of the variable rate debt as of december  would be approximately
