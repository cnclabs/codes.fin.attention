d property operating results and trends aggregate tenant sales volume over the long term  the level of anchor and mall shop tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the company as anchor and mall shop tenants provide over of total revenues and because tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of tenant sales are considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs 
total reported sales for all tenants that reported sales for the applicable years are shown below in millions anchors owned locations    mall shop tenants  excluding freestanding  theater  and supermarkets  the above data excludes sales from all seasonal and temporary tenants who generally do not report their sales to the company 
the company owned of anchor store locations at december  in a period of increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of declining sales  rents on new leases tend to grow more slowly 
however  revenues generally increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
average base rents per square foot for mall shop tenants at quarter end for the last three years are shown in the following table 
the increase in average base rent during these three years results primarily from renewing existing leases at higher base rents  from leasing vacant space at higher base rents  and from elimination of lower paying tenants that closed during these periods 
march june september december comparable mall store sales and occupancy cost management believes that over long periods of time the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
occupancy costs are comprised of base fixed rents  percentage rents  and expense recoveries pro rata share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance and other costs pertaining to the property 
because most mall shop tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable is a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
while such increased occupancy costs as a percentage of sales cannot grow indefinitely for any one tenant  management believes that it is possible to increase the percentage paid by all tenants as a group by aggressively working to replace under performing tenants with better performing ones 
comparable mall store sales per square foot in each reporting period is based on sales reported by mall store tenants excludes anchors and certain other large space users that occupied space in both the current and immediately preceding reporting period 
comparable mall store sales per square foot for the last three years are set out below 
also shown below is the percentage of mall shop tenants occupancy costs as a percentage of their annual sales 
comparable mall store sales per square foot occupancy cost percentage at period end seasonality and occupancy the enclosed shopping mall industry is seasonal in nature  with anchor and mall shop tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school events 
while minimum rents and expense recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  many leases are scheduled to expire in the first calendar quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter 
the aggregate mall shop occupancy percentage  defined as the ratio of total mall shop space that is leased including both tenants occupying space and tenants that have signed leases but have not yet taken occupancy to the total mall shop space gross leasable area gla at quarter end for the last three years is set out below 
mall shop occupancy march june september december at december   anchor occupancy was and total portfolio occupancy anchors  mall stores and freestanding was

general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased by million in over a year ago primarily as a result of reductions in employee census that occurred in connection with restructurings in during the first and third quarters of  the company recorded restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  related to severance and related costs for employees affected by two reductions in the number of corporate office staff together with reductions in other corporate office related expenses 
the restructurings involved approximately thirty five home office employees who were terminated and who represented a cross section of management  clerical  and secretarial employees 
the restructuring costs are shown as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations 
the amount remaining to be paid at december  was approximately million  and is included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
it is expected that most of the remaining liability that exists at december  will be paid out in interest expense interest expense net of capitalized amounts for was million  a million increase over the increase was comprised primarily of million associated with debt incurred to purchase the recently acquired properties  and million coming from increased borrowings related to existing centers

change in accounting method for percentage rent on may  the emerging issues task force eitf discussed issue accounting for contingent rent and reached a consensus that lessors should defer the accounting recognition of contingent rent  such as percentage rent  until the specific tenant sales breakpoint target is achieved 
on november   the eitf rescinded its consensus reached on may  on december   the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition which essentially affirmed the accounting method for contingent rents that the eitf had initially adopted on may  during the third quarter of and prior to the eitf s rescission on november   the company implemented the may  eitf consensus as a change in accounting method and accordingly recorded as of january  a million cumulative effect adjustment representing the change in prior years percentage rent income based on the new method of accounting 
the impact on percentage rent income of the new method for the year ended december  was a reduction of percentage rents of about  from what would have been reported under the company s previous method of accounting 
the company s previous accounting method  which was fully acceptable under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  recognized percentage rent on a pro rata basis when a tenant s achievement of its sales breakpoint was considered probable 
the impact on the fourth quarter of was an increase in percentage rent of approximately  over what would have been reported 
the impact on the previously reported first  second  and third quarters of was immaterial 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the fasb has approved statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which amends statement to be effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  had the company applied this standard currently  the effect on the company s financial position and results of operations for the year ended december  would be immaterial 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
 to provide guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
specifically  sab no 
provides guidance on lessors accounting for contingent rent 
sab no 
explains the sec staff s general framework for revenue recognition 
sab no 
does not change existing literature on revenue recognition  but rather clarifies the sec s position on preexisting literature 
sab no 
did not require the company to change existing revenue recognition policies and therefore had no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations at december  accounting for minority interest minority interest represents the common partnership units in the operating partnership that are owned by crown investments and its subsidiary 
at december  crown investments and its subsidiary owned  common partnership units  or of the total common partnership units out standing 
crown american realty trust owns the remaining 
the minority interest balance is adjusted each year for crown investments and its sub sidiary s proportionate share of net income loss of the operating partnership after deducting preferred unit distributions  common partnership distributions  and additional capital contributions 
primarily because the common partnership distributions have been larger than the operating partnership s income loss after preferred unit distributions  the minority interest account on the consolidated balance sheet has been declining each year 
based on current trends  the balance will be reduced to zero in under generally accepted accounting principles  when and if the minority partner s share of the operating partnership s net income loss and the minority partner s cash distributions and capital contributions  would cause the minority interest balance to be less than zero  such balance must be reported at zero unless there is a legal obligation of the minority partner to reimburse the operating partnership for such excess amounts 
the partnership agreement does not provide for any such obligation by the minority partner 
accordingly  when the minority interest account is reduced to zero  the minority partner s share of income and loss and cash distributions  net of its capital contributions  must be charged for financial reporting purposes against the company s share of earnings  as the general partner 
subsequently  any future positive amounts representing the minority partner s share of the operating partnership s income and loss and cash distributions net of capital contributions would be credited in full to the company s share of earnings to the extent such amounts were previously charged against the company s earnings 
this accounting method will not impact the cash flows of the company or the cash distributions made to shareholders or to the minority partner 
this accounting method is expected to reduce reported net income and net income per share in periods after the minority interest account is reduced to zero 
however  funds from operations as an operating performance metric is not expected to be affected

liquidity and capital resources the company has significant ongoing capital requirements 
the company believes that its cash generated from property operations and funds obtained from property financings and general corporate borrowings will provide the necessary funds on a short term and long term basis for its operating expenses  debt service on outstanding indebtedness and recurring capital expenditures and tenant allowances  and all dividends to the shareholders necessary to satisfy the reit dividend distribution requirements under the internal revenue code see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company intends to pay regular quarterly dividends to its shareholders 
however  the company s ability to pay dividends is affected by several factors  including cash flow from operations  capital expenditures  and its ability to refinance its maturing debt as described below 
dividends by the company will be at the discretion of the board of trustees and will depend on the cash available to the company  its financial condition  capital and other requirements  and such other factors as the trustees may consider 
sources of capital for non recurring capital expenditures  such as major building renovations and expansions  acquisitions  and for balloon payments on maturing outstanding indebtedness  are expected to be obtained from additional company or property financings and refinancings  sale of non strategic assets  additional equity raised in the public or private markets  and from retained internally generated cash flows  or from combinations thereof 
given the company s current level of indebtedness  and given the uncertainties concerning future equity and debt capital markets and interest rates  there is no assurance that the company will be able to secure such future infusions of equity and or debt financing and refinancings when needed  or at rates or terms that will permit the company to use the proc eeds raised to increase earnings or funds from operations 
the company has commenced construction of an expansion and redevelopment of washington crown center and an expansion at valley mall 
the total cost of the two projects  including capitalized construction overhead  interest  and tenant allowances  are estimated at million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  had been incurred as of december  in addition to amounts incurred at december   the company is committed for future payments under various construction purchase orders and certain leases 
the company has obtained a million construction and three year permanent bank loan for the washington crown center expansion and redevelopment  the loan bears interest at libor plus  and million was borrowed and outstanding as of december  the valley mall expansion is being financed under the line of credit with general electric capital corporation as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
also  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  on august  the company closed a million year mortgage with general electric capital corporation gecc 
the gross proceeds from the new loan the gecc mortgage loan were used to refinance the million kidder mortgage loans  the million interim mortgage loan see below  and the million secured term loan 
the remaining proceeds were used largely to establish escrows to fund the remaining expansion and redevelopment costs of patrick henry mall and nittany mall  and to fund closing costs  initial loan reserves and prepayment penalties with respect to million of the kidder mortgage loans and the million secured term loan that were pre paid prior to their maturity dates 
the prepayment penalties for the kidder mortgage loans and the million term loan were approximately million 
in addition  approximately million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the kidder mortgage loans and the million interim mortgage loan were written off 
both of these items were accounted for as an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
the gecc mortgage loan has a fixed stated interest rate of and is secured by cross collateralized mortgages on of the malls 
the loan provides for payment of interest only during the first two years and interest and principal amortization  based on year amortization  during the last eight years 
in connection with the gecc mortgage loan  in november  the company made a million interest bearing good faith deposit with gecc  and in july and august  the company made million in non interest bearing rate lock deposits with gecc 
these deposits were refunded at closing 
as of december   the scheduled principal payments on all outstanding debt are million  million  million  million  and million for the years ended december  through  respectively  and million thereafter 
the company expects to refinance or extend the majority of the maturities over the next five years through additional company financings and from refinancing the maturing loans 
the company s ability to refinance or extend these loans on or before their due dates depends on the level of income generated by the properties  prevailing interest rates  credit market trends  and other factors that may be in effect at the time of such refinancings or extensions and there is no assurance that such refinancings or extensions will be executed 
the ratios of the company s ebitda to interest paid on total indebtedness exclusive of capitalized interest and interest income for the years ended december    and were to  to  and to  respectively 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  crown investments and its subsidiary have been granted rights  subject to certain restrictions  whereby they may redeem part or all of their common partnership units for common shares  on a one to one basis  or cash at a price equal to the value of the company s common shares 
crown investments has pledged substantially all of its limited partnership units as collateral for a loan it has received from an unrelated third party 
g economic trends because inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years it has had little impact on the operations of the company during this period 
tenant leases also provide  in part  a mechanism to help protect the company during highly inflationary periods 
as operating costs increase  most leases permit a pass through of the common area maintenance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes and insurance  to the tenants and therefore  the tenants will absorb part of this increased operating cost 
most of the leases provide for percentage rent after a certain minimum sales level is achieved 
thus  during highly inflationary periods  when retail sales at the malls increase  the company should receive additional rental income through percentage rent increases  partially offsetting the effect of inflation 
the use of the internet for retail sales is growing rapidly  but at present is a very minor component of total retail sales distribution in the united states  and particularly of the types of products typically sold in enclosed regional malls 
management of the company does not foresee that internet retailing will have a significant effect on tenant sales or occupancy levels in the foreseeable future 
year in and management actively assessed the company s exposure to the so called year problem which relates to the ability of electronic equipment  computer hardware and software to properly recognize  use and process date sensitive information on and after january  the company replaced certain equipment that was not year compliant  modified and tested various computer programs  and developed extensive contingency plans should year problems occur 
the total cost  excluding internal salary related costs  of the company s year initiatives was approximately million 
the company has experienced no significant problems with its systems and equipment to date related to year and does not believe that any significant year related problems will occur in the future 
the company has also not experienced any problems whereby its vendors or customers have been unable to complete transactions successfully with the company due to their year problems 
however  it is possible that such problems by vendors and customers may manifest themselves in the future and adversely impact the company 
h forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities act of  as amended 
such statements are based on assumptions and expectations  which may not be realized and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  many of which cannot be predicted with accuracy 
future events and actual results  financial and otherwise  may differ from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
risk and other factors that might cause differences  some of which could be material  include  but are not limited to  economic and credit market conditions  the ability to refinance maturing indebtedness  the impact of competition  consumer buying trends  financing and development risks  construction and lease up delays  cost overruns  the level and volatility of interest rates  the rate of revenue increases versus expense increases and financial stability of tenants within the retail industry  as well as other risks listed from time to time in the company s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission or otherwise publicly disseminated by the company 
although management believes that the assumptions made in connection with the forward looking statements are reasonable  there are no assurances that the assumptions and expectations will prove to have been correct due to the foregoing and other factors 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk accounts receivable and accounts payable carrying amounts approximate the fair value of the accounts receivable and accounts payable balances  respectively  at december  in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect interest costs associated with million of variable rate debt  which represents of total long term debt  and costs when refinancing maturing fixed rate debt 
the following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates dollars in millions year ending december  and thereafter long term debt fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate interest rate risk for the company increased in due to an increase in variable rate debt from million at december  to million at december  the company s variable rate debt is based primarily on libor  and the company will incur increasing interest costs if libor increases 
the company may enter into interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate such risks in the future  but as of december   the company has no such instruments outstanding
