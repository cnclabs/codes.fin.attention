item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting matters during the third and fourth quarters of  changes in the business activities of the company  together with a newly effective accounting standard  caused the company to modify certain of its practices regarding recognition of revenue and costs related to sales of capacity 
none of the accounting practices described below affect the cash flows of the company 
as a result of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 real estate sales  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which became effective july   revenue from terrestrial circuits sold after that date has been accounted for as operating leases and amortized over the terms of the related contracts 
previously  these sales had been recognized as current revenue upon activation of the circuits 
this deferral in revenue recognition has no impact on cash flow 
with the consummation of the frontier acquisition on september   service offerings became a significant source of revenue 
consequently  the company initiated service contract accounting for its subsea systems during the fourth quarter  because the company  since that date  no longer holds subsea capacity exclusively for sale 
as a result  since the beginning of the fourth quarter  investments in both subsea and terrestrial systems have been depreciated over their remaining economic lives  and revenue related to service contracts have been recognized over the terms of the contracts 
revenue and costs related to the sale of subsea circuits have been recognized upon activation if the criteria of sales type lease accounting have been satisfied with respect to those circuits 
during the fourth quarter  the company s global network service capabilities were significantly expanded by the activation of several previously announced systems  and by the integration of other networks obtained through acquisition and joint venture agreements 
with this network expansion  the company began offering its customers flexible bandwidth products to multiple destinations  which makes the historical practice of fixed  point to point routing of traffic and restoration capacity both impractical and inefficient 
to ensure the required network flexibility  the company is modifying its standard capacity purchase agreement forms and its network management in a manner that will preclude the use of sales type lease accounting 
because of these contract changes  and the network management required to meet customer demands for flexible bandwidth  multiple destinations  and system performance  the company anticipates that most of the contracts for subsea circuits entered into after january  will be part of a service offering  and therefore will not meet the criteria of sales type lease accounting and will be accounted for as operating leases 
consequently  revenue related to those circuits will be deferred and amortized over the appropriate term of the contract 
in certain circumstances  should a contract meet all of the requirements of sales type lease accounting  revenue will be recognized without deferral upon payment and activation 
the company notes that accounting practice and authoritative guidance regarding the applicability of sales type lease accounting to the sale of capacity is still evolving 
based on the accounting practices described above  the company believes that additional changes  if any  in accounting practice or authoritative guidance affecting sales of capacity would have little or no impact on its results of operations
