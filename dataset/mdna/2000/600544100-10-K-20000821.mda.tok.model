item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis the issues discussed in management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation when considering year over year growth statistics  it is important to keep in mind that fiscal year contained weeks  compared to weeks in fiscal and forward looking statements this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as other sections of our form k  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act  as amended  that are based on management s beliefs  assumptions  current expectations  estimates  and projections about the office furniture industry  the economy  and about the company itself

furthermore  herman miller  inc  undertakes no obligation to update  amend  or clarify forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
overview we had a record setting year at herman miller in a number of categories  including sales  orders  backlog  and earnings per share 
while all of these critical measures improved  we did not achieve our goals for sales and net income growth 
our results were impacted by three primary factors a general industry slowdown  manufacturing inefficiencies  and the decision to continue investing in our key strategic initiatives 
the decline in industry demand  which fell short of expectations  began to affect our order entry in the third quarter of fiscal and impacted our financial results in the first half of fiscal in addition  net income growth was restricted as a result of our strategic investments 
while it would have been possible to increase earnings by reducing our strategic investments  such a decision would have delayed critical development of new products and processes that will enhance the value we deliver to customers 
we believe that the rapidly changing dynamics in the office furniture industry have led to a stratification of buyer attitudes we characterize as value propositions  groups of customer needs we are dedicated to serving 
we also believe that creating a customer centered business is extremely dependent upon developing customized portals and other forms of connectivity that utilize the rapidly evolving technology being deployed in the emerging business to business and business to customer paradigms 
earnings per share in dollars to meet these challenges  companies must deploy new functionality  to be a leader  the deployment must be rapid 
over the past two years  we have made a commitment to our customers  our vendors  our business partners  and ourselves  to reinvent our industry 
completely changing how we interact with all of these groups is no small task  a fact we have recognized since we began this effort 
we do believe  however  that the results will be more than worth the investment in capital  expenses  time  and even delayed earnings growth 
we have already realized tangible benefits from this work  as will be evidenced throughout this discussion 
although we also faced challenges this year that were not anticipated in our initial plans  we believe we are developing holistic solutions that further enhance our value proposition approach 
as mentioned in the letter to shareholders  innovation demands investment 
we made substantial investments in our business during fiscal these took the form of expanded facilities and equipment  increased operating expenditures  and additional personnel 
our investments were in four primary areas development and implementation of our customer centered technology platform  consolidation of our georgia  us operations into a new facility  production capability enhancements  and new products 
as we expected  capital expenditures increased to million 
our operating expenses increased million  or percent 
our design and research expenditures increased approximately percent 
these investments are core building blocks that will enable us to implement our strategy  get connected  and change the game in the office furniture industry 
at herman miller  we use economic value added eva to measure the value we have created for our employee owners and shareholders 
we evaluate all of our business decisions using this metric  to ensure that we are applying our resources to those opportunities that create the highest return 
we also use eva as the basis for calculating our incentive compensation 
making eva such an important part of our overall compensation structure has driven a much higher level of business literacy throughout our workforce  providing better decision making throughout the company 
eva declined by million in fiscal for several reasons we will elaborate upon throughout this discussion 
because of this decline  incentive compensation payments were reduced substantially from last year 
in essence  having a percentage of our compensation vary based on eva simulated an across the board pay cut of million 
prior to the eva implementation  we would have been forced to undergo sizeable terminations to experience the same results 
our employees obviously suffered  but our belief in the future is so strong that continuing to invest in our strategy was the most effective way we could continue to create value 
in addition to the remarkable improvement in business literacy  we have derived substantial benefits from the system as a whole 
we continue to believe that eva is the best method of rewarding our employees in a manner that is consistent with the rewards we provide to our shareholders  and market research validates this perspective 
while eva has not predicted short term swings in our stock price  since its implementation  our stock price has increased percent  while eva grew percent 
we continue to believe that there is a strong correlation between stock price and expected eva 
therefore  again this year  we have presented a summarized calculation of our eva for fiscal   and in addition  we have noted throughout our analysis the impact that changes in performance had on eva 
calculation of economic value added in millions operating income interest expense on noncapitalized leases goodwill amortization other increase decrease in reserves capitalized design and research adjusted operating profit cash taxes net operating profit after taxes nopat weighted average capital employed weighted average cost of capital cost of capital economic value added imputed interest as if the total noncancelable lease payments were capitalized 
the reported current tax provision is adjusted for the statutory tax impact of interest expense 
total assets less noninterest bearing liabilities plus the lifo  doubtful accounts  and notes receivable reserves  warranty reserve  amortized goodwill  deferred taxes  and capitalized design and research expense 
design and research expense is capitalized and amortized over years 
management s estimate of the weighted average of the minimum equity and debt returns required by the providers of capital 
reevaluated every year and adjusted when necessary to reflect the current rate environment and capital structure 
as you can see  we generated million of eva this year  compared to million last year  and million in in  our eva decreased percent after increasing percent in eva in millions key drivers net sales in fiscal  our sales increased percent  after increasing percent in  and percent in our goal continues to be percent per annum sales growth  throughout this discussion  we will identify growth drivers for the upcoming year that we believe will help us approach that level 
net sales in millions as discussed above  demand was soft during the first half of our fiscal year 
this was primarily due to concerns over a possible recession and customers postponing capital spending to address year yk 
demand improved strongly in the second half of the fiscal year for two reasons 
one  corporate profits continued to be strong  which eased recession fears 
two  pent up demand created by yk was released 
additionally  our international markets were positively impacted as the economic environments where we have a presence also rebounded during the year 
each of these topics is expanded upon below 
domestic operations our domestic sales grew percent this year  after growing percent in  and percent in excluding acquisitions and the extra week in fiscal  our domestic sales increased percent in  percent in  and percent in in the current year  we acquired geiger brickel  inc  to complement our product offerings 
our core domestic growth has been primarily driven by unit volume increases 
we have not materially changed list prices in over four years 
during  incremental discounts given to customers reduced our net sales by approximately million 
changes in discounts reduced net sales in by million and were not significant in domestic sales growth as a percent bifma herman miller the business and institutional furniture manufacturers association bifma reported that us sales grew approximately percent in the months ended may  after increasing percent in  and percent in given that our growth has exceeded the industry s growth  we believe we have gained market share in each of the past five years 
we believe demand for office furniture in the us is driven by three primary factors in the macro economy corporate profits  white collar employment  and nonresidential fixed investments 
during the last three fiscal years  each of these factors improved year over year 
secular trends  such as the deployment of technology into work environments and new and emerging work styles  have also positively influenced demand in recent years 
over the past year  industry growth has not correlated well with these drivers 
we believe the recession fears and yk disruption mentioned above caused this 
also  our industry has historically lagged behind changes in the macro economy by approximately six months 
this is demonstrated by bifma s sales growth  which was percent during the first half of our fiscal year  and percent during the second half 
bifma is currently estimating that industry shipments will increase to percent in calendar  and to percent in calendar international operations and exports from the united states we are delighted with the results of our international operations  which  for the first time ever  generated positive eva 
this is also the third consecutive year that international operations positively impacted consolidated results with continued growth in sales  orders  and profitability 
net sales of international operations and export sales from the us for the year increased percent in to million  compared with million last year  and million in this year  our international sales have been positively impacted by improving economic conditions in the geographic areas where we have a significant presence  particularly the united kingdom and japan 
as is the case domestically  the increases are primarily attributable to unit volume changes 
international net sales in millions net income for was million  versus million last year and million in all regions reported net income 
these positive results are primarily attributable to increased sales growth and cost containment efforts 
the percent increase in current year profitability was the result of creating an infrastructure with sufficient capacity to provide increased throughput without substantially increasing costs  thereby providing strong operating margins on incremental sales 
gross margin consolidated gross margin  as a percent of net sales  decreased to percent for the year  compared to percent in the prior year  and percent in certain expenses were reclassified as operating expenses to conform to industry reporting 
we have restated all years presented to reflect this change 
gross margin as a percent of net sales four primary factors are responsible for the decline in gross margin deeper discounting  product mix shifts to newer products with lower margins  the ramp up of new products  and manufacturing inefficiencies 
these unfavorable factors were partially offset by an improvement in per unit material costs and a reduction in our incentive compensation 
these incentives are available to all employees and are tied to year over year improvement in eva 
as discussed above  during the first half of our fiscal year  industry demand was relatively soft 
in this environment  competition was heightened  as companies were willing to accept reduced pricing to utilize excess capacity 
as we moved into the second half of our fiscal year  demand strengthened and pricing stabilized  however  it stabilized at the pricing levels we experienced during the first half of the year 
as was noted above  the increased discounting reduced sales and gross margin million  which resulted in a 
percent decrease in gross margin 
we have invested in developing and enhancing production capabilities for several new products  most notably q tm  passage tm  and resolve tm systems 
these products are currently generating lower margins than our more established product lines 
we are continuing to invest in these products to improve their manufacturability 
as the impact of these investments takes hold and volume increases  we expect the margins to improve 
we have been implementing lean manufacturing techniques throughout our operations for the past several years  and have realized substantial benefits from this work 
these techniques are a process of continuous improvement that focuses on the elimination of waste in all aspects of our business 
to further accelerate these benefits  we are strengthening our relationship with the toyota supplier support center to develop a dedicated team whose sole function is the implementation of the herman miller production system 
we believe that continuation of this work will enhance our throughput and productivity  improve our cost structure  and enable us to achieve our reliability goals 
as part of our focus on reliability  we increased our investment in working capital 
our efforts to improve our production capabilities reduced our manufacturing flow predictability for a period of time 
as we worked toward reducing cycle times  the process changes we implemented caused fluctuations in production and shipping schedules 
to eliminate the impact this had on customer shipments  we changed our internal scheduling to ensure that manufacturing of orders was completed to allow adequate time for staging and shipping 
a result of this change is that we have significantly increased our shipment reliability  which has consistently been over percent since the third quarter 
while the change in internal scheduling led to a slight increase in our working capital  we believe it is the right answer for our customers 
at the end of  the days sales outstanding in the sum of our accounts receivable and inventory had increased to days  compared to days and days at the end of and  respectively 
as you can see  we have maintained a large portion of the gains realized in previous years 
these improvements are the result of faster cycle times  improved connectivity with our vendors  and eliminating steps in the physical distribution process 
we expect that continued increases in throughput will further improve this turnover rate during fiscal to support our customer focused vision  we require absolute reliability from our supply base 
our operation is very strongly aligned with our suppliers  and as we increase our customers expectations regarding speed and reliability  providing suppliers with accurate  real time information becomes essential 
the work to accomplish these objectives is proceeding on several fronts  with the primary focus on technologically enabling the process  which we believe is the only way to be cost competitive while attaining the new  required levels of performance 
we have developed internet based capabilities for selected suppliers on a customized web site  allowing them to have the latest material requirements whenever they want it 
during fiscal  over percent of our material requirements were filled utilizing this capability 
raw material purchases represent percent of our cost of goods sold 
by keeping our vertical integration to a strategically determined level  we are better able to increase the variability of our cost structure 
we are also able to utilize the capabilities of our supply base to their fullest extent  which provides greater flexibility in selecting new materials and processes in the research  design  and development of new products 
as we invest in our supplier relationships  both technologically and developmentally  our suppliers have reciprocated by partnering with us  sharing both their expertise and cost savings created 
our material cost improved by approximately million in and million in as a direct result 
over the past year  we have continued the implementation of our enterprise resource planning erp system in most of our us operations 
our internal expertise is developed to the point that we have been able to nearly eliminate the need for external consulting resources  dramatically reducing the ongoing implementation cost 
we now have six west michigan manufacturing sites implemented on the new system with minimal  if any  disruption to the operations 
we have also focused on improving our reliability and quality  while reducing lead times 
we believe this focus has paid off  making us a leader in the industry and exceeding customer expectations  as our implementation has provided faster and more accurate data regarding the operations and material planning needs 
our previous estimate for the total project cost of million has not changed 
we expect to implement the new system at the majority of our manufacturing sites over the next months 
during fiscal  we expect gross margins to remain in the range of to percent of net sales 
continued productivity improvements and material cost reductions will be offset  to some degree  by additional discounting and the resumption of incentive compensation payments to north american employees 
operating expenses during the past two years  we invested heavily in two primary areas technology and new products 
we believe that leadership in the office furniture industry will be determined by those organizations that provide high speed  seamless  on demand communications throughout the value chain that begins and ends with the customer 
further  these tools must be customized into a specific business model that fits the individual customer s needs  not be one size fits all 
we have developed four distinct value propositions  which are tailored to types of customers  based on how they perceive value 
in each of these models  customization opportunities are available to further enhance the customer s experience 
central to all of these capabilities  however  is our understanding of customers expectations based on their input 
it is important to note that customers have ready access to any of the tools deployed throughout the suite of competencies and methods that compose our value propositions 
essentially  customers can select the means by which they communicate with us  across a spectrum of interaction levels and contact points that range from placing orders through our online store at www 
hermanmiller 
com  utilization of a custom designed web site  or engaging our design team to implement a fully realized environment 
as we stated in the overview  creating real value for customers also relies heavily on the product offering 
over the years  herman miller has continually led the office furniture industry in product and business design innovation 
elsewhere in this report you can see some of our major milestones 
during fiscal we renewed our commitment to developing leading edge products that  by their nature  enhance work environment productivity 
this was demonstrated by the product offering displayed in our neocon showroom  which won the grand award for best showroom this year 
the other area of incremental expenditure was design and research 
design and research costs  excluding royalty payments  were million in  compared to million in  and million in royalty payments made to designers of the company s products as the products are sold are not included in research and development costs  since they are considered to be a variable cost of the product 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development costs were percent in  percent in  and percent in as discussed earlier  new product design and development has been  and continues to be  a core value of herman miller 
the increased expenditures are directly related to the increased number of new products introduced and currently in development 
also  several products moved from development to commercialization  driving increased marketing costs 
the market response to our new products has been exceptional 
in particular  our award winning resolve system has made a significant impact on customers perceptions about office environments and how they impact a company s image and culture 
we introduced resolve at the industry s annual trade show  neocon  in june of  where it won a best of show gold award 
during fiscal  we focused on establishing production  and commercializing this product 
in june of  the resolve system became available for unrestricted order entry 
although it is still quite early for resolve  we believe that it will set a new reference point for office furniture environments in its flexibility  approach to privacy  cost  and presentation and utilization of space 
in addition to these areas  we had incremental operating expenses from acquisitions completed during fiscal   and  and increases in wages and benefits for the existing work force of approximately percent 
the improvement in our operating expense ratio to percent in as compared to percent in was primarily due to reduced variable incentive compensation payments  which responded to the decline in eva 
once again  we restated all years for reclassification of certain expenses from cost of goods sold 
operating expenses as a percent of net sales our long term goal is to reduce operating expenses to percent 
however  we expect this ratio may increase slightly next year 
as is the case in gross margin  continued improvements and leveraging of the cost structure will be offset by increases for incentive compensation payments 
while we are diligently pursuing initiatives to further improve our cost structure  we will improve this ratio primarily by increasing sales at a higher rate than costs 
our operating expense improvement trend has slowed over the past two years 
as we have discussed throughout this report  the deployment of technology has been and will continue to be a key focus for us 
to support this work  we have increased the size and expertise of our information technology staff 
this year  the team was focused on implementing our new erp system and upgrading our information technology infrastructure 
we expect our information technology costs to remain consistent with fiscal levels for the foreseeable future 
we believe that most companies who lead their industry also lead in the deployment of technology 
our investments in both our erp platform and customer focused sales capabilities will continue to be primary drivers of our cost structure 
this is due both to the ever increasing importance of these investments as well as the rapidity with which they change 
historically  capital investments were amortized over an extended period of time 
in the new  technology driven business model  however  capital investments impact the income statement much more quickly  driving higher expense levels and greater needs for renewed assets 
operating income the decline in gross margin was partially offset by the reduction in the operating expense ratio  resulting in a slight decline in operating margin 
as a percent of sales  operating income declined to percent in from percent in  and was consistent with the percent in operating income as a percent of net sales other expenses and income other expense was million in fiscal  while in we generated other income of million 
the change is primarily attributable to increased debt and the impact of nonproductive asset disposals 
throughout this document  we have discussed how we are investing in the business 
we are also optimizing our capital structure with an appropriate mixture of debt and equity capital  by continuing our share repurchase program 
to fund these and other investments  interest bearing debt has increased  driving interest expense to million  as compared to million last year 
at the end of fiscal  interest bearing debt was million  an increase of million from fiscal we disposed of several nonproductive assets in the current year  which generated a pre tax loss of million for the year 
last year s results included gains on the sales of our sites in grandville  michigan  and roswell  georgia  as well as excess land in chippenham  uk in total  these disposals contributed a net million pre tax gain to prior year s results 
income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in  compared to percent and percent in and  respectively 
the lower tax rate is due to lower state taxes  international tax benefits  and other initiatives 
we expect the effective tax rate for fiscal to be in the range of to percent 
liquidity and capital resources the table below shows certain key cash flow and capital highlights dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents cash from operating activities days sales in accounts receivable and inventory capital expenditures debt to ebitda ratio 


ebitda to interest expense ratio eva capital nopat to eva capital our cash flow from operations decreased percent in  to million  from last year s million 
the decrease from last year was due to an increased working capital investment of million 
as noted earlier  the working capital increase was due in part to manufacturing inefficiencies 
days sales outstanding in the total of accounts receivable and inventory increased days 
during the fourth quarter  we were able to reduce the level of investment as shipment velocity  coupled with operational improvements  improved our turnover rate 
cash flow from operating activities in millions fiscal capital expenditures were primarily for investments in our customer centered selling technology platform  new facilities  construction of the new plant in georgia  and equipment for operational enhancements to expand capacity 
at the end of the fiscal year  million of capital was committed for future expenditures 
during  we completed the sale of our manufacturing site and excess land in roswell  georgia  a building in grandville  michigan  and excess land in the united kingdom 
total proceeds from the sale of these properties were million 
the grandville site is no longer needed and will not be replaced 
the georgia facility was replaced by a new facility that was completed in the new facility enabled us to consolidate the operations performed at our roswell site with operations performed at two leased locations  thus lowering our total operating costs and providing increased capacity 
we expect capital expenditures  net of redeployments  will be between million and million in the largest planned expenditures will be for continued development of our e business initiatives  and manufacturing capabilities to support product lines that will drive our growth in the upcoming year 
in  we acquired geiger brickel  inc  a manufacturer of wood casegood products 
included in this purchase was a geiger brickel sales office in the united kingdom 
we also acquired a privately owned north american dealer as part of our service strategy 
these organizations were acquired for approximately million and  shares of herman miller stock 
we expect to invest between million and million in acquiring additional local and regional service operations in in addition  we will continue to investigate acquisitions and alliances to fill strategically identified gaps in our product offering 
at the end of  we continued to have a high level of cash and cash equivalents 
we intend to utilize our available cash to partially fund the repurchase of the company s stock  acquisitions  and future capital expenditures 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed a million shelf registration that will enable us to undertake an initial public debt offering to replace currently amortizing fixed rate debt and existing variable rate debt 
in addition  the shelf registration provides us with flexibility as potential new financing needs arise 
our available credit  combined with our existing cash and expected cash flow  is adequate to fund our day to day operations  strategic investments  and share repurchases 
in  we renegotiated the covenants on existing debt and obtained a new million unsecured revolving credit facility 
going forward  our capital structure will be managed based on one overriding tenet we will maintain the financial strength and flexibility that would enable our debt to be rated investment grade  including the maintenance of a minimum ebitda to interest expense ratio and a maximum debt to ebitda ratio 
ebitda stands for earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation  and amortization

the board of directors first authorized the company to repurchase its common stock in  and has periodically renewed its authorization 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million under the board approved stock repurchase program 
over the past five years  we have repurchased  shares of our common stock for million  adjusted for stock splits in fiscal and this represents approximately percent of the common shares outstanding at the end of management and the board of directors believe the share repurchase program is an excellent means of returning value to our shareholders and preventing dilution from employee ownership programs 
in september  our board of directors approved an additional million  and in july  they approved an additional million to be used for share repurchases 
we currently have million remaining on our authorization 
total cash returned to shareholders in millions total return to shareholders as a percent herman miller s p over the years  we have developed a variety of ways for our employees to buy and hold shares of stock in herman miller  inc in june we awarded an option to purchase shares of stock to each of our non executive  north american employees who were with the company for the entire fiscal year 
the purpose of this special one time grant is to provide our employees with a greater share of the value created by their hard work and by substantial investments we made during fiscal we have always believed that employees who are also owners are better employees and are more likely to create economic value in the business 
contingencies the company  for a number of years  has sold various products to the united states government under general services administration gsa multiple award schedule contracts 
the gsa is permitted to audit the company s compliance with the gsa contracts 
at any point in time  a number of gsa audits are either scheduled or in progress 
management had been notified that the gsa referred an audit of the company to the department of justice for consideration of a potential civil false claims act case 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the justice department informed the company that the audit has been returned to the gsa without the filing of a civil false claims act case 
management does not expect resolution of the audits to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
we are not aware of any other litigation or threatened litigation that would have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
conclusion in conclusion  the office furniture industry is in a period of rapid  fundamental change  and we are determined to lead the way 
as we have described our strategic intent to you throughout this document  we hope that you have a better understanding of how we are creating new value for our shareholders and employee owners 
breaking new ground is always a higher risk approach than following the pack  but we believe our approach safeguards the company s existing value while it also allows us to pursue a higher return business model 
while we did not achieve all of our financial objectives last year  when reflecting on the progress we made toward realizing our goals  we believe fiscal allowed us to build a winning platform for successes yet to come 
we are more optimistic than ever about our future  and we believe fiscal will capitalize on the work we have started  setting new reference points for herman miller and the industry
