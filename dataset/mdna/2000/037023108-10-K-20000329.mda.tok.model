item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company was organized in november to invest in a diversified portfolio of multifamily  commercial and residential mortgage loans  mbs and other real estate related assets in the us and us markets 
in march  the company received million of net proceeds from the initial public offering of  shares and the private placement of  shares of its common stock  which the company used to acquire its initial portfolio of investments 
the company commenced operations on march  the company is a real estate finance company that generates income based on the spread between the interest income on its investments and the interest expense from borrowings used to finance its investments 
because the company has elected to be taxed as a reit its income is largely exempt from corporate taxation and the company is able to generate a higher level of net interest earnings than otherwise obtainable by a taxable corporation making similar investments 
the principal risks that the company faces are i credit risk on the high yield real estate loans and securities it underwrites  ii interest rate risk on the spread between the rates typically one month libor at which the company borrows and the generally longer term rates as represented by the us ten year treasury at which the company lends  and iii funding risk in the amount and cost of debt financing employed by the company over time versus the level of such funding that is sustainable by the financing markets 
these risks are discussed in more detail below  under the heading  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and under capital resources and liquidity 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes 
dollar amounts are expressed in thousands  other than per share amounts

the strength of the economy continues to push rents up to levels well above inflation while demand for space across all property types has been the strongest it has been during the current cycle 
construction activity has remained high but not out of balance 
while many analysts believe this growth will slow down  the market is expected to maintain equilibrium going forward  with selected property types and markets showing slower rent growth 
interest rates the primary shift in the real estate capital markets during was the increase in interest rates 
during the yield on the ten year us treasury note increased by basis points from to 
short term rates followed  as one month libor increased by basis points from to 
the federal reserve s continued concern about inflation has kept upward pressure on short term rates

real estate capital markets during the market for high yield cmbs and commercial loans made a modest recovery from the liquidity crisis of while credit spreads tightened from year end levels  they remain at historically wide levels despite continued strength in the commercial real estate credit markets 
capital flow into the real estate market continues to be weak 
mutual fund flows in the sector produced net outflows of billion in and net outflows of billion in indicating a continuing trend in capital moving out of the sector 
this has led to significant reinvestment opportunities  provided that the real estate and credit markets remain steady 
as an example of the relative opportunity in real estate  evidence shows that investors continue to demand greater compensation for real estate related high yield paper than similarly rated corporate high yield paper in other industries

the unrealized loss on the company s holdings of cmbs increased from  at december  to  at december  this decline in the value of the investment portfolio represents current market valuation changes which the company believes are temporary losses 
the company performs a detailed review of its loss assumptions on a quarterly basis 
as of december  the company concluded that real estate credit fundamentals remain solid  and the company believes there has been no material change in the credit quality of its portfolio 
the company purchased its cmbs portfolio at prices that reflect the assumption that credit losses will occur 
the adjusted purchase price of the company s cmbs portfolio as of december  represents of its par amount 
as the portfolio matures the company expects to recoup its original purchase price  provided that the credit losses experienced are not greater than the credit losses assumed in the purchase analysis 
the adjusted purchase price net of liabilities of the company s entire portfolio including loans  non credit sensitive securities  cash and other assets at december  was  or per share 
the company s earnings depend  in part  on the relationship between long term interest rates and short term interest rates 
a significant part of company s investments bear interest at fixed rates determined by reference to the yields of medium or long term us treasury securities or at adjustable rates determined by reference with a lag to the yields on various short term instruments 
approximately  of the company s assets earn interest at rates that are determined with reference to libor 
all of the company s borrowings bear interest at rates that are determined with reference to libor 
to the extent that interest rates on the company s borrowings increase without an offsetting increase in the interest rates earned on the company s investments  the company s earnings could be negatively affected

the company manages its credit risk through conservative underwriting  diversification  active monitoring of loan performance and exercise of its right to control the workout process as early as possible 
all of these processes are based on the extensive intranet based analytic systems developed by blackrock 
in underwriting loans  the company performs site inspections and or desk top reviews of all loans in the pools 
this process includes detailed analysis of regional economic factors  industry outlooks  project viability and documentation 
unacceptable risks are removed from the pool 
an assumption of expected losses is developed and the securities are priced accordingly 
the company maintains diversification of credit exposures through this underwriting process and can shift its focus in future investments by adjusting the mix of loans in subsequent acquisitions

in general  ffo adjusts net income for non cash charges such as depreciation  certain amortization expenses and gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property 
however  ffo does not represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the results of the company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the definition recommended by the national association of real estate investment trusts 
the company believes that the exclusion from ffo of gains or losses from sales of property was not intended to address gains or losses from sales of securities as it applies to the company 
accordingly  the company includes gains or losses from sales of securities in its calculation of ffo 
the company s ffo for the year ended december  and the period march  through december  were  and  respectively  which were the same as its reported gaap net income loss for the periods 
the company reported cash flows provided by used in operating activities of  and  cash flows used in investing activities  and of  and cash flows used in provided by financing activities of  and  in its statement of cash flows for the year ended december  and the period march  through december   respectively 
results of operations net income for the year ended december  was  or per share diluted 
net loss for the period march  through december  was  or per share basic and diluted 
the increase in income in is primarily due to the fact that the company was in operation for a full year in versus approximately three quarters in  and that the company realized significant losses in from the sale of a substantial portion of its available for sale securities and termination of an interest rate swap agreement 
further details of the changes are set forth below

net interest margin from the portfolio is annualized net interest income from the portfolio divided by the average market value of interest earning assets in the portfolio 
net interest income from the portfolio is total interest income from the portfolio less interest expense relating to collateralized borrowings 
net interest spread from the portfolio equals the yield on average assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period 
the yield on average assets is interest income from the portfolio divided by average amortized cost of interest earning assets in the portfolio 
the average cost of funds is interest expense from the portfolio divided by average outstanding collateralized borrowings 
the following chart describes the interest income  interest expense  net interest margin  and net interest spread for the company s portfolio 
for the period for the year march  ended through december  december  interest income   interest expense   net interest margin net interest spread other expenses expenses other than interest expense consist primarily of management fees and general and administrative expenses 
management fees of  for the year ended december  and  for the period march  through december  were comprised solely of the base management fee paid to the manager for such periods as provided pursuant to the management agreement between the manager and the company  as the manager earned no incentive fee for such periods 
other expenses of  for the year ended december   and for the period march  through december   were comprised of accounting agent fees  custodial agent fees  directors fees  fees for professional services  insurance premiums  broken deal expenses  due diligence costs  and other miscellaneous expenses  which increased in primarily due to the company being in operation for a full year  and its investigations of various strategic acquisitions during that period 
other gains losses during the year ended december  the company sold a portion of its securities available for sale for total proceeds of  resulting in a realized loss of the loss on sale of securities available for sale of  for the period march  to december  consisted of a loss of  on the sale of securities available for sale and  of associated termination costs on an interest rate swap transaction 
the gain on securities held for trading of  for the year ended december  and the loss of for the period march  to december   consisted primarily of realized and unrealized gains and losses on us treasury and agency securities  forward commitments to purchase or sell agency rmbs  and financial futures contracts 
the foreign currency loss of for the year ended december  and the gain of for the period march  to december  relates to the company s net investment in a commercial mortgage loan denominated in pounds sterling and associated hedging

tax basis income was  or per share basic and diluted  for the period march  through december   compared to a net loss as calculated in accordance with gaap of  or per share basic and diluted 
for tax purposes the fourth quarter and dividend of each period is treated as a and distribution  respectively 
thus  for tax purposes the total dividends paid year to date in and were and  respectively 
differences between tax basis net income and gaap net income arise for various reasons 
for example  in computing income from its subordinated cmbs for gaap purposes  the company takes into account estimated credit losses on the underlying loans whereas for tax basis income purposes  only actual credit losses are taken into account 
as there were no actual credit losses incurred in  tax basis income is higher the gaap income 
certain general and administrative expenses may differ due to differing treatment of the deductibility of such expenses for tax basis income 
also  differences could arise in the treatment of premium and discount amortization on the company s securities available for sale 
a reconciliation of gaap net loss to tax basis net income is as follows for the period march  for the year through ended december december  gaap net income loss   net gain loss on securities available for sale   subordinate cmbs income differences   other differences tax basis net income   changes in financial condition securities available for sale at december  and  respectively an aggregate of  and  in unrealized losses on securities available for sale was included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity

the proceeds from these sales were applied primarily to reduce amounts borrowed under the company s reverse repurchase agreements and to increase its cash position 
sales during resulted in total proceeds of  and realized losses of short term borrowings to date  the company s debt has consisted of line of credit borrowings  term loans  reverse repurchase agreements  and preferred stock  which have been collateralized by a pledge of most of the company s securities available for sale  securities held for trading and its commercial mortgage loans 
the company s financial flexibility is affected by its ability to renew or replace on a continuous basis its maturing short term borrowings 
to date  the company has obtained short term financing in amounts and at interest rates consistent with the company s financing objectives 
under the lines of credit  term loans  and the reverse repurchase agreements  the lender retains the right to mark the underlying collateral to market value 
a reduction in the value of its pledged assets will require the company to provide additional collateral or fund margin calls 
from time to time  the company expects that it will be required to provide such additional collateral or fund margin calls 
the following tables set forth information regarding the company s collateralized borrowings 
for the year ended december  december  maximum range of balance balance maturities reverse repurchase agreements   to days line of credit and term loan borrowings   to days for the period march  through december  december  maximum range of balance balance maturities reverse repurchase agreements   to days line of credit and term loan borrowings   to days the company repaid a substantial portion of its borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements during the fourth quarter of hedging instruments the company s hedging policy with regard to its sterling denominated commercial mortgage loan is to minimize its exposure to fluctuations in the sterling exchange rate 
at december   the company s hedging transactions outstanding consisted of forward currency exchange contracts pursuant to which the company agreed to exchange pound  pounds sterling for  us dollars on march  upon the maturity of this contract  the company entered into a similar forward currency exchange contract

the estimated fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts was a liability of and at december   and  respectively  which was recognized as a reduction of net foreign currency gains losses 
from time to time the company may reduce its exposure to market interest rates by entering into various financial instruments that shorten portfolio duration 
these financial instruments are intended to mitigate the effect of interest rates on the value of certain assets in the company s portfolio 
at december   the company had outstanding  a short position of thirty year us treasury bond future contracts and  five year and ten year us treasury note future contracts expiring in march   which represented  and  in face amount of us treasury bond and notes  respectively 
the estimated fair value of these contracts was approximately  at december  capital resources and liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the company s ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund investments  loan acquisition and lending activities and for other general business purposes 
the primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of collateralized borrowings  principal and interest payments on and maturities of securities available for sale  securities held for trading and commercial mortgage loans  and proceeds from sales thereof 
to the extent that the company may become unable to maintain its borrowings at their current level due to changes in the financing markets for the company s assets then the company may be required to sell assets in order to achieve lower borrowings levels 
in this event  the company s level of net earnings would decline 
the company s principal strategies for mitigating this risk are to maintain portfolio leverage at levels it believes are sustainable and to diversify the sources and types of available borrowing and capital 
the company has utilized committed bank facilities  preferred stock  and will consider resecuritization or other achievable term funding of existing assets 
on march   the company filed a  shelf registration statement with the sec 
the shelf registration statement will permit the company to issue a variety of debt and equity securities in the public markets 
there can be no certainty  however  that the company will be able to issue  on terms favorable to the company  or at all  any of the securities so registered 
on december   the company authorized and issued  shares of series a preferred stock for aggregate proceeds of  the series a preferred stock carries a coupon and is convertible into the company s common stock at a price of 
the series a preferred stock has a seven year maturity at which time  at the option of the holders  the shares may be converted into common stock or liquidated for per share 
if converted  the preferred stock would convert into approximately million shares of common stock 
as of december   of the company s  committed credit facility with deutsche bank  ag was available for future borrowings   was available under the company s  credit facility  and  was available under the company s term financing secured by the california loan 
the company s operating activities provided used cash flows of  and  during the year ended december   and the period march  through december   primarily through sales of trading securities in excess of purchases and the purchase of securities held for trading  respectively 
the company s investing activities used cash flows totaling  and  during the year ended december   and the period march  through december   primarily to purchase securities available for sale and to fund a commercial mortgage loans 
the company s financing activities used  during the year ended december   primarily to reduce the level of short term borrowings related to the company s trading portfolio 
the company s financing activities provided  during the period march  through december  and consisted primarily of net short term borrowings and net proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock 
although the company s portfolio of securities available for sale was acquired at a net discount to the face amount of such securities  the company has received to date and expects to continue to have sufficient cash flows from its portfolio to fund distributions to stockholders 
the company is subject to various covenants in its lines of credit  including maintaining a minimum gaap net worth of  a debt to equity ratio not to exceed to  a minimum cash requirement based upon certain debt to equity ratios  a minimum debt service coverage ratio of  and a minimum liquidity reserve of  additionally  the company s gaap net worth cannot decline by more than during the course of any two consecutive fiscal quarters 
as of december  and  the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
the company s ability to execute its business strategy depends to a significant degree on its ability to obtain additional capital 
factors which could affect the company s access to the capital markets  or the costs of such capital  include changes in interest rates  general economic conditions and perception in the capital markets of the company s business  covenants under the company s current and future credit facilities  results of operations  leverage  financial conditions and business prospects 
current conditions in the capital markets for reits such as the company have made permanent financing transactions difficult and more expensive than at the time of the company s initial public offering 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively fund future growth 
except as discussed herein  management is not aware of any other trends  events  commitments or uncertainties that may have a significant effect on liquidity 
reit status the company has elected to be taxed as a reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  with respect thereto 
accordingly  the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent of its distributions to stockholders and as long as certain asset  income and stock ownership tests are met 
the company may  however  be subject to tax at corporate rates or at excise tax rates on net income or capital gains not distributed 
investment company act the company intends to conduct its business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act 
under the investment company act  a non exempt entity that is an investment company is required to register with the securities and exchange commission sec and is subject to extensive  restrictive and potentially adverse regulation relating to  among other things  operating methods  management  capital structure  dividends and transactions with affiliates 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate qualifying interests 
under current interpretation by the staff of the sec  to qualify for this exemption  the company  among other things  must maintain at least of its assets in qualifying interests 
pursuant to such sec staff interpretations  certain of the company s interests in agency pass through and mortgage backed securities and agency insured project loans are qualifying interests 
in general  the company will acquire subordinated interests in commercial mortgage backed securities subordinated cmbs only when such mortgage securities are collateralized by pools of first mortgage loans  when the company can monitor the performance of the underlying mortgage loans through loan management and servicing rights  and when the company has appropriate workout foreclosure rights with respect to the underlying mortgage loans 
when such arrangements exist  the company believes that the related subordinated cmbs constitute qualifying interests for purposes of the investment company act 
therefore  the company believes that it should not be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act as long as it continues to invest primarily in such subordinated cmbs and or in other qualifying interests 
however  if the sec or its staff were to take a different position with respect to whether the company s subordinated cmbs constitute qualifying interests  the company could be required to modify its business plan so that either i it would not be required to register as an investment company or ii it would comply with the investment company act and be able to register as an investment company 
in such event  i modification of the company s business plan so that it would not be required to register as an investment company would likely entail a disposition of a significant portion of the company s subordinated cmbs or the acquisition of significant additional assets  such as agency pass through and mortgage backed securities  which are qualifying interests or ii modification of the company s business plan to register as an investment company would result in significantly increased operating expenses and would likely entail significantly reducing the company s indebtedness including the possible prepayment of the company s short term borrowings  which could also require it to sell a significant portion of its assets 
no assurances can be given that any such dispositions or acquisitions of assets  or deleveraging  could be accomplished on favorable terms 
consequently  any such modification of the company s business plan could have a material adverse effect on the company 
further  if it were established that the company were an unregistered investment company  there would be a risk that the company would be subject to monetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought by the sec  that the company would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties and that third parties could seek to obtain recission of transactions undertaken during the period it was established that the company was an unregistered investment company 
any such results would be likely to have a material adverse effect on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit curve spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk and credit curve risk 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
credit risk is highly sensitive to dynamics of the markets for commercial mortgage securities and other loans and securities held by the company 
excessive supply of these assets combined with reduced demand will cause the market to require a higher yield 
this demand for higher yield will cause the market to use a higher spread over the us treasury securities yield curve  or other benchmark interest rates  to value these assets 
changes in the general level of the us treasury yield curve can have significant effects on the market value of the company s portfolio 
the majority of the company s assets are fixed rate securities valued based on a market credit spread to us treasuries 
as us treasury securities are priced to a higher yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is increased  the market value of the company s portfolio may decline 
conversely  as us treasury securities are priced to a lower yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is decreased  the market value of the company s portfolio may increase 
changes in the market value of the company s portfolio may affect the company s net income or cash flow directly through their impact on unrealized gains or losses on securities held for trading or indirectly through their impact on the company s ability to borrow 
changes in the level of the us treasury yield curve can also affect  among other things  the prepayment assumptions used to value certain of the company s securities and the company s ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
in addition  changes in the general level of the libor money market rates can affect the company s net interest income 
the majority of the company s liabilities are floating rate based on a market spread to us libor 
as the level of libor increases or decreases  the company s interest expense will move in the same direction 
the company may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on its operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and  indeed  that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
a hedge may not perform its intended purpose of offsetting losses or increased costs 
moreover  with respect to certain of the instruments used as hedges  the company is exposed to the risk that the counterparties with which the company trades may cease making markets and quoting prices in such instruments  which may render the company unable to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to an open position 
if the company anticipates that the income from any such hedging transaction will not be qualifying income for reit income test purposes  the company may conduct part or all of its hedging activities through a to be formed corporate subsidiary that is fully subject to federal corporate income taxation 
the profitability of the company may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following tables quantify the potential changes in the company s net portfolio value and net interest income under various interest rate and credit spread scenarios 
net portfolio value is defined as the value of interest earning assets net of the value of interest bearing liabilities 
it is evaluated using an assumption that interest rates  as defined by the us treasury yield curve  increase or decrease up to basis points and the assumption that the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
net interest income is defined as interest income earned from interest earning assets net of the interest expense incurred by the interest bearing liabilities 
it is evaluated using the assumptions that interest rates  as defined by the us libor curve  increase or decrease by basis points and the assumption that the yield curve of the libor rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
market value in this scenario is calculated using the assumption that the us treasury yield curve remains constant 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the respective values calculated in the scenario labeled as base case 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates as of december  and actual results could differ significantly from these estimates

default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  property performance  property management  supply demand factors  construction trends  consumer behavior  regional economics  interest rates  the strength of the american economy  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
all loans are subject to a certain probability of default 
the nature of the cmbs assets owned are such that all losses experienced by a pool of mortgages will be borne by the company 
changes in the expected default rates of the underlying mortgages will significantly affect the value of the company  the income it accrues and the cash flow it receives 
an increase in default rates will reduce the book value of the company s assets and the company earnings and cash flow available to fund operations and pay dividends 
the company manages credit risk through the underwriting process  establishing loss assumptions  and careful monitoring of loan performance 
before acquiring a security that represents a pool of loans  the company will perform a rigorous analysis of the quality of substantially all of the loans proposed for that security 
as a result of this analysis  loans with unacceptable risk profiles will be removed from the proposed security 
information from this review is then used to establish loss assumptions 
the company will assume that a certain portion of the loans will default and calculate an expected  or loss adjusted yield based on that assumption 
after the securities have been acquired the company monitors the performance of the loans  as well as external factors that may affect their value 
factors that indicate a higher loss severity or timing experience is likely to cause a reduction in the expected yield  and therefore reduce the earnings of the company and may require a significant write down of assets 
for purposes of illustration  a doubling of the losses in the company s credit sensitive portfolio  without a significant acceleration of those losses would reduce the expected yield from to 
this would reduce gaap income going forward and cause a significant write down in assets at the time the loss assumption is changed 
asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing and or maturing of assets and liabilities 
it is the objective of the company to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to match the term of the company s liabilities as closely as possible with the expected holding period of the company s assets 
this is less important for those assets in the company s portfolio considered liquid as there is a very stable market for the financing of these securities 
the company uses interest rate duration as its primary measure of interest rate risk 
this metric  expressed when considering any existing leverage  allows the company s management to approximate changes in the net market value of the company s portfolio given potential changes in the us treasury yield curve 
interest rate duration considers both assets and liabilities 
as of december   and the company s duration on equity was approximately and years  respectively 
this implies that a parallel shift of the us treasury yield curve of basis points would cause the company s net asset value to increase or decrease by approximately and  respectively 
because the company s assets  and their markets  have other  more complex sensitivities to interest rates  the company s management believes that this metric represents a good approximation of the change in portfolio net market value in response to changes in interest rates  though actual performance may vary due to changes in prepayments  credit spreads and the cost of increased market volatility 
other methods for evaluating interest rate risk  such as interest rate sensitivity gap defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period  are used but are considered of lesser significance in the daily management of the company s portfolio 
the majority of the company s assets pay a fixed coupon and the income from such assets are relatively unaffected by interest rate changes 
the majority of the company s liabilities are borrowings under its line of credit or reverse repurchase agreements that bear interest at variable rates that reset monthly 
given this relationship between assets and liabilities  the company s interest rate sensitivity gap is highly negative 
this implies that a period of falling short term interest rates will tend to increase the company s net interest income while a period of rising short term interest rates will tend to reduce the company s net interest income 
management considers this relationship when reviewing the company s hedging strategies 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect the company s net interest income positively or negatively even if the company were to be perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the company currently has positions in forward currency exchange contracts to hedge currency exposure in connection with its commercial mortgage loan denominated in pounds sterling 
the purpose of the company s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the company from the risk that the eventual us dollar net cash inflows from the commercial mortgage loan will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company s current strategy is to roll these contracts from time to time to hedge the expected cash flows from the loan 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates are not expected to have a material impact on the company s net portfolio value or net interest income
