item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction on october   bowmar instrument corporation bowmar merged with electronic designs  inc edi 
in connection with the merger  bowmar changed its name to white electronic designs corporation the company 
while bowmar was the legal acquirer  the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition purchase whereby edi was deemed to have acquired bowmar for financial reporting purposes 
consistent with the reverse acquisition purchase accounting treatment  the historical financial statements presented for periods prior to the merger date are the financial statements of edi  not the previously reported consolidated financial statements of bowmar 
the operations of both companies combined as white electronic designs have been included in the financial statements from the date of the merger 
results of operations fiscal vs fiscal revenues net sales increased to million for the year ended september  from million in the same period of this increase was primarily due to a increase in sales of microelectronic components to million from million 
sales of commercial memory products increased from the previous year because of substantially higher shipment volume combined with increased average selling prices based on new product sales 
sales of high reliability products increased from the previous year based on higher shipment volumes of monolithic products and level average selling prices when compared to the previous year 
display sales increased  or  from the previous year on slightly higher shipment volumes 
sales of semiconductor products  such as the components used to make our memory products  have historically been cyclical  and subject to wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
currently  the industry is experiencing high demand for certain memory components 
while this demand has strengthened average selling prices  it has also caused a shortage of certain components 
we have already seen lead times for components  such as flash and sram products  increase substantially 
we are currently working to assure a steady flow of supplies from our vendors 
the ability to increase our sales in the future will be dependent on our ability to obtain adequate supplies of semiconductor products from the manufacturers 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to increase our allocations from the semiconductor vendors 
any increase in revenues and profits will also depend on the continued growth of various electronics industries that use our products such as manufacturers of telecommunications equipment  networking equipment  and military equipment 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales improved to for the period ended september   from in the previous year 
the microelectronic segment saw margins improve to from 
the improvement was primarily because of higher shipment volumes in both the commercial and high reliability memory products  which spread fixed manufacturing costs over more units  and a favorable product mix which included new commercial products and memory modules which have a higher average selling price 
gross margin for the display segment improved to from in the previous year because of a higher ratio of liquid crystal display sales and higher shipments of ruggedized liquid crystal displays which had higher selling prices than the product mix last year 
while gross margins have improved substantially since last year  we could experience competitive pressures in our markets from existing companies which could limit our ability to hold current average selling prices  restrict our access to electronic and display components  or make it harder for us to hire and retain key people in the manufacturing  technical  and engineering areas 
unfavorable events in any of these areas could impact our ability to manufacture product and maintain current sales or gross margins levels 
accordingly  there can be no assurance we will be able to sustain our recent gross margins 
we have taken various actions to maintain our gross margins  including purchasing new capital equipment to improve our efficiencies in the manufacturing areas to increase our throughput 
we continue to work with semiconductor and display glass manufacturers to improve the availability of raw materials 
we have also implemented programs to hire new employees and train  and retain our current employees to meet our production requirements 
however  we currently have open requirements for engineering  marketing  and manufacturing personnel who are needed to pursue growth opportunities in both our business segments 
we have been unable to fill these positions for several months 
this personnel shortage could limit our ability to expand both of our business segments 
given the current demands of the labor market  there can be no assurance that we will meet all of our personnel requirements for either of our business segments 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling expenses for the year ended september   increased million from the same period of the previous year 
increases in spending for microelectronic sales represented million of this increase 
the largest component of the increase in microelectronic expenses was a million increase in sales commission expenses based upon a sales increase for the segment from the previous year 
the remaining increase was mainly due to expenses for new sales personnel  advertising and marketing to support sales into the telecommunications markets 
selling expenses for the display segment were  higher than last year and were mainly used to target the aviation markets 
general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended september   when compared to the same period in the previous year 
this increase is mainly due to higher salary and benefit expenses relating to employee incentive pay  legal expenses  costs associated with shareholder services and the change in listing of our common stock from the american stock exchange to the nasdaq national market 
for the year ended september   selling  general and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of sales to from in the prior year 
research and product development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended september  increased million from the previous year and totaled of net sales 
the main source of the increase came from the microelectronic segment  which increased spending million from the previous year 
major ongoing product development efforts include sdram  microprocessor modules  ball grid array products  development of new packaging designs for memory products  and qualification of new semiconductor products 
the display segment expenses were  lower than last year mainly because of reductions in spending for interface and mechanical products 
spending on liquid crystal display development was approximately of net sales in we believe that continued strategic investment in process technology and product development is essential for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve 
we are committed to the appropriate levels of expenditures for research and development 
merger expense the merger expense of  incurred during fiscal  related to the merger of bowmar instrument corporation and electronic designs  inc  which occurred on october  and formed white electronic designs corporation 
these expenses consisted mainly of severance costs and charges for professional services to complete the merger 
no additional merger related costs were incurred during fiscal year discontinued operations in connection with the october sale by edi of its crystallume diamond products division  the company had recorded a receivable in the amount of  as previously disclosed  the buyer asserted an indemnity claim against the company and refused to pay the  balance due  including the initial installment of  which was due on october  the company and the buyer have resolved this matter 
in exchange for executing mutual releases the company has reduced the receivable to  the results of this settlement are reflected in the fiscal statement of income under results from discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash on hand as of september  totaled  during fiscal year  cash provided by operations was approximately  the sum of net income  depreciation  and amortization totaled approximately million for the period 
however  increases in accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and other assets  based on higher levels of sales activity  used approximately million for working capital requirements 
cash balances increased approximately million during the period 
this increase was funded by borrowings under our line of credit  which increased million from year end 
during fiscal  we recorded an increase in prepaid taxes because of an expected million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options during the fiscal year 
without this entry  cash used by operations totaled  other uses of cash during fiscal included capital expenditures of million  reduction of long term debt of  first quarter convertible preferred stock dividend payment of  and redemption of convertible preferred stock of  during the second quarter  we completed the redemption of our convertible preferred stock 
over of the shareholders elected to convert their convertible preferred shares into shares of common stock 
the remaining shareholders were paid a total of  based on redemption price of per share 
the redemption ended our requirement to pay quarterly dividends on the preferred shares of  and no dividends were paid after the first quarter 
accounts receivable have increased million from the year ended october  this increase is consistent with our higher quarterly sales when compared to the fourth quarter of last year million versus million in the fourth quarter of 
the current accounts receivable balance of million represents of the current quarterly sales rate and is consistent with the ratio at october  inventory levels have increased million from the year ended october  this increase is consistent with our higher quarterly sales when compared to the fourth quarter of last year million versus million in the fourth quarter of 
the current inventory balances also take into account projected production requirements 
also  because of potential semiconductor component shortages in the future  we are sometimes required to purchase inventory in advance of our needs to ensure a steady flow of material through the factory 
inventory amounts  when compared to the current quarterly sales rate  increased to of quarterly sales at year end compared to of quarterly sales at year end we believe we are holding appropriate inventory levels  based upon lead times for our raw materials and projected production requirements 
accounts payable were million higher at the end of fiscal year than at the end of fiscal this is consistent with increased levels of production and requirements for raw materials as stated above 
capital expenditures for the year ended september  totaled approximately million 
approximately  has been spent to increase production capacity for our commercial memory products and over  has been spent to upgrade our hi rel manufacturing equipment 
approximately  was spent to upgrade equipment in our display division 
we expect capital expenditures for fiscal to be at approximately the same level as fiscal future capital expenditures will be funded by cash from operations  line of credit borrowings  or operating lease financing 
during the month of january  we completed a new revolving credit agreement with bank one 
this agreement increased our maximum borrowing limit to million from the previous limit of million 
the actual borrowing limit at any time is subject to available accounts receivable and inventory balances 
as of the end of the fiscal year  we were in compliance with all debt covenant requirements in the loan agreement 
we believe that cash generated by operations  in addition to our borrowing capability  should be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months 
to improve our borrowing costs  during the month of june  we negotiated a change to our revolving credit agreement with bank one 
the change allows us to borrow from our available line of credit at a rate of libor london interbank offering rate instead of the current prime rate 
there were no other changes to the agreement 
interest expense interest expense increased  for the year ended september   when compared to the same period in the previous year 
the increase was caused by additional borrowings against our line of credit to support higher inventory levels necessary to meet sales requirements 
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense increased  for the year ended september  twelve months of amortization has been taken in fiscal  while only eleven months of amortization were included in the same period of fiscal because of the timing of the merger

results of operations fiscal vs revenues fiscal and revenues were  and  the increase in net sales between fiscal and is due to the inclusion in the financial presentation for fiscal of the combined results of the former bowmar and edi 
if the net sales of bowmar had been included in the fiscal  combined sales would have been  the primary reasons for the decrease in combined sales include reductions in spending from year to year in the defense industry  the lower average sales prices and the lower demand in the military memory market brought on by the conversion to commercial off the shelf cots parts 
gross margins as a percentage of sales  gross margin increased during fiscal to from in fiscal if bowmar s fiscal sales and cost of goods sold were included  gross margin as a percentage of sales would have increased in fiscal by from fiscal this is mainly due to lower cost of sales and improved production efficiencies which were primarily due to lower material costs and headcount decreases 
cost of goods sold was negatively impacted by merger expenses resulting from the write up of inventories because of the allocation of the acquisition costs and severance payments to former employees 
selling  general and administrative expenses the inclusion of bowmar s selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal would have resulted in a decrease of  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease results from lower sales cost and commissions due to reorganization in the sales departments 
in addition  the company realized savings in selling  general and administrative expenses due to merger related efficiencies 
research and product development expenses product development expenses for fiscal increased by  from fiscal the inclusion of bowmar s product development expenses in fiscal would have resulted in an increase of  in fiscal versus fiscal product development expenses for fiscal increased  from fiscal the yearly increases are due primarily to increases in salaries and project costs associated with new product development 
liquidity and capital resources at october   working capital increased to  from  at september   principally as a result of the increase in current assets due to the merger 
the company s current ratio at fiscal year end improved to approximately to the company s total debt to equity ratio remained at approximately to in fiscal and  the company used  and generated  respectively of cash from operating activities 
the major uses of cash in fiscal were  for the retirement of long term debt and  in payments for capital expenditures 
depreciation and amortization expense was  during fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal primarily consisted of  for upgrading to a new computer system and related costs   for test equipment and  for facility upgrades 
the remaining  in expenditures was for manufacturing and general office equipment 
the company s capital expenditure plans are principally to expand manufacturing capacity and are expected to be financed largely through existing credit lines  and to a lesser extent  through funds provided from operating leases 
with the inclusion of bowmar s balance sheet account balances as of the date of the merger  other major changes in balance sheet accounts during fiscal include an increase in accounts receivable of  mainly due to shipment timing differences from previous years  an increase in inventories of  in connection with the higher year end backlog  accounts payables and accrued expenses that partially offset the above working capital changes by increasing  from fiscal the current portion of long term debt increased  relating to the company s line of credit  which increased to  from  at the end fiscal this increase was partially offset by retirement of the current portion of long term debt of  during fiscal interest expense interest expense increased  from fiscal mainly because of increased borrowings under the line of credit 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of the fiscal year ended september  we had an outstanding balance of million borrowed against our revolving line of credit with bank one 
during the fiscal year  the average outstanding balance on a daily basis was approximately million 
the interest charged against these borrowings is a combination of the bank one prime rate  which is similar to the prime rate charged by major banking institutions in the united states  and the london interbank offering rate libor plus 
during fiscal the prime rate averaged  and was at as of september  currently  libor plus is approximately 
based on average borrowings of million per year  a hypothetical rate change of would increase our interest expense approximately  per year from current expense levels 
using an average outstanding balance of million  a rate increase would increase our interest expense approximately  per year from current expense levels 
we believe that moderate interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  or financial position  in the foreseeable future
