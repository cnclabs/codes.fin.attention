see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company has traditionally reported lower profit margins in the first two quarters of each fiscal year than those experienced in the third and fourth quarters 
as part of the annual budget process  management establishes higher discretionary expense levels in relation to projected revenue for the first half of the year 
historically  the company s combined third and fourth quarter revenue has been greater than that of the first half of the year  as these two quarters coincide with clients calendar year budget periods and the culmination of the company s annual sales plan 
this historically higher second half revenue has resulted in significantly higher profit margins since total expenses have not increased in proportion to revenue 
however  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance 
the company s products are designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of its clients information processing resources 
accordingly  in a recessionary environment  the company s products are often a reasonable economic alternative to customers faced with the prospect of incurring expenditures to increase their existing information processing resources 
however  a general or regional slowdown in the world economy could adversely affect the company s operations 
additionally  further deterioration of the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the us dollar may continue to affect the company s ability to increase its revenue within those markets 
as the company grows  it is increasingly dependent upon large dollar enterprise transactions with individual clients 
the size and magnitude of such transactions have increased over time 
there are no assurances that comparable transactions will occur in subsequent periods 
the company s future operating results may also be affected by a number of other factors  including but not limited to a significant percentage of the company s quarterly sales being finalized in the last few days of the period making financial forecasts especially difficult  which could create a substantial risk of variances with the actual results  the continued risks of potential litigation arising from the year date change for computer programs  the emergence of new competitive initiatives resulting from rapid technological advances  changes in pricing in the market  the risks associated with new product introductions as well as the uncertainty of marketplace acceptance of these new or enhanced products from either the company or its competitors  risks associated with the entry into new markets at lower profit margins  such as professional services  the risks associated with integrating newly acquired businesses and technologies  delays in product delivery  reliance on mainframe capacity growth  the ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel  business conditions in the distributed and mainframe software and hardware markets  the strength of the company s distribution channels  uncertainty and volatility associated with internet and ebusiness related activities  the ability to update the company s product offerings to conform with new governmental rules  use of software patent rights to attempt to limit competition  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  the volatility of the international marketplace  uncertainties relative to global economic conditions  the company s reliance on a single family of products for a material portion of its sales  the effect of new accounting pronouncements and interpretations on the company s revenue recognition practices  the company s ability to manage fixed and variable expense growth relative to revenue growth  and other risks described in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
with the acquisition of sterling on march   and a subsequent worldwide sales reorganization in april  there can be no assurances that the distractions and uncertainties caused by these events will not have a negative effect on the company s revenue and net income during fiscal year in process research and development in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired sterling in a stock for stock exchange valued at approximately billion 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired platinum for approximately billion in cash and assumed liabilities 
there were no acquisitions involving acquired in process research and development ipr d charges in fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning acquisitions 
acquired ipr d charges relate to acquisitions of software companies accounted for under the purchase method  in which a portion of the purchase price is allocated to acquired in process technology and is expensed immediately  since the technological feasibility of the research and development projects have not yet been achieved and are believed to have no alternative future use 
independent valuations of sterling and platinum were performed and used as an aid in determining the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets and in allocating the purchase price among the acquired assets  including the portion of the purchase price attributed to ipr d which was million and million for sterling and platinum  respectively 
assets were identified through on site interviews with management and a review of data provided by the company and discussions with the acquired companies management concerning the acquired assets  technologies in development  costs necessary to complete the ipr d  historical financial performance  estimates of future performance  market potential  and the assumptions underlying these estimates 
the income approach was utilized for the valuation analysis of ipr d for both sterling and platinum 
this approach focuses on the income producing capability of the asset and was obtained through review of data provided by the company and the acquired companies and analysis of relevant market sizes  growth factors  and expected trends in technology 
the steps followed in applying this approach included estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values using a rate of return consistent with the relative risk levels 
the ongoing development projects at sterling at the time of the purchase were comprised primarily of application development and information management  business intelligence  network management  and storage management tools and solutions 
the acquired projects included add on features  tools and next generation versions of cool  vision  eureka  sams  tm and solve r product families 
at the time of acquisition  it was estimated that  on average  of the development effort had been completed and the remaining development effort would take approximately months to complete  with a cost of approximately million 
the ongoing development projects at platinum at the time of the purchase were comprised primarily of application development  database  and enterprise management tools  and data warehousing solutions 
the acquired projects included add on features  tools and next generation versions of db solutions  tm provisiontm security  advantagetm application development  end to end data warehousing  and internet infrastructure product families 
at the time of acquisition  it was estimated that  on average  of the development effort had been completed and the remaining development effort would take approximately months to complete  with a cost of approximately million 
the resulting net cash flows from the sterling and platinum projects were based on management s estimates of product revenues  cost of goods sold  operating expenses  r d costs  and income taxes from such projects 
the revenue projections used to value the ipr d were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
the rate used in discounting the net cash flows from the ipr d approximated for both sterling and platinum 
these discount rates  higher than that of the company s cost of capital  are due to the uncertainties surrounding the successful development of ipr d 
the efforts required to develop the in process technology of the acquired companies into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of planning  designing  prototyping  and testing functions that are necessary to establish that the software produced will meet its design specifications  including technical performance  features  and function requirements 
the company has reviewed its projections of revenue and estimated costs of completion and has compared these projections with results through march  to date  in the aggregate  the projections have not varied materially from original projections 
if these projects do not continue to be successfully developed  the revenue and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
results will also be subject to uncertain market events and risks that are beyond the company s control  such as trends in technology  government regulations  market size and growth  and product introduction by competitors 
management believes that the assumptions used in the purchased ipr d valuation reasonably estimate the future benefits 
there can be no assurance that in future periods actual results will not deviate from current estimates 
year issue as of the date of this filing  the company has not incurred any significant business disruptions nor product interruptions as a result of the year date change 
while no such occurrences have developed  year issues may not become apparent as of this date  and therefore there is no assurance that the company will not experience future disruptions 
the company has designed and tested substantially all of its recent product offerings to be year compliant 
these products have met rigorous compliance criteria and have undergone extensive review to detect any year failures 
the company has publicly identified products that have not been and will not be updated to be year compliant and has encouraged clients using these products to migrate to compliant versions products 
in general  these year compliance efforts have been part of the company s ongoing software development process 
as such  incremental costs are not deemed material and have been included in product development and enhancement expenses 
there can be no assurances that the company s compliant products do not contain undetected problems associated with year compliance 
although the company believes that its license agreements provide it with protection against liability  the company cannot predict whether  or to what extent  any legal claims will be brought  or whether the company will suffer any liability as a result of adverse consequences to its customers 
additionally  the company adopted a millennium watchsm plan whereby clients around the world were provided with hour on site and in house technical support from december  through january  the company extended the schedules of the internal administrative and facility related staff to support the infrastructure during the millennium watch 
the plan resulted in approximately million of additional expenditures over the period 
the company has recognized the significance of the year issue as it relates to its internal systems including it and non it systems  and understands that the impact extends beyond traditional hardware and software to automated facility systems and third party suppliers 
the total cost of preparing internal systems to be year compliant has not been and is not expected to be material to the company s operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
total known expenditures  excluding personnel costs of existing staff  related to internal systems year readiness were approximately million 
such expenditures commenced in demand for certain of the company s products was generated by customers who were replacing or upgrading computer systems to accommodate the year date change 
following the date change  demand for some of the company s products diminished 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities increased million from the march  balance of million to  million at march  cash and investments associated with sterling represented approximately million of the year end balance 
year to date cash generated from operations was  million  an increase of from the prior year 
the company used its cash from operations primarily to fund acquisition costs and for debt reduction 
the primary source of cash for the year was higher net income adjusted for non cash charges 
other sources of cash included strong collections of outstanding accounts receivable and the company s decision  in the fourth quarter  to assign selected existing installment accounts receivable to a third party 
the company may continue to explore the use of financing companies as a means of expediting debt reduction  mitigating interest rate risk  and reducing installment accounts receivable balances 
as part of its acquisition of platinum in may  the company terminated its revolving credit lines and replaced them with billion of committed bank financing 
this financing consisted of a billion day revolving credit facility  a billion four year revolving credit facility and a billion four year term loan 
borrowings on these facilities for fiscal year totaled billion and were used to purchase the outstanding shares of platinum and fund related shut down costs

approximately us million was outstanding under this facility at march  upon maturity in june  the company anticipates the facility will be converted into a long term mortgage for the property 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company also expects to implement a commercial paper program as a means of reducing its borrowing costs and establishing a presence in a new liquidity market

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio  debt  and installment accounts receivable 
the company has a prescribed methodology whereby it invests its excess cash in debt instruments of government agencies and high quality corporate issuers generally standard poor s single a rating and higher 
to mitigate risk  many of the securities have a maturity date within one year  and holdings of any one issuer excluding the us government do not exceed 
periodically  the portfolio is reviewed and adjusted if the credit rating of a security held has deteriorated 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments 
the company maintains a blend of both fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
at march   the company s total outstanding debt approximated billion 
of this amount  approximately billion was comprised of fixed rate obligations  the remaining billion was floating rate debt 
if market rates decline  the company could be required to make payments on the fixed rate debt that would exceed those based on current market rates 
each basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million 
each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an approximately million annual effect on variable rate debt interest based upon the balances of such debt at march  the company offers financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with its software solution sales 
the aggregate contract value includes an imputed interest element  which can vary with the interest rate environment 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk the company conducts business on a worldwide basis through subsidiaries in countries 
the company is therefore exposed to movement in currency exchange rates 
as part of its risk management strategy and consistent with prior years  the company did not enter into any foreign exchange derivative transactions 
in addition  the company manages its level of exposure by denominating international sales and payment of related expenses in the local currency of its subsidiaries 
a decline in all foreign currencies against the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on the company s net income 
equity price risk the company has a minimal investment in marketable equity securities of publicly traded companies 
at march   these investments were considered available for sale with any unrealized gains or losses deferred as a component of stockholders equity 
it is not customary for the company to make investments in equity securities as part of its investment strategy
