we derived no net revenues from continuing operations for any period prior to november as we did not operate any web sites during those periods 
cost of revenues 
we incurred cost of revenues from continuing operations of million for fiscal and no cost of revenues from continuing operations for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  cost of revenues was for fiscal gross profit 
we had gross profit from continuing operations of million for fiscal and no gross profit from continuing operations for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit from continuing operations was for fiscal sales and marketing expenses 
we incurred sales and marketing expenses from continuing operations of million for fiscal and no sales and marketing expenses from continuing operations for fiscal product development expenses 
we incurred product development expenses from continuing operations of million for fiscal and no product development expenses from continuing operations for fiscal a meaningful portion of our product development expenses in fiscal was paid to a third party web site development company 
because we are currently handling more development internally  we do not anticipate that a significant portion of our product development expenses in fiscal will be for third party web site development services 
general and administrative expenses 
we incurred general and administrative expenses from continuing operations of million for fiscal and million for fiscal while our continuing operations were not in existence in fiscal  the recorded expenses reflect costs for personnel  facilities and professional fees that are currently associated with our continuing operations 
stock based compensation  primarily related to sales and marketing  expense

of the million of stock based compensation expense  million related to warrants granted to our partners   related to options or warrants granted to non employees and  related to options granted to employees 
as of january   we had an aggregate of million of deferred compensation remaining to be amortized 
interest 
interest income consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense relates primarily to bank borrowings 
in fiscal  we had interest income of  net of interest expense 
in fiscal  we had million of interest expense  net of interest income 
fiscal and fiscal because our continuing operations were not in existence in fiscal or fiscal  we had no net revenues  cost of sales or operating expenses related to our continuing operations  other than general and administrative expenses of million in fiscal and million in fiscal these general and administrative expenses reflect the costs of personnel  facilities and professional fees that are currently associated with our continuing operations 
accordingly  comparisons of results from continuing operations for fiscal and fiscal are not meaningful 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we financed our operations through a combination of internally generated funds  equity financings  subordinated borrowings and bank credit facilities 
we used our bank credit facilities to fund our investment in accounts receivable and inventory necessary to support our historical businesses 
in connection with our decision to focus exclusively on our e commerce business  we raised approximately million in gross proceeds through our equity financing with softbank in july we used part of the proceeds from this financing to repay the balance on our then outstanding lines of credit  reduce trade payables and provide operating capital related to our historical businesses 
we also used part of the proceeds to acquire property and equipment and fund working capital for our e commerce business 
as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  and working capital of approximately million  which included approximately million of net assets of discontinued operations 
we have incurred substantial costs to develop our e commerce business and to recruit  train and compensate personnel for our creative  engineering  marketing  advertising  merchandising  customer service and administration departments 
as a result  we have incurred substantial losses for fiscal and  as of january   had an accumulated deficit of million 
in order to expand our e commerce business  we intend to invest heavily in operations  web site development  marketing  merchandising and additional personnel 
we therefore expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we used approximately million in net cash for operating activities of continuing operations in fiscal  while we generated approximately million in net cash from operating activities of continuing operations in fiscal net cash used in operating activities of continuing operations in fiscal was primarily the result of net losses from continuing operations and changes in inventory and accounts receivable  partially offset by changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses and stock based compensation expense 
net cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations in fiscal was primarily the result of net losses from continuing operations and changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our investing activities in fiscal consisted of purchases of property and equipment 
we made capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  which were partially offset by million in proceeds of the sale of our branded division 
as of january   we had commitments of million relating to the implementation of advertising and promotion programs 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we expect to receive a cash payment of million relating to the sale of our off price and action sports division 
management expects that our current cash position combined with the proceeds from the sale of our off price and action sports division  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private financings or other arrangements to fund our operations until we achieve profitability 
failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and operating results 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
seasonality we expect to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues 
these seasonal patterns will cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results 
in particular  we expect that the fourth fiscal quarter will account for a large percentage of our total annual sales 
we believe that results of operations for a quarterly period may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the full year 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
year many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept or recognize only two digit entries in the date code field 
these systems and software products need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruption of operations for any company using computer programs or hardware 
with respect to our branded division and its off price and action sports division  we maintained a management information system that provided  among other things  comprehensive customer order processing  inventory  production  accounting and management information for the marketing  selling  manufacturing and distribution functions of our business 
subsequent to the sale of the branded division on december   we use these systems only for the off price and action sports division and in connection with the collection of the accounts receivable of the branded division which it retained 
we completed  as of april   a year project which evaluated  identified  corrected  reprogrammed  and tested our existing systems for year compliance 
we enhanced our key information systems to improve our functionality and increase performance during the first quarter of  making these applications year compliant 
the costs of these upgrades of approximately  were charged to operations as incurred 
upon consummation of the sale of the off price and action sports division and collection of the accounts receivable of the branded division  we will not have any need for these systems 
our e commerce business is a new enterprise and accordingly  we have purchased or developed most of the software and hardware we use in our e commerce business during fiscal while this does not uniformly protect us against year exposure  we believe our exposure is limited because the systems we use are not based upon legacy hardware or software systems 
we updated our office networking system software to be year compliant during the third quarter of fiscal the costs of the process did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  liquidity or capital resources 
in addition to making our own systems year compliant  we contacted the customers and key suppliers of our branded division and off price and action sports division to determine the extent to which the systems of these customers and suppliers are year compliant and the extent to which we could be affected by the failure of these third parties to become year compliant 
we cannot presently estimate the impact of the failure of these third parties to become year compliant  however  subsequent to january   we have not encountered any problems related to year issues 
there can be no assurance  however  that future year issues  if any  will not arise 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies and in high quality corporate issuers 
we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates
