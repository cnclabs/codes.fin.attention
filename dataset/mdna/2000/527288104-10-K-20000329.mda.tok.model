results of operations property and casualty insurance the company s most significant operation is its insurance business  where it is a provider of property and casualty insurance primarily in the new york metropolitan area

net earned premium revenues of the empire group were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
while earned premiums declined in all lines of business  the most significant reductions during were in assigned risk automobile  voluntary private passenger automobile  and commercial package policies 
as a result of poor operating results  the empire group is no longer entering into new assigned risk contracts 
effective january   all policy renewal obligations have been assigned to another insurance company 
however  the empire group remains liable for the claim settlement costs for assigned risk claims that occurred during the policy term 
the empire group believes it has provided adequate reserves for such liabilities  including loss adjustment expenses 
the decline in voluntary private passenger automobile resulted from tighter underwriting standards  increased competition and the empire group s decision to no longer accept new policies from those agents who historically have had poor underwriting results 
the empire group s termination of certain unprofitable agents has also adversely affected premium volume in other lines of business 
in  the decrease in earned premium revenues was primarily due to a decline in the number of assigned risk automobile pool contracts acquired due to competition and the depopulation of the assigned risk automobile pools  and a reduction in certain lines  principally voluntary commercial automobile  private passenger automobile  commercial package policies  and workers compensation  due to tighter underwriting standards  reunderwriting and increased competition 
the empire group s combined ratios as determined under gaap and sap were as follows year ended december  gaap sap the empire group s combined ratios increased in and primarily due to the reduction in premium volume at a rate greater than the reduction in net underwriting and other costs 
in addition  the reduction in servicing fees negatively affected the expense ratios 
expense ratios were also adversely affected by increased expenditures related to the installation of new information systems  providing internet access to agents and severance costs 
included in the empire group s results for  and were   and  respectively  for reserve strengthening related to losses from prior accident years 
during  the empire group experienced unfavorable development due to an increase in severity of accident year losses in the assigned risk automobile and voluntary private passenger automobile lines  and accident year losses in certain classes of the commercial automobile line 
as a result  the empire group increased its reserves by  for assigned risk automobile   for voluntary private passenger automobile and  for commercial automobile lines 
as previously discussed  the empire group no longer accepts new policies from certain agents identified as having had poor underwriting results in the voluntary private passenger automobile line of business and  effective january   the empire group no longer participates in the assigned risk business 
additionally  the empire group no longer offers insurance in those classes of the commercial automobile line that contributed to the unfavorable development 
during  the empire group reviewed the adequacy of the reserves carried for its open claims files  focusing on workers compensation  commercial auto and other commercial liability lines of business 
as part of the review  substantially all open workers compensation claim files were reviewed for every accident year up to and including additionally  during  the empire group reorganized the commercial auto claims department 
as part of this realignment  more complex claims files were reviewed by the most experienced claims examiners and assumptions regarding average claims severity and probable ultimate losses were revised 
accordingly  reserves were strengthened by  for workers compensation   for commercial automobile and  for other commercial liability lines of business 
the reserve strengthening included  for commercial package lines of business and  for voluntary commercial automobile lines of business 
these increases resulted from a review of open claim files and the continued unfavorable development of prior accident years losses  particularly the through accident years 
as a consequence of its reserve increases  the empire group has reduced premiums and pre tax profits to recognize reinsurance premiums due for and prior years under retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements 
such amounts totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the empire group has not entered into retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements after for the lines of business discussed above  as well as all other property and casualty lines of business  the company employs a variety of standard actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques  statistical analyses and case basis evaluations to estimate its liability for unpaid losses 
the actuarial projections include an extrapolation of both losses paid and incurred by business line and accident year and implicitly consider the impact of inflation and claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon historical patterns 
these estimates are performed quarterly and consider any changes in trends and actual loss experience 
any resulting change in the estimate of the liability for unpaid losses  including those discussed above  is reflected in current year earnings during the quarter the change in estimate is identified 
the reserving process relies on the basic assumption that past experience is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
the probable effects of current developments  trends and other relevant matters are also considered 
since the establishment of loss reserves is affected by many factors  some of which are outside the company s control or are affected by future conditions  reserving for property and casualty claims is a complex and uncertain process requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  the company s estimates and judgments may be revised 
while the effect of any such changes in estimates could be material to future results of operations  the company does not expect such changes to have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition 
in management s judgment  information currently available has been appropriately considered in estimating the company s loss reserves 
the company will continue to evaluate the adequacy of its loss reserves on a quarterly basis  incorporating any future changes in trends and actual loss experience  and record adjustments to its loss reserves as appropriate 
banking and lending finance revenues and operating profits reflect the level and mix of consumer instalment loans 
for  although finance revenues increased due to greater average loans outstanding  operating profit declined primarily due to an increase in the provision for loan losses for the larger volume of loans outstanding 
in addition  results reflected the pre tax gain of  from the sale of substantially all of the company s executive and professional loan portfolio  as well as a decline in automobile loan losses

in  revenues of the plastics division reached a record level of  an increase of over in addition  despite rising raw material prices  the gross profit increased to  in  the gross profit for the plastics division increased by to  this increase was primarily due to greater sales in most of the division s product lines and lower raw material costs 
the decline in manufacturing revenues in compared to was due to the sale of certain divisions and the discontinuance of certain non performing product lines in and prior years 
other investment and other income in included the gains on sale of caja  the sperry and hutchinson company  inc  and pib  and the gain on sale of an equity interest in an associated company 
investment and other income also increased in due to increased rent income and gains from sales of real estate properties  of which  related to fidei 
during  fidei sold real estate properties  properties remain at december   all of which are currently being marketed for sale

in  investment and other income increased by  primarily due to increased interest income  the sale of the company s executive and professional loan portfolio referred to above   and increased income from real estate activities  partially offset by reduced gains from sales of real estate and other assets  and reduced income relating to the service business
