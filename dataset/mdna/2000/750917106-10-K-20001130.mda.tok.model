item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements  including without limitation the company s expectations regarding revenues  expenses and results of operations 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from the company s recent results or those projected in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those discussed in factors affecting future results and below 
the company assumes no obligation to update the forward looking statements or such factors 
overview since its founding in  rambus has been engaged in the development of high speed chip to chip interface technology 
the company neither manufactures nor sells semiconductors but  rather  licenses its technology on a nonexclusive and worldwide basis to semiconductor companies which manufacture memory and logic ics incorporating rambus interface technology 
these ics are sold to systems companies to enhance the performance and cost effectiveness of consumer electronics  computer systems and other electronic systems 
systems companies are not required to obtain a rambus license to incorporate rambus technology into their products 
revenues 
the company generates revenues from two types of licenses 
the first  for technology which is fully compatible with the rambus standard rdram compatible licenses  allows semiconductor manufacturers to manufacture and sell rdrams and logic ics containing rambus asic cells racs to systems companies which have adopted rambus technology 
the second type of license sdram compatible licenses  covers the use of rambus patents and other intellectual property in non rambus ics  specifically in synchronous dram sdram and double data rate ddr sdram memory devices and logic ics which control such memory 
revenues from rdram compatible licenses consist of contract fees and royalties 
contract fees from rdram compatible licenses are comprised of license fees  engineering service fees and nonrefundable  prepaid royalties  and represented approximately of the company s total revenues in fiscal  in  and in the company s rdram compatible licenses generally require a licensee to pay a contract fee to rambus typically ranging from a few hundred thousand dollars for a narrow license covering a single logic product to millions of dollars for a license with broad coverage of rambus technology 
part of these fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as provision of certain deliverables by rambus or production of chips by the licensee 
all contract fees are nonrefundable 
in accordance with the terms of a few rdram compatible licenses  the company received nonrefundable  prepaid royalties which offset the earliest royalty payments otherwise due from the licensee 
as of september   million of such nonrefundable  prepaid royalties had offset initial royalties  and the company had a balance of  remaining to be offset against future royalties 
substantially all of the license fees  engineering service fees and nonrefundable  prepaid royalties from rdram compatible licenses are bundled together as contract fees because the company generally does not provide or price these components separately 
these contracts also generally include rights to upgrades and enhancements 
accordingly  rambus recognizes contract revenues ratably over the period during which post contract customer support is expected to be provided 
the excess of contract fees received over revenue recognized is shown on the company s balance sheet as deferred revenue 
sdram compatible licenses also generally provide for the payment of license fees as well as quarterly royalties 
however  there are no upgrades  enhancements or other customer support provided for these licenses 
the license fees  which generally are millions of dollars  include compensation for use of rambus patents from the time the company notifies the licensee of potential infringement 
accordingly  rambus classifies these fees as royalty revenues which are recognized ratably over the five year contract period 
the excess of sdram compatible license fees received over royalty revenue recognized is shown on the company s balance sheet as deferred revenue 
as of september   the company s deferred revenue from both rdram compatible and sdram compatible licenses was million  substantially all of which is scheduled to be recognized in varying amounts over the next five years 
royalties  which are generally a percentage of the revenues received by licensees on their sales of licensed ics  are normally payable quarterly by a rambus licensee on sales occurring during the life of the rambus patents being licensed in the case of rdram compatible licenses  and over a five year contract period in the case of sdram compatible licenses 
rambus recognizes royalties from a licensee in the quarter in which it receives the report detailing shipments of rambus ics by such licensee in the prior quarter 
for a typical systems application of rambus technology  the company receives royalties from the sale of both licensed logic ics and drams as they are shipped by rambus licensees 
royalty rates range up to a maximum of approximately for rdrams and a maximum of approximately for associated rambus logic ics  and in some cases may decline based on the passage of time or on the total volume of rambus ics shipped 
in the case of sdram compatible licenses  the royalty rates for sdrams and associated controllers are generally less than the comparable rdram compatible rates  and for ddr and associated controllers the rates are generally higher 
the exact rate and structure of a royalty arrangement with a particular licensee depend on a number of factors  including the amount of the license fee to be paid by the licensee and  in the case of rdram compatible licenses  the marketing and engineering commitment made by the licensee 
as of september   the company had rdram compatible licensees and four sdram compatible licensees 
because all of the company s revenues are derived from its relatively small number of licensees  the company s revenues tend to be highly concentrated 
in fiscal   and  revenues from the company s top five licensees accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenues  respectively 
in fiscal   and nec accounted for approximately  and of revenues  respectively 
also in fiscal  toshiba and samsung accounted for and of revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  two other licensees accounted for and of revenues 
the company expects that it will continue to experience significant revenue concentration for the foreseeable future 
however  the particular licensees which account for revenue concentration may vary from period to period depending on the addition of new contracts  the expiration of deferred revenue schedules under existing contracts  and the volumes and prices at which the licensees sell rambus ics to systems companies in any given period 
the royalties received by the company are also partially a function of the adoption of rambus technology by systems companies and the acceptance of the systems companies products by end users 
the company generally does not have a direct contractual relationship with systems companies  and the royalty reports submitted by the company s licensees generally do not disclose the identity of  or unit volume of rambus ics purchased by  particular systems companies 
as a result  it is difficult for the company to predict the extent to which its future revenues will be dependent upon particular systems companies 
in fiscal   and  international revenues constituted  and of the company s total revenues  respectively 
the company expects that revenues derived from international licensees will continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenues in the future 
all of the revenues from international licensees to date have been denominated in united states dollars 
expenses 
since the company s inception in  its engineering costs which consist of cost of contract revenues and research and development expenses and marketing  general and administrative expenses have continually increased as the company has added personnel and ramped up its activities in these areas 
engineering costs and marketing  general and administrative expenses generally have decreased as a percentage of revenues throughout this period due to the relatively rapid revenue base expansion which the company experienced as it began entering into license agreements 
the company intends to continue making significant expenditures associated with engineering  marketing  general and administration  and expects that these costs and expenses will continue to be a significant percentage of revenues in future periods 
whether such expenses increase or decrease as a percentage of revenues will be substantially dependent upon the rate at which the company s revenues change 
engineering costs are allocated between cost of contract revenues and research and development expenses 
cost of contract revenues is determined based on the portion of engineering costs which have been incurred during the period for the adaptation of rambus interface technology for specific rdram compatible licensee processes 
the balance of engineering costs  incurred for general development of rambus technology  is charged to research and development 
in a given period  the allocation of engineering costs between these two components is a function of the timing of development and implementation cycles 
as a generation of technology matures from the development stage through implementation  the majority of engineering costs shifts from research and development expenses to cost of contract revenues 
engineering costs are recognized as incurred and do not correspond to the recognition of revenues under the related contracts 
marketing  general and administrative expenses include salaries  travel expenses and costs associated with trade shows  advertising  legal  finance and other marketing and administrative efforts 
costs of technical support for systems companies  including applications engineering  are also charged to marketing  general and administrative expense 
consistent with the company s business model  sales and marketing activities are focused on developing relationships with potential licensees and on participating with existing licensees in marketing  sales and technical efforts directed to systems companies 
in many cases  rambus must dedicate substantial resources to the marketing and support of systems companies 
due to the long business development cycles faced by the company and the semi fixed nature of administrative expenses  marketing  general and administrative expenses in a given period generally are unrelated to the level of revenues in that period or in recent or future periods 
taxes 
the company reports certain items of income and expense for financial reporting purposes in different years than they are reported in the tax return 
specifically  the company reports contract fees and royalties when received for tax purposes  as required by tax law 
for financial reporting purposes  the company records revenues from rdram compatible contract fees over the period post contract customer support is expected to be provided and from sdram compatible license fees over the five year contract period and records royalty revenues upon notification from licensees 
thus  the company recognizes revenue earlier for tax than for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  the company s net operating profit or loss for tax purposes may be more or less than the amount recorded for financial reporting purposes 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations revenues contract revenues royalties total revenues costs and expenses cost of contract revenues research and development marketing  general and administrative employee stock related compensation expense total costs and expenses operating income loss other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss revenues 
revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
contract revenues increased to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal the majority of the increase in contract revenues in fiscal represents recognition of the remaining revenue on contracts for which all remaining obligations were terminated by mutual consent due to the licensees withdrawal from the commodity dram market 
such a termination results in the cancellation of all obligations on rdram development by both parties 
since all license and engineering payments already received are nonrefundable  the deferred revenue balance on these contracts of approximately million was recognized upon termination in fiscal fiscal contract revenues include approximately  of such previously deferred revenue from cancellation of a contract by rambus due to nonperformance of a licensee 
also contributing to the revenue increase in both fiscal and fiscal was a change in management s estimate of certain contract revenue recognition periods  which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal such periods are initially estimated based upon management s judgment of the time over which the company has an obligation to support its rdram compatible licensees 
as the new generation of rdram compatible technology went into production late in fiscal  a more accurate estimate of the remaining support period could be made 
to the extent the new estimated periods were less than the original estimates  the amount of deferred revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in fiscal was greater than in the comparable periods of prior years 
in fiscal  this increase was partially offset by the ending of revenue recognition on contracts for which the contract period had expired  including the texas instruments ti dram contract 
fiscal included approximately million of contract revenue from the ti dram contract 
this revenue was recognized on an accelerated basis due to the sale of ti s dram business to micron technology inc and was fully recognized by the end of fiscal the company anticipates continuing to book additional contracts  especially contracts with existing licensees for newer versions of rambus technology 
however  it is anticipated that contract revenues will decline over time as the value of contracts for which the revenue recognition periods have expired exceeds the value of new contracts 
the company s past success in signing licensees has reduced the number of potential new licensees  which also contributes to the anticipated decline in contract revenues 
in fiscal  royalties increased to million  or of total revenues 
fiscal revenues include increased royalties from licensees shipments of rdrams and controllers that connect to rdrams rdram compatible ics as well as the first ever royalties from licensees for the use of rambus intellectual property in sdrams  ddr sdrams and logic products which directly control these memories sdram compatible ics 
the company believes that fiscal royalties from rdram compatible ics were largely based upon shipments into the desktop pc  workstation  and sony playstation markets and  to a lesser extent  shipments of previous generation rambus ics for nintendo systems 
in fiscal  royalties decreased to million  or of total revenues 
the company believes that this decrease was a result of declining sales and or prices for the rdram compatible ics used by nintendo as well as steep price declines in the dram market 
the company anticipates that its potential to generate rdram compatible royalties in fiscal will be largely dependent upon system sales by pc and workstation manufacturers and sony 
the markets addressed by systems companies using rambus ics  including those in the video game console and pc businesses  are characterized by extreme volatility  frequent new product introductions and rapidly shifting consumer preferences  and there can be no assurance as to the unit volumes of rambus ics that will be purchased in the future or the level of royalty bearing revenues that the company will receive due to these applications 
none of the systems companies currently incorporating rdram compatible technology into their products is contractually obligated to continue using rambus ics 
given the concentration of royalties from a limited number of sources  it is likely that royalties will continue to vary greatly from period to period 
engineering costs 
engineering costs  consisting of cost of contract revenues and research and development expenses  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  which represented  and of revenues in the same periods  respectively 
the increase in engineering costs was primarily attributable to engineering personnel added to support the launch of rdram compatible technology into the pc main memory market  the company s announced technology roadmap improvements  and new initiatives in the communications market and chip to chip connections 
the decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily the result of the company s growth in revenues 
cost of contract revenues 
cost of contract revenues were million  million and million  which represented  and of revenues  in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  cost of contract revenues declined in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues due to a reduction in the engineering effort required to support the launch and ramp of rdram compatible technology into the pc main memory market as well as the effect of the increase in revenues 
in fiscal  cost of contract revenues increased to million  and increased as a percentage of revenues  as the company focused its engineering resources on the ramp of rdram compatible technology into the pc main memory market 
the company believes that the level of cost of contract revenues will continue to fluctuate in the future  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  as new generations of rambus ics go through the normal development and implementation phases 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million  which represented  and of revenues  in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  research and development expenses increased compared to as the company was able to shift engineering resources from support of the pc market ramp to development of technology roadmap improvements as well as new chip connection activities 
however  research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues in fiscal due to the increase in the company s revenues 
research and development expenses include approximately  of deferred compensation costs and amortization related to the company s fiscal purchase of the intellectual property assets of a small company responsible for developing a serdes cell for network applications 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  which resulted in goodwill and deferred compensation costs that are being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
in fiscal  research and development expenses decreased compared to  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues  as engineering resources were transferred to the support of intel  rdram licensees  pc oems and infrastructure providers on the ramp of rdram compatible technology into the pc main memory market 
the company expects research and development expenses to increase over time as it enhances and improves its technology and applies it to new generations of ics 
the rate of increase of  and the percentage of revenues represented by  research and development expenses in the future will vary from period to period based on the research and development projects underway and the change in engineering headcount in any given period  as well as the rate of change in the company s total revenues 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  which represented  and of revenues  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the addition of administrative personnel and legal fees to support enforcement of the company s patents and other intellectual property rights 
the decrease in marketing  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal reflects the increased revenue base 
the fiscal increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to a buildup of the marketing and sales teams in both the us and japan as well as increased costs associated with applications engineering and other technical support provided to systems companies 
the company expects marketing  general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as the company focuses additional resources upon protecting its intellectual property rights through legal activities  marketing its technology  and assisting systems companies with adapting this technology to new generations of products 
the rate of increase of  and the percentage of revenues represented by  marketing  general and administrative expenses in the future will vary from period to period based on the trade shows  advertising  legal and other marketing and administrative activities undertaken and the change in sales  marketing and administrative headcount in any given period  as well as the rate of change in the company s total revenues 
employee stock related compensation expense 
as discussed below in the section entitled contingent warrants  common stock equivalents  and options  a million employee stock related compensation charge was taken in fiscal related to common stock equivalents granted to the company s chief executive officer and president and options granted to the company s employees 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income from the company s short term cash investments 
other income  net was million  million and million  which represented  and of revenues  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was due to the combination of higher interest rates and higher invested balances 
the company expects interest income to increase in the future due to higher cash balances 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal  and a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal and million in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined  based upon its continued and growing profitability  that it would more likely than not be able to utilize its deferred tax assets  and recorded a million credit to income tax expense to reduce the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
for the and provisions  the estimated federal and state combined rate on income before income taxes was and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to timing differences related to the recognition of contract and royalty revenues and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes 
at september   the company had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million  primarily relating to the difference between tax and book treatment of employee stock related compensation expenses and deferred revenue  and net operating losses 
the deferred tax assets of approximately million  net of the valuation allowance of million  as of september  represents management s estimate of those tax assets which it believes will more likely than not a probability of just over fifty percent be realized 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is subject to periodic adjustment as facts and circumstances warrant 
common stock split in march  the company s board of directors approved a four for one split of rambus common stock  subject to stockholder approval of an increase in authorized common stock 
on may   the company s stockholders approved an increase in the company s authorized shares of common stock to million shares 
the stock began trading on a split adjusted basis on june  all references in this form k to earnings per share  the number of common shares  contingent warrants  common stock equivalents  and options  and the share price have been retroactively restated to reflect the common stock split and the increase in authorized common stock 
contingent warrants  common stock equivalents  and options in january  the company granted a warrant to intel corporation for the purchase of  shares of rambus common stock at an exercise price of per share the intel warrant 
this warrant will become exercisable only upon the achievement of certain milestones by intel relating to shipment volumes of rambus based chipsets the intel milestones 
the warrant will expire no later than the eighth th anniversary of its issuance 
at the time that achievement of the milestones becomes probable  a non cash charge will be made to the statement of operations based on the fair value of the warrant 
in october  the company s board of directors authorized an incentive program in the form of warrants for a total of up to  shares of rambus common stock the dram incentive warrants to be issued to various rambus direct dram partners upon the achievement of certain product qualification and volume production targets 
the warrants  issuable at the time the targets are met  have an exercise price of per share and a life of five years 
they will vest and become exercisable on the same basis as the intel warrant  which will result in a non cash charge to the statement of operations based on the fair value of the warrants at the time the achievement of the intel milestones becomes probable 
as of september   a total of  of these warrants had been issued 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company granted to its chief executive officer and to its president a combined total of  common stock equivalents cses and to its employees approximately  options to purchase rambus common stock for per share 
vesting of these cses and options was contingent upon the achievement of key indicators of success for rambus 
vesting for a portion of these cses and options was contingent on an increase in the price of rambus common stock to greater than per share for consecutive days 
this target was achieved by the end of the second quarter of fiscal  and resulted in a million employee stock related compensation charge taken in the same quarter 
except for a million employer payroll tax liability  this was a non cash charge 
the remaining cses and options will vest on the same basis as the intel and dram incentive warrants  which will result in another almost entirely non cash charge to the statement of operations based on the fair value of the cses and options at the time achievement of the intel milestones becomes probable 
the magnitude of these charges is a function of the current price of rambus common stock at the time the charges are taken 
for example  if these warrants  cses  and options were valued based upon a stock price of  the charge could be million or more 
the charge  when and if taken  will be non cash except for payroll tax liabilities  which would likely be more than offset by cash received by the company upon exercise of the warrants and options 
liquidity and capital resources as of september  the company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  including restricted cash of million and a long term component of million 
as of the same date  the company had total working capital of million  including a short term component of deferred revenue of million 
deferred revenue represents the excess of cash received from licensees over revenue recognized on license contracts  and the short term component represents the amount of this deferred revenue expected to be recognized over the next twelve months 
without the short term component of deferred revenue  working capital would have been million at september  the company s operating activities provided net cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash generated by fiscal operations was primarily the result of net loss and deferred taxes offset by non cash items  primarily non cash stock compensation expense 
cash generated in was primarily from net income and income tax adjustments  offset by a decrease in deferred revenue due to recognition of contract revenues in excess of new billings 
cash generated in fiscal was primarily the result of net income and increases in deferred revenue  offset by net payments  provisions and adjustments relating to income taxes 
the increase in deferred revenue was due to new billings on license contracts in excess of revenues recognized 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
investing activities have consisted primarily of net purchases and maturities of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment and investments 
net cash provided by financing activities were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
proceeds from the sale of common stock under the company s employee stock purchase and option plans are the primary source of net cash provided by financing activities 
the company presently anticipates that existing cash balances will be adequate to meet its cash needs for at least the next months 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that all derivatives be recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position  and that the corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income  depending on the type of hedging relationship that exists 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
sfas deferred the effective date of sfas until the first fiscal quarter of fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not currently hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
the company expects the adoption of sfas and sfas in the first quarter of fiscal year will have no material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to revenue recognition in financial statements and is effective in the fourth quarter of all fiscal years beginning after december  the company s accounting policies are consistent with the requirements of sab  so the implementation of sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal year is not expected to have an impact on the company s operating results 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin is effective for transactions occurring after july  the application of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio 
the company places its investments with high credit issuers and by policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in its policy  the company will ensure the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
the company has no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore is not subject to foreign exchange risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity
