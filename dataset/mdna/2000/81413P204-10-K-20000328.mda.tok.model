for more detail  see risk factors at the end of item overview the results of operations for each of security capital s reportable segments  the capital division and the financial services division  are discussed below 
these two sections are followed by a discussion of security capital s liquidity and capital resources 
all three of these sections should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
results of operations capital division earnings from the capital division are generated by its strategic investments 
the majority of these investments are not consolidated and the capital division reports its share of their respective earnings 
the consolidated investments include homestead which is the largest consolidated investment  belmont  sc european real estate shares  and sc us real estate shares 
cash flow for the capital division is generated through receipt of dividends and interest payments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for detail of dividends received 
results for were significantly impacted by changes in the equity in earnings from strategic investees  the sale of security capital s position in strategic hotel and an additional investment in homestead 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees the equity in earnings of the capital division s unconsolidated investees includes changes in unrealized gains or losses for sc us realty and sc preferred growth 
these changes are generated as a result of fluctuating market prices for the shares in their underlying investments and are reflected in earnings due to sc us realty s and sc preferred growth s use of fair value accounting 
fluctuations in market prices do not have an impact on cash flow  but the general decline in real estate equity security prices in and had a materially adverse impact on security capital s equity in earnings of sc us realty 
presented below is security capital s equity in earnings loss for the years ended december    and dollar amounts in millions and security capital s common share ownership interest in unconsolidated affiliates as of december   and explanations of earnings changes at the investee level  which materially impacted security capital s equity in earnings  follow the table 
equity in earnings ownership as loss year ended of december december   archstone prologis sc european realty sc preferred growth sc us sc us strategic hotel earnings interest income archstone atlantic was merged into archstone in july for purposes of this table  the results of archstone and atlantic are combined for the years ended december  and archstone s increase in earnings for compared to was due primarily to an increase in rental rates and improvement in operating margins 
the earnings increase in compared to was primarily due to a one time  non cash expense of million in related to archstone s acquisition of its reit and property management companies from security capital 
an increase in gains on dispositions of real estate  and increases in properties owned and average rents also contributed to the overall earnings increase in prologis in march  prologis merged with meridian industrial trust 
the shares issued by prologis to complete the merger reduced security capital s ownership position from at year end to at year end security capital continues to be prologis largest shareholder 
prologis increase in earnings for over was primarily due to an increase in income generated by prologis unconsolidated subsidiaries which provide temperature controlled storage and build to suit services and a increase in the square footage of distribution facilities owned 
the increase in earnings for compared to was due primarily to a one time non cash expense of million related to prologis acquisition of its reit and property management companies from security capital 
properties owned and average rents also increased from to sc european realty sc european realty commenced operations in april therefore  the primary reason for its improved results in compared to was a full year of operations in security capital s weighted average investment increased to million in from million in sc european realty s current investments are primarily in operating and development companies with significant pre stabilized assets 
it is expected that earnings for sc european realty will increase as additional properties reach stabilization 
however  there is no assurance that this will occur and failure to do so would impair the ability of sc european realty to grow both its portfolio and its earnings 
sc preferred growth sc preferred growth s change in earnings for the years ended  and was due primarily to changes in unrealized gains or losses on investments and increases in sc preferred growth s weighted average net assets at fair value 
sc preferred growth s weighted average net assets at fair value were million in  million in and million in the market value of sc preferred growth s investments declined by million in compared to a million decline in value for and a million increase in the overall improvement for was partially offset by a realized loss of million on the disposition of an investment 
sc us realty sc us realty experienced losses for the years ended and compared to earnings for the and losses resulted primarily from the overall decrease in market prices for the shares in its underlying investments 
the portfolio of strategic long term investments experienced a million market value decline in  a million market value decline in and a million market value increase in sc us realty realized a million loss on the sale of its special opportunity investment portfolio in see part i business significant developments during  for further details and experienced a million market value decline in and a million market value increase in net investment income defined as dividends and other investment income net of administrative expenses  advisor fees  taxes and interest was million  million and million for the years ended   and respectively 
the decline in net investment income during compared to is primarily related to decreased dividend income from the special opportunity investment portfolio due to the sale of this portfolio throughout during  security capital s ownership position in sc us realty increased from to as sc us realty repurchased approximately of its outstanding shares 
security capital made an additional investment in sc us realty of million in strategic hotel in september  security capital sold its entire ownership in strategic hotel for net proceeds of approximately million 
this sale generated a loss of million and a capital loss tax benefit of million  of which million was used in see income tax discussion 
the sale proceeds were used to reduce security capital s line of credit balance and to fund share and debenture repurchases 
as a result of the sale  equity in earnings from strategic hotel were not recorded after the second quarter of consolidated investments homestead early in  homestead s management determined that financing for previously planned development activity was not available 
furthermore  initial operating results were below management s expectations due to lower than forecasted occupancy levels 
security capital s vice chairman  c 
ronald blankenship  became interim chairman and chief executive officer of homestead  and james c 
potts was elevated to chief operating officer 
together  they established three primary objectives reduction of debt through land sales  reduction in operating costs  and improved property level operating margins 
a special charge of million was recorded in the second quarter of for write downs of land held for sale  write offs of costs of pursuing other land parcels and the costs of severance of personnel 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details of the special charge 
additionally  homestead completed a rights offering of common shares for net proceeds of million of which security capital acquired 
consistent with the three primary objectives  homestead made a decision to curtail the development activity that was in planning stages at the time of its change in management 
as of december   homestead had sold million of the original million of land held for sale 
total debt decreased from million at december  to million at december   and annualized overhead costs decreased from million at the end of the first quarter of to million in the first quarter of the following table sets forth the results of homestead s operations by quarter in and in total for and it should be noted that homestead s business is seasonal and lower occupancy and revenues for the fourth quarter are typical 
homestead total portfolio q q q q operating properties average occupancy average weekly rate weekly revpar property operating margin all amounts are annual averages except operating properties  which are as of year end 
management targets an operating margin of to  but there are no assurances that such margins will be achieved 
overall property level results for homestead are summarized below for the years ended  and in millions total room revenue total room expense net operating income the increase in net operating income from to was due to an increase in the number of operating facilities as well as the restructuring of operations discussed above 
the increase in net operating income from to was due primarily to an increase in the number of operating facilities 
the annual increase in properties from to  and again from to  was the primary reason for security capital s consolidated increase in depreciation from million in to million in and million in belmont the first belmont community in houston opened in subsequent openings included nashville and louisville in and memphis in january construction is underway on four additional sites 
all of belmont s activities currently involve developmental activities and ownership of properties that are pre stabilized 
realized and unrealized gains and losses realized capital gains increased by million from to this increase was due primarily to a gain on the sale of securities held by sc us real estate shares 
these sales also contributed to million in lower investments in publicly traded securities held as of december   compared to december  the change in unrealized gains or losses is a direct result of changing real estate security prices 
such change was a decrease of million in  a decrease of million in and an increase of million in interest expense consolidated interest expense was million in  million in and million in the increase from to was due to an increase in average long term debt outstanding from million in to million in and higher interest expense at homestead as no interest was capitalized after the curtailment of development activity during the second quarter of the decrease in from was due primarily to the conversion of million principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures due to class a shares during the fourth quarter of preferred share dividends preferred share dividends for   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in and increase in was due to a million non cash dividend incurred in in conjunction with the exchange of series a preferred shares and certain class b shares for series b preferred shares 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
ebdadt earnings before depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes  or ebdadt  is considered by management to be an additional measure of operating performance for security capital and its affiliates  supplementing net earnings as measured by gaap 
among other things  gaap net earnings includes the impact of real estate depreciation 
the value of the real estate assets generally changes in response to existing market conditions and does not necessarily diminish in value predictably over time  as historical cost depreciation implies 
therefore  consistent with real estate industry practice  ebdadt adjusts gaap net earnings by eliminating real estate related depreciation 
ebdadt also involves certain other adjustments as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the most material being the omission of changes in unrealized gains and losses on real estate securities due to fluctuations in market prices 
ebdadt should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or any other gaap measurement of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities  or as a measure of security capital s liquidity 
capital division ebdadt reflects equity in ebdadt before extraordinary items from investees  less allocated general and administrative expenses  interest expense  taxes and depreciation 
ebdadt results before special items for the capital division are presented in the following chart capital division ebdadt in millions 
line chart 
favorable ebdadt performance before special items of the capital division for compared to before special items is primarily attributed to improved operating performance by substantially all investees as described above 
sc us realty s equity in ebdadt increased by in primarily due to increased operating performance of its investees and increased by in primarily due to additional capital deployed by sc us realty into its investees  as well as improved operating performance of its investees 
equity in ebdadt for sc us realty differs from gaap equity in earnings because gaap equity in earnings reflects changes in fair value of investments  whereas ebdadt does not sc us realty s ebdadt instead reflects the ebdadt performance of its investees 
increases in ebdadt were partially offset by severance and other costs that will result in future savings and an increase in interest expense 
annualized overhead for the capital division decreased from million at year end to million at year end due to changes in strategic focus see part  business and related re allocations of capital  the capital division also incurred the following special items for the years ended  and management does not believe these items relate to continuing operating performance amounts in millions 
homestead s special charges related to land write downs  employee severance and other expenses related to curtailing its development program 
security capital s special charge related to overhead reductions 
loss on sale of strategic hotel 
realized gains losses on intermediate term investments 
extraordinary gain on retirement of debt capital division ebdadt for  and  inclusive of the special items  was million  million and million  respectively 
improvements in ebdadt from to were due primarily to increased equity in ebdadt resulting from increased investments by the capital division and improved operating performance by investees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of ebdadt 
financial services division the primary components of the financial services division are the capital markets group and the global capital management group 
these two groups are the financial services division s primary earnings generators 
in addition  the corporate services group and the real estate research group enable security capital and its affiliates to consolidate certain activities for economies of scale 
all fees paid by affiliates to the financial services division are included for ebdadt purposes 
revenues for the financial services division are presented in the following table for the years ended december   and in millions revenues capital markets group global capital management group corporate services group real estate research group reit and property management fees sub total less amounts eliminated in consolidation total the decline in real estate security prices in and has made it more difficult to attract assets to security capital s mutual funds and investees  and to execute capital markets transactions  which has  in turn  impacted revenues for the global capital management group and the capital markets group 
additionally  the decline in real estate securities prices in and reduced the value of assets under management in some of security capital s managed entities  thereby decreasing fee income to the global capital management group for managing such entities 
any reduced growth could be partially offset  over the long term  by increases in other financial services division revenues as security capital continues to expand in this area  although no assurance of this growth can be given 
in spite of these negative market conditions and a general decline in real estate security prices  the global capital management group experienced an overall increase in assets under management from to due to an increase in third party assets to be managed  thereby leading to an increase in fee revenue 
assets under management for the global capital management group as of december   and  are presented in the following table in millions sc european realty   sc preferred growth sc us sc us    mutual funds other costs relating to personnel and overhead reductions also affected the operating results of the financial services division 
annualized overhead for the financial services division was reduced from million at year end to million at year end security capital expects overhead to be significantly lower in than in revenues and expenses for the financial services division for compared to decreased primarily as a result of archstone and prologis becoming internally managed by acquiring the financial services division subsidiaries of security capital which had previously managed these companies 
the impact on revenues of this sale was partially offset by a growth in assets under management  an increase in capital markets fees  and increased revenue for corporate and real estate research services 
in  the financial services division incurred a million fourth quarter special charge for overhead and other cost reductions due to a change in strategy related to the retail distribution of real estate mutual funds and a reduction of personnel and associated costs 
ebdadt financial services division ebdadt reflects allocations of security capital s g a  taxes and depreciation 
ebdadt results for the years ended december    and were as follows in millions capital markets group global capital management group corporate services group real estate research group income tax expense ebdadt before special items the ebdadt information reflects pro forma data  assuming the september   exchange of security capital s reit management and property management companies for common shares of prologis and archstone occurred as of the beginning of and excluding interest expense on the convertible subordinated debentures due  as they were converted to class a shares prior to december  ebdadt results for all years can be attributed to the same factors that impacted financial services division revenues and expenses  as discussed above 
other items the following items are not specific to either the capital division or financial services division  but had an impact on operations as a whole 
general  administrative and other expenses general  administrative and other expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease from to resulted primarily from personnel reductions and other cost controls by security capital and homestead 
the increase from to was from additional personnel and related costs and homestead s special charge related to a reduction in development activity 
security capital s share of homestead s fourth quarter special charge for was million  which is reflected in capital division ebdadt above 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax benefit was of loss from operations for  which is less than the us statutory tax rate of 
the tax benefit was lower than the statutory rate because losses at consolidated subsidiaries which were not consolidated for tax purposes can only be recognized when the subsidiary is sold or through taxable income generated by the subsidiary and capital losses generated from the sale of strategic hotel can only be used to offset future capital gains 
in addition  income from foreign subsidiaries is taxed at a rate lower than the us statutory tax rate 
the effective tax rate in was of the operating loss  which approximates the statutory tax rate 
while the effective tax rate approximates the statutory rate  the provision was increased due to the non deductibility of certain warrant issuances offset by the utilization of prior years net operating losses 
security capital s tax basis in its strategic investees at december   was as follows in thousands archstone  prologis  sc european realty  sc us sc us  gain on sale of reit and property managers prior to september  security capital managed the operations and provided property management services to various reits archstone  atlantic and prologis in which security capital was a significant owner 
effective september   security capital exchanged the subsidiaries that provided the management services for additional common shares of archstone  shares  atlantic  shares and prologis  shares and recorded a gain of million 
extraordinary items in there were extraordinary gains on early extinguishments of debt  net of minority interest  totaling million 
the first  amounting to million  related to the repurchase of million principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures due by security capital 
the second  amounting to million  related to full settlement of a finders fee liability by homestead 
the million extraordinary loss in on the early extinguishment of debt  net of minority interest  relates to a mortgage loan purchase agreement entered into by homestead with atlantic and merrill lynch mortgage capital inc see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these items 
liquidity and capital resources investment activity security capital s investment activity primarily consists of allocation redemptions of its capital to its various affiliates 
the following table summarizes security capital s capital allocations to and redemptions of its primary investments for the years ended december   and in millions prologis sc european realty sc preferred growth sc us sc us strategic hotel publicly traded real estate securities homestead warrants real estate investments homestead belmont homestead proceeds from sale of land in  security capital also invested million in homestead village common stock  which is not reflected in the financial statements due to its elimination in consolidation 
real estate investments reflect development activity at homestead and belmont 
financing activity security capital reduced its total debt from billion at year end to billion at year end this decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in line of credit balances by million 
in addition  the following financing transactions occurred in security capital 
issuance of million of senior unsecured notes 
repurchase of million principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures due for million 
repurchase of million of security capital common stock discussed below homestead 
sale and lease back of properties which generated million of proceeds 
repayment of million of mortgage notes at year end  homestead had an outstanding balance of million on its lines of credit compared to million at year end homestead s lines of credit reductions were primarily accomplished with million in proceeds from land sales and million in proceeds from a rights offering of common stock 
subsequent to year end homestead has made payments totaling million on the bank line of credit reducing its line of credit debt to million 
on february   homestead entered into an amended and restated bank credit facility which allows for million of total borrowings of which million is available on a revolving basis 
the amended and restated line matures february   bears interest at libor plus  is secured by operating properties  permits payment of dividends based upon a definition of free cash flow  and requires maintenance of financial ratio and coverage covenants 
total debt at year end was billion compared to million at year end this net increase was primarily a result of the following financing transactions 
increases in borrowings under the lines of credit of million 
the issuance of million of senior unsecured notes  and 
proceeds from the sale of common stock by homestead to minority interest holders of million  offset by homestead s payment to extinguish debt of million 
excluding homestead and belmont  security capital s year end debt to total capitalization ratio was 
the average maturity of security capital s billion of fixed rate indebtedness excluding homestead and belmont is years  at an average fixed rate of 
the maximum maturity in any year is million in cash from operations due to higher average debt outstanding and higher average interest rates  consolidated interest expense increased from million in to million in as discussed previously 
this increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in dividends received from archstone and prologis from to the net increase  along with reduced capital markets fees  was the primary cause for the decrease in consolidated cash from operations from million in to million in the debt reductions and overhead reductions described above are expected to result in higher cash from operations in cash provided by operating activities increased by million in compared to this increase is primarily due to a million increase in distributions from unconsolidated investees and a million increase in net non cash items 
the non cash items are related to the equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees  provision for deferred taxes  the change in unrealized gain or loss on investments  depreciation and amortization and the gain on sale of management companies in the third quarter of stock and debenture repurchase programs in  security capital used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of strategic hotel and internal cash flow to repurchase its common stock 
as of march   security capital had repurchased  shares of class b common stock equivalents for a purchase price of million comprised of  class a shares and  class b shares 
as of march   security capital also repurchased million principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures due in for million 
security capital s board has authorized a total amount of million for the common share repurchase program and million for the debenture repurchase program 
derivative financial instruments as of year end and  security capital had no derivative financial instruments 
future capital commitments and liquidity security capital and its subsidiaries have a remaining funding commitment of million to sc european realty  as of december  in addition  as of december   security capital has committed to invest an additional million in belmont 
on march   security capital announced a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of homestead common stock it does not already own for per share in cash 
the aggregate value of the transaction would be approximately million  funds would be provided under security capital s revolving line of credit 
the homestead board is expected to form a special committee consisting of independent members of the homestead board to consider security capital s proposal 
security capital may amend or withdraw the proposal at any time in its sole discretion and  therefore  there are no assurances that the transaction will be consummated 
security capital expects that cash flows from operations and funds currently available under its revolving line of credit will be sufficient to enable security capital to satisfy its anticipated cash requirements for operations and currently committed investments 
in the longer term  security capital intends to finance its business activities through the selective sale of assets  internally generated cash flow  its line of credit  and future issuance of equity and debt securities 
the business activities to be financed may include investments in new business initiatives  additional investments in certain existing affiliates and additional potential repurchases of security capital securities 
homestead believes it will have adequate cash resources from cash on hand and cash flow from operations to fund its future business needs 
however  due to the risks of operation of lodging properties  including competitive pressures  rates  occupancies  and costs of operation  there can be no assurance of adequate future cash flow generation 
in addition  homestead may generate cash flow from the sale of its remaining land sites  but no assurance can be given that such sales will occur or provide significant net proceeds 
year information technology issues the year issue arose as many existing computer programs and chip based embedded technology systems use only the last two digits to refer to a year  and therefore  did not properly recognize a year that began with instead of the familiar 
security capital adopted a year compliance program to minimize or prevent the number and seriousness of any disruptions that could have occurred as a result of the year issue 
third party costs to address the year issue were less than  and internal costs incurred for year compliance issues were also less than  security capital does not anticipate any additional costs related to year no significant year related problems or failures were experienced by security capital prior to or after january  and no significant year problems or failures are anticipated 
risk factors the following matters may affect security capital s future financial performance 
reliance on dividends and earnings of investees most of security capital s cash flow and earnings comes from real estate operating companies in which it owns shares 
security capital is dependent on dividends and fees it receives from these companies to meet its operating expense needs and to pay principal and interest on its debt 
although security capital has influence over these real estate operating companies because of its significant ownership interest and contractual rights  it has a non majority ownership interest and fewer than a majority of the board seats in most of these companies and does not have unilateral control 
security capital could be adversely affected by decisions or actions of investee management 
conflicts of interest transactions with affiliates have occurred and may occur in the future 
several of security capital s directors or senior officers are directors or trustees of its affiliates  or own shares of its affiliates 
those persons may have conflicts of interest in affiliate transactions 
where security capital engages in these types of transactions it has or will obtain disinterested director approval or shareholder approval  when necessary  for transactions in which directors may have a conflict of interest 
neither security capital s charter nor its bylaws contain any restrictions on interested party transactions 
real estate risks risks which are unique to the real estate business  which could materially impact security capital  are 
changes in specific economic conditions or commercial patterns that reduce demand for real estate for example  a recession or change in technology that reduces demand for real estate facilities or which results in bankruptcy of tenants 

changes in tax laws or market conditions that make real estate investment less attractive relative to other investment opportunities 
such changes would reduce the number of buyers for real estate and adversely affect real estate asset values 
selling real estate assets typically takes longer than selling other types of assets  so it is more difficult to anticipate unfavorable changes by selling the affected assets before the change 

changes in tax laws or capital markets  which result in excess capital flowing into new real estate development and excess real estate supply 

when equity and or debt capital is unavailable or expensive for real estate companies as has been the case since mid  security capital is adversely affected  primarily because fee earning capital markets transaction volume suffers  the value of assets under management  on which fees are based  is lower  and the ability to pursue attractive investment opportunities  including new start up companies  is limited and investees in the start up phase may need to reduce activities and incur related charges 
charges resulting from changes in business strategy or restructuring during  security capital incurred two significant charges to earnings from the sale of its interest in strategic hotel and a termination of homestead s development program 
any changes in strategy or market conditions that lead to similar actions in the future could result in similar charges 
investment company act risk security capital is not registered as an investment company under the investment company act of  in reliance on an exemption provided by rule a issued under the investment company act 
security capital is not required to register as an investment company because security capital is principally engaged in the real estate business through companies that it primarily controls 
to the extent security capital and its affiliates do not elect to participate in future equity offerings by its investees or those investees issue substantial additional equity securities in a business combination to unaffiliated parties  security capital s ownership interest in and control over those investees could diminish 
under those circumstances  security capital could potentially be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act 
security capital would suffer additional regulatory costs and expenses  and might be required to discontinue certain operations or investments  if it were required to register as an investment company under the investment company act 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk security capital s exposure to market risks consists of interest rate risk related to its own borrowings and those of its consolidated investments and equity price risk related to its investments in marketable equity securities and its investment in sc us realty  which uses fair value accounting  and sc preferred growth 
security capital s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to mitigate interest rate risk  security capital borrows on a long term basis  primarily at fixed rates and staggered maturities  therefore  security capital s primary interest rate risk is related to its variable rate line of credit loc 
security capital occasionally utilizes derivative financial instruments as hedges in anticipation of future long term debt transactions to manage well defined interest rate risk exposure 
security capital had no outstanding interest rate hedges as of december  or security capital manages its equity price risks by limiting the percentage of its assets invested in marketable equity securities for trading purposes 
as of december  and  less than and less than  respectively  of total assets were invested in marketable equity securities that were available for sale 
sensitivity analysis the table below represents the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on security capital and its consolidated affiliates in millions variable average hypothetical interest rate interest rate impact on exposure balance change earnings security capital loc homestead loc belmont mortgage notes as of december   security capital held million of publicly traded real estate securities at market value through its consolidated mutual funds  sc us real estate shares and sc european real estate shares 
these securities have exposure to price risk 
a hypothetical change in quoted market prices would amount to a change of approximately million in the recorded value of investments 
security capital s combined equity in loss for sc us realty and sc preferred growth was million 
a hypothetical change in the market value of sc us realty s publicly traded investments and sc preferred growth s investments would amount to a million change in security capital s equity in earnings
