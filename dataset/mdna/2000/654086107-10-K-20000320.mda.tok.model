factors affecting business performance the following factors can impact year to year comparisons and may affect the future performance of nicor s businesses 
gas distribution 
nicor gas  a regulated natural gas distribution utility  serves more than million customers in a service territory that encompasses most of the northern third of illinois  excluding the city of chicago 
the region s economy is diverse and has grown steadily over the years  providing nicor gas with a well balanced mix of residential  commercial and industrial customers 
in  residential  commercial and industrial customers accounted for about percent  percent and percent of natural gas deliveries  respectively 
since about one half of gas deliveries are used for space heating  fluctuations in weather can have a significant impact on year to year comparisons of operating income and cash flow 
to provide protection from the financial impact of unusually warm weather  nicor gas purchased a weather insurance policy which will protect earnings and cash flow if weather for the year is more than percent warmer than normal 
in addition to the impact of weather  significant changes in gas prices or economic conditions can impact gas usage 
however  nicor gas large residential customer base provides relative stability during weak economic periods 
also  the industrial and commercial customer base is well diversified  lessening the impact of industry specific economic swings 
nicor gas competes with other energy suppliers based on such factors as price  service and reliability 
the company is well positioned to deal with the possibility of fuel switching by customers because it has rates and services designed to compete against alternative fuels and because of its competitively priced supply of gas 
in addition  the company has a rate which allows negotiation with potential bypass customers  and no customer has bypassed since the rate became effective in nicor gas also offers commercial and industrial customers flexibility and alternatives in rates and service  increasing its ability to compete in these markets 
direct connection to six interstate pipelines and extensive underground storage capacity allow the company to maintain rates that are among the lowest in the nation  while also providing transportation customers with direct access to gas supplies and storage services 
in addition  in an effort to ensure supply reliability  the company purchases gas from several different producing regions under varied contract terms 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nicor gas growth in deliveries has traditionally come from a combination of customer additions and increased usage among existing commercial and industrial customers 
deliveries to power generation facilities have also contributed to growth 
while the company anticipates continued growth in deliveries attributable to these factors  a partial offset is expected by customers installation of more energy efficient equipment 
on january   nicor gas performance based rate pbr plan for natural gas costs went into effect 
under the pbr  nicor gas total gas supply costs will be compared to a benchmark tied to a market index 
savings and losses relative to the benchmark will be shared equally with customers 
transportation customers who are responsible for their own gas supplies are not affected by the pbr plan 
assuming a benchmark of billion  each one percent deviation from the benchmark would affect net income by about million 
at the end of two years  the plan will be subject to icc review 
in another regulatory development  nicor gas received approval from the icc in to expand customer select r  a voluntary pilot program that offers customers a choice of natural gas suppliers 
customer select is in its third year and now all commercial and industrial customers  as well as more than  residential customers in communities  are eligible to participate 
in the program s first two years  about percent of eligible business customers and percent of eligible residential customers signed up 
the choice of another natural gas commodity supplier has no impact on nicor gas operating income  and in all cases  nicor gas continues to deliver the natural gas  read meters  maintain its distribution system  ensure safety and respond to service and emergency calls 
nicor gas supports full customer choice and is presently evaluating providing all customers the ability to choose their natural gas supplier 
in order to generate additional contributions to earnings growth  nicor gas has been pursuing several nontraditional activities 
the chicago area has become a major market hub for natural gas  and demand for storage and transmission related services by marketers  other gas distribution companies and for electric power generation is expected to increase significantly 
in addition  the company continues to assess its nonstrategic real estate holdings  and is evaluating the potential to maximize the value from these holdings through additional property sales or development over the next several years 
nicor gas is regulated by the icc  which establishes the rules and regulations governing utility rates and services in illinois 
rates are generally designed to allow the company to recover its costs and provide an opportunity to earn a fair return for its investors 
further changes in the regulatory environment could affect the longer term performance of nicor gas

through nicor enerchange  the company is building a niche wholesale natural gas marketing business and providing hub management services 
nicor has also utilized its supply assets as part of the nontraditional activities within its regulated gas distribution business 
pipeline projects 
in january  nicor signed an agreement to become an equal partner in the planned horizon pipeline with natural gas pipeline company of america  a subsidiary of kinder morgan  inc the proposed million natural gas pipeline will originate in joliet  illinois and extend miles to mchenry county in northern illinois 
subject to ferc approval  construction of the pipeline will begin in spring of  with completion anticipated in the strategic location of the pipeline will enable nicor to accommodate growth in its traditional gas distribution business  and it will also put the company in excellent position to supply natural gas for the new electric power generation projects being proposed in northern illinois 
power generation opportunities

market risk 
the company is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations  including the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk 
the company has established policies and procedures governing the management of commodity price risks and the use of derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to such risks 
a risk management committee exists to oversee compliance with such policies and procedures 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations concluded nicor s regulated utility  nicor gas  is generally not exposed to market risk caused by changes in commodity prices 
this is due to current illinois rate regulation governing the recovery of all prudently incurred natural gas supply costs from customers 
although the company has a pbr plan for natural gas costs  the plan does not expose the company to commodity price risk because actual gas costs are compared to a market based benchmark as opposed to a fixed benchmark 
additional information about the pbr plan is presented on page nicor s unregulated energy businesses are subject to natural gas commodity price risk  arising primarily from fixed price purchase and sale agreements and gas in storage inventories 
derivative commodity instruments such as futures  options  forwards and swaps may be used to hedge this risk 
open positions are restricted by policy to an immaterial amount 
to manage the credit risk inherent in the company s commodity price risk management programs  the company contracts with creditworthy counterparties and limits its exposure to any one counterparty 
interest rate risk 
the company is also exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of its short and long term debt 
the company manages its interest rate risk primarily by issuing long term fixed rate debt with varying maturities and refinancing certain debt
