jabil is one of the leading worldwide independent providers of turnkey manufacturing services to electronics oems in the communications  computer peripherals  personal computer  automotive and consumer products industries 
during the past several years  jabil has experienced substantial growth in net revenue  operating income and net income 
this growth  as well as the growth of the overall ems industry  has been driven by the increasing number of electronics oems who are outsourcing their manufacturing requirements 
we anticipate that this industry trend will continue during the next several years 
we derive most of our net revenue under purchase orders from oem customers 
we recognize revenue  net of product return and warranty costs  typically at the time of product shipment 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to several factors  including variation in demand for our customers products  our customers inventory management  new product introductions and manufacturing strategy changes  and consolidations among our customers 
demand for our customers products depends on  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory adjustments 
as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services  we are responsible for procuring components and other materials 
this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials  excess scrap and inventory obsolescence  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of a component based on the costs of materials in that product and a component based on the labor and manufacturing overhead allocation to that product 
we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue  and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue 
our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor costs and manufacturing overhead for that product 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor and selling  general and administrative expenses 
gross margins and operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low volume production  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating margins 
as our capacity has grown during recent years  both through the construction of new greenfield facilities and the expansion of existing facilities  our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased to support this growth 
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design  production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 
to support this effort  our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers 
most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue 
in addition  our engineers engage in research and development of new technologies that apply generally to our operations 
the expense of these research and development activities are reflected in the research and development line item in our consolidated financial statements 
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities 
substantially all of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in us dollars  while our labor and utility costs in plants outside the united states are denominated in local currencies 
we typically hedge these local currency costs through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts  the amount and cost of which have not been material 
we continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
significant reductions in sales to any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us  and other customers have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions and expansion on august   we acquired certain assets primarily raw material inventory and property  plant and equipment relating to the laserjet formatter manufacturing organization of hewlett packard company located in bergamo  italy and boise  idaho 
the hp acquisition price was approximately million and was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the acquisition resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million  which are being amortized on a straight line basis over ten years 
the acquired assets were used by the hewlett packard company to manufacture printed circuit board assemblies for the laserjet printer division of hewlett packard company 
simultaneously with the hp acquisition  we entered into a manufacturing agreement to continue to produce the printed circuit board assemblies being produced by the hewlett packard company operations in bergamo and boise 
on september  we acquired  through our jabil global services subsidiary  the net assets of eftc services  inc  an electronic product service and repair business 
jabil global services  inc continues to offer repair and warranty services for existing and future customers from its hub based operations in memphis  tennessee  louisville  kentucky  and tampa  florida 
the purchase price of approximately million was paid in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in approximately million of goodwill  which is being amortized  on a straight line basis over a period of years 
the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of acquisition 
on september  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock for all the outstanding common stock of get manufacturing  inc  a china based electronics manufacturing services provider 
the business combination was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  accordingly  our historical consolidated financial statements presented herein have been restated to include the accounts and results of operations of get manufacturing  inc in connection with the merger  we recorded acquisition related charges of million million after tax and million million after tax in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year  respectively consisting of key employee severance and legal and professional fees associated with the merger 
on february   we acquired the net assets of bull information technology  an electronic manufacturing service provider 
the business operates in the city of contagem  state of minas gerais  in the belo horizonte region brazil 
the purchase price of approximately million was paid in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in approximately million of goodwill  which is being amortized  on a straight line basis over a period of years 
the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of the acquisition 
pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material 
on july  we acquired the share capital of telenor technology services limited  a repair and logistics services division of telenor mobile communications as  a norwegian provider of telecommunication  data and media communication services 
the purchase price of approximately million was paid in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in approximately million of goodwill  which is being amortized  on a straight line basis over a period of years 
the acquired operations allow jabil global services to offer circuit board repair and warranty services for european customers from dublin  ireland 
the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of acquisition 
pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material 
during this fiscal year  we announced greenfield expansions in tiszaujvaros  hungary and chihuahua  mexico 
the hungarian facility is approximately  square feet and is scheduled to begin production in the fall of in chihuahua  two  square foot facilities will be constructed to add capacity in mexico 
we have also announced expansions of existing sites in north america 
the ems industry has experienced rapid growth over the past several years as an increasing number of oems have outsourced their manufacturing requirements 
oems are turning to outsourcing in order to reduce product cost  achieve accelerated time to market and time to volume production  access advanced design and manufacturing technologies  improve inventory management and purchasing power  reduce their capital investment in manufacturing facilities  and achieve parallel manufacturing of the same product throughout the world 
we believe that further growth opportunities exist for ems providers to penetrate the worldwide electronics markets

gives effect to a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend to stockholders of record on march  and on february  liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations from the proceeds of public equity offerings  private placement debt  borrowings on a revolving credit facility and cash generated from operations 
in june  we sold million shares of our common stock  which generated net proceeds to us of approximately million 
also  in march  we sold million shares of our common stock  which generated net proceeds of approximately million to us 
at august  our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and short term investments of million and available borrowings under our credit facility and asset securitization program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended august  was million 
this consisted primarily of million of net income  million of depreciation and amortization  million of increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by million of increases in accounts receivable and million increases in inventories 
the increases in inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable were due to commensurate increases in levels of business 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended august  consisted of our capital expenditures of million for construction and equipment worldwide in order to support increased activities and cash paid of million in the acquisition of eftc services  inc  bull information technology and telenor technology services limited  net of million of proceeds from the sale of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended august  resulted primarily from million in proceeds from our common stock offering  offset in part by the repayment of borrowings on our revolving credit facility and an installment of principal on our private placement debt 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
over the past several years  we have experienced significant growth 
as a result  we have used cash to finance increases in our inventory and accounts receivable 
in the event that we experience similar growth in the future  we may need to finance such growth and any corresponding working capital needs with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility  as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity 
during the quarter ended november   we filed a shelf registration statement registering the potential sale of debt and equity securities in the future from time to time to augment our liquidity and capital resources 
our june offering of million shares of our common stock was made pursuant to that registration statement 
in august  we effectively increased the amount of unissued securities under our shelf registration statement to billion 
in august  we established a million account receivables securitization program with a syndicate of banks which expires in august to date  we have not accessed any funds through that program 
should we do so  we would effectively pay interest on such funds at designated commercial paper rates plus agreed upon margins 
we believe that during fiscal year  our capital expenditures will exceed million  principally for machinery  equipment  facilities and related expenses 
we believe that our level of resources  which include cash on hand  available borrowings  and funds provided by operations  will be more than adequate to fund these capital expenditure and working capital requirements for fiscal factors affecting future results our operating results may fluctuate our annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors  including the level and timing of customer orders the composition of the costs of sales between materials and labor and manufacturing overhead price competition our level of experience in manufacturing a particular product the degree of automation used in our assembly process the efficiencies achieved by us in managing inventories and fixed assets fluctuations in materials costs and availability of materials the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to variation in demand for our customers products  our customers inventory management  new product introductions and manufacturing strategy changes  and consolidations among our customers 
in the past  changes in customer orders have had a significant effect on our results of operations due to corresponding changes in the level of overhead absorption 
any one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly results of operations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quarterly results 
we depend on a limited number of customers for the fiscal year ended august   our four largest customers accounted for approximately of our net revenue and approximately customers accounted for over of our net revenue 
for the fiscal year ended august   cisco systems  inc  dell computer corporation  hewlett packard company and lucent technologies accounted for approximately   and of our net revenue  respectively 
we are dependent upon the continued growth  viability and financial stability of our customers whose industries have experienced rapid technological change  short product life cycles  consolidation  and pricing and margin pressures 
we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
we cannot assure you that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
if they do  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  we generate significant account receivables in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers 
if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the manufacturing services provided by us  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business customers and marketing 
the volume and timing of customer sales may vary the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers products our customers attempts to manage their inventory electronic design changes changes in our customers manufacturing strategy acquisitions of or consolidations among customers due in part to these factors  most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter in advance 
our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 
in the past  we have been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our customers 
anticipated orders from many of our customers have  in the past  failed to materialize or delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in our customers business needs  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
on other occasions  our customers have required rapid increases in production  which have placed an excessive burden on our resources 
such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on us in the past  and we may experience such effects in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business backlog 
we are in a highly competitive industry the electronic manufacturing services business is highly competitive 
we compete against numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers  including sci systems  inc  solectron corporation  celestica  inc 
and flextronics international 
in addition  we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronic manufacturers that are selling  or may begin to sell  electronic manufacturing services 
most of our competitors have international operations and some have substantially greater manufacturing  financial  research and development  and marketing resources than us 
we also face potential competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers  who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally versus the advantages of outsourcing 
see business competition 
our rapid growth may be difficult to manage we have grown rapidly 
our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  continue to develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors  and continue to train  motivate and manage our employees 
our failure to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
see selected consolidated financial data and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we may experience risks relating to our computer integration we have completed the installation of an enterprise resource planning system in six of our locations 
we are in the process of installing this system in our remaining plants which will replace the current manufacturing resource planning system and financial information systems 
any delay in the implementation of these new information systems could result in material adverse consequences  including disruption of operations  loss of information and unanticipated increases in cost 
we may encounter difficulties with acquisitions we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations and management of our recent acquisitions 
similarly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate or  if consummated  successfully integrate the operations and management of future acquisitions 
acquisitions involve significant risks  which could have a material adverse effect on us  including financial risks  such as potential liabilities of the acquired businesses  the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the financial impact of amortizing goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any acquisitions that are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and possible adverse tax and accounting effects 
operating risks  such as the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the businesses to be acquired  the risk that the acquired businesses will fail to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided  the need to implement financial and other systems and add management resources  the risk that key employees of the acquired businesses will leave after the acquisition  and unforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations 
the availability of the manufacturing components we need may be limited substantially all of our net revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing in which we provide materials procurement 
while most of our significant long term customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors  we typically bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re pricings or  if such re pricing is not permitted  during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract 
accordingly  certain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins 
almost all of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are available from only a single source 
some of these components are allocated from time to time in response to supply shortages 
in some cases  supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component 
in addition  at various times industry wide shortages of electronic components have occurred  particularly of memory and logic devices 
such circumstances have produced significant levels of short term interruption of our operations  and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business components procurement 
our international operations may be subject to certain risks we derived of our revenues from international operations in fiscal year we currently operate outside the united states in contagem  brazil  dan shui  panyu  and shenzhen  china  sheung shui  hong kong  tiszaujvaros  hungary  dublin  ireland  bergamo  italy  penang  malaysia  chihuahua  guadalajara and tijuana  mexico  and livingston  scotland 
we continually consider additional opportunities to make foreign acquisitions and construct new foreign facilities 
our international operations may be subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political and economic instability unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable export duties  import controls and trade barriers including quotas governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the united states burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could affect local payroll  utility and other expenses inability to utilize net operating losses incurred by our foreign operations to reduce our us income taxes in our experience  entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start up expenses for market development  hiring and establishing office facilities before any significant revenues are generated 
as a result  initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we depend on key personnel our continued success depends largely on the efforts and skills of our key managerial and technical employees 
the loss of the services of certain of these key employees or an inability to attract or retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on us 
we do not have employment agreements or non competition agreements with our key employees 
we must maintain our technological and manufacturing process expertise the market for our manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development 
we are continually evaluating the advantages and feasibility of new manufacturing processes 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and provide manufacturing services which meet our customers changing needs  maintain technological leadership  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
we cannot assure you that our process development efforts will be successful 
see business technology and research and development 
we are subject to a variety of environmental law compliance responsibilities we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process 
if we fail to comply with any present and future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment  or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
certain existing stockholders have significant control our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders and their affiliates collectively beneficially own of our outstanding common stock  of which william d 
morean beneficially owns 
as a result  our executive officers  directors  principal stockholders and their affiliates have significant influence over the election of our board of directors  the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval  and the affairs and policies of jabil 
our stock price may be volatile our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future  based on a variety of factors  including future announcements covering us or our key customers or competitors  government regulations  litigation  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  fluctuations in quarterly operating results  or general conditions in the contract manufacturing  communications  computer peripherals  personal computer  automotive or consumer products industries 
furthermore  stock prices for many companies  and high technology companies in particular  fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results 
those fluctuations and general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions or international currency fluctuations and demand for our services  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law may have certain anti takeover effects the corporation law of the state of delaware and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each contain certain provisions that may  in effect  discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of jabil or unsolicited acquisition proposals from taking place 
we are sensitive to changes in interest rates we pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our million revolving credit facility at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates 
as of august   we did not have outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we also have funding costs associated with the asset backed securitization 
costs are in part based on commercial paper rates 
as of august   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the asset backed securitization
