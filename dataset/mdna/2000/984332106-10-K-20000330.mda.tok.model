year update in order to reduce the risks of the year compliance problem  yahoo established a year team which undertook a formal assessment of the impact of the year problem 
the formal process involved assessment of the following yahoo systems internal infrastructure systems hardware systems  including servers and systems used for date storage  software systems  including applications  development tools and proprietary code  infrastructure systems  including routers  hubs and networks  facility systems  including general building functions  security  hvac and related operations yahoo products  including yahoo s web site and related services  and the systems of yahoo business partners  including content providers and isps 
yahoo conducted its formal assessment of year compliance by gathering information on each aspect of yahoo s internal infrastructure  including all applications and hardware in use by yahoo  reviewing each component or application for date usage  and examining date representations 
yahoo has not experienced any significant year issues associated with its systems 
yahoo focused on identifying and resolving any year issues existing within the yahoo web site and yahoo s related services 
as of march   yahoo was not aware of any significant year issues directly related to a failure of its products to be year ready 
with respect to vendor supplied items and services  yahoo conducted an extensive review of product compliance information on such items and services available online  in vendor literature and through trade group information resources  contacted its vendors for compliance information  and maintained documentation of assessments that have been performed by such vendors or outside sources 
as of march   yahoo has not been negatively affected by the year issue associated with these suppliers 
yahoo did not incur material costs in this formal assessment process  and currently does not believe that the cost of any additional actions will have a material effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
the year is a leap year  and february  is a date frequently associated with the year issue 
in addition  some year issues may not be discovered until well after january  as such  yahoo believes that risks associated with the year issue may continue to exist after january  yahoo believes its most likely worst case scenarios after january  will relate to undiscovered problems associated with its products  due to the inability to anticipate every possible year problem  or due to problems associated with the interaction between yahoo s products and its vendors applications 
a failure in yahoo s products could result in claims against yahoo and could materially and adversely affect yahoo s financial condition and results of operations 
finally  yahoo believes that it has taken steps to identify and address year issues within its various readiness programs 
however  if efforts to identify and address year issues in yahoo s internal infrastructure  product readiness  and vendor base were unsuccessful  including those issues associated with the leap year  yahoo may experience unanticipated problems that could materially and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and change in the market values of its investments 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues from the company s foreign subsidiaries were of total revenues in international sales are made mostly from the company s foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to the company s foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company in was not material 
investment risk 
the company invests in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than and the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations 
for these investments in privately held companies  the company s policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
the company identifies and records impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
to date  no such impairment has been recorded 
since the company s initial investment  certain of these investments in privately held companies have become marketable securities upon the investees completing initial public offerings 
such investments  most of which are in the internet industry  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market  and are recorded as long term investments
