item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general background and performance measurement the company believes that the most significant measures of its operating performance are funds from operations and ebitda 
funds from operations is defined as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales or write down of assets  plus depreciation and amortization excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities 
adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis 
funds from operations does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
ebitda represents earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  minority interest  equity in income loss of unconsolidated entities  extraordinary items  gain loss on sale of assets and preferred dividends 
this data is relevant to an understanding of the economics of the shopping center business as it indicates cash flow available from operations to service debt and satisfy certain fixed obligations 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the company s operating performance  or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
while the performance of individual centers and the management companies determines ebitda  the company s capital structure also influences funds from operations 
the most important component in determining ebitda and funds from operations is center revenues 
center revenues consist primarily of minimum rents  percentage rents and tenant expense recoveries 
minimum rents will increase to the extent that new leases are signed at market rents that are higher than prior rents 
minimum rents will also fluctuate up or down with changes in the occupancy level 
additionally  to the extent that new leases are signed with more favorable expense recovery terms  expense recoveries will increase 
percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant sales 
as leases roll over  however  a portion of historical percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent 
it is therefore common for percentage rents to decrease as minimum rents increase 
accordingly  in discussing financial performance  the company combines minimum and percentage rents in order to better measure revenue growth 
the following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the company for the years ended december   and the following discussion compares the activity for the year ended december  to results of operations for also included is a comparison of the activities for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

denotes the company owned an interest in this center through one of the management companies from the date of acquisition through october  on october   of the membership interests of the entity owning this center were contributed to pacific premier retail trust 
the financial statements include the results of these centers for periods subsequent to their acquisition 
the properties acquired by sdg macerich properties  lp  pacific premier retail trust and the management companies joint venture acquisitions are reflected using the equity method of accounting 
the results of these acquisitions are reflected in the consolidated results of operations of the company in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures and the management companies 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued many of the variations in the results of operations  discussed below  occurred due to the addition of these properties to the portfolio during and many factors impact the company s ability to acquire additional properties  including the availability and cost of capital  the overall debt to market capitalization level  interest rates and availability of potential acquisition targets that meet the company s criteria 
accordingly  management is uncertain whether during the balance of  and in future years  there will be similar acquisitions and corresponding increases in revenues  net income and ffo that occurred as a result of the and acquisition centers 
management anticipates the pace of acquisitions to slow considerably in compared to and pacific view formerly known as buenaventura mall  crossroads mall boulder  huntington center and parklane mall are currently under redevelopment and are referred to herein as the redevelopment centers 
huntington center was sold on november  all other centers  excluding the and acquisition centers and redevelopment centers  are referred to herein as the same centers  unless the context otherwise requires 
the bankruptcy and or closure of an anchor  or its sale to a less desirable retailer  could adversely affect customer traffic in a center and thereby reduce the income generated by that center 
furthermore  the closing of an anchor could  under certain circumstances  allow certain other anchors or other tenants to terminate their leases or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center 
other retail stores at the centers may also seek the protection of bankruptcy laws and or close stores  which could result in the termination of such tenants leases and thus cause a reduction in cash flow generated by the centers 
in addition  the company s success in the highly competitive real estate shopping center business depends upon many other factors  including general economic conditions  the ability of tenants to make rent payments  increases or decreases in operating expenses  occupancy levels  changes in demographics  competition from other centers and forms of retailing and the ability to renew leases or relet space upon the expiration or termination of leases

year compliance program approximately two years ago  the company initiated a year compliance program which consisted of the following phases identification of year issues  assessment of year compliance of systems  remediation or replacement of non compliant systems  testing of critical systems to verify compliance  and contingency planning  as appropriate 
this program included a review of both information technology it and non it systems of the company s offices and the centers in which the company has an ownership interest and manages 
in addition  material tenants  anchors and vendors of the centers were surveyed for year compliance and contingency plans were prepared for each center 
year compliance program results two of the key dates of the company s year program were january  and february  the company encountered no year compliance issues with any operating system  material tenant  anchor and or vendor on either date because the company was able to successfully identify and address the potential year issues in advance 
costs the company was able to minimize costs by using its own personnel to administer the year program 
no outside consultants or third parties were hired except for testing purposes 
the preliminary final costs for the company s year program were approximately  and consisted of the following a it systems one it hardware system needed a year upgrade at a cost of  b non it systems certain critical systems  energy management systems  five telephone systems  two fire alarm systems  one security alarm system  one cctv system  one hvac system and one elevator intercom system required year upgrades 
replacement and or remediation of all non it systems at the centers and offices cost the company approximately  c electrical inspection the electrical infrastructure of each center was inspected to ensure year compliance at an estimated cost of approximately  d testing of critical system all date sensitive critical operating systems at each center and office were tested to ensure year compliance 
in most cases outside vendors tested the system and charged a fee 
the company s total testing costs were approximately e security contingency plans each center implemented security contingency plans 
the aggregate costs of approximately  included the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and obtaining necessary equipment and back up supplies ranging from emergency generators to flashlights 
f personnel the company did not separately record the internal costs incurred for its year compliance program 
such costs are primarily the related payroll costs for its personnel who were part of the year program 
funds from operations the company believes that the most significant measure of its performance is ffo 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit to be net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales or write down of assets  plus depreciation and amortization excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities 
adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations  as defined by gaap  and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
the following reconciles net income available to common stockholders to ffo shares amount shares amount amounts in thousands net income available to common stockholders   adjustments to reconcile net income to ffo basic minority interest   loss on early extinguishment of debt   gain on sale of wholly owned assets  loss on sale or write down of assets from unconsolidated entities pro rata depreciation and amortization on wholly owned centers   depreciation and amortization on joint ventures and from the management companies pro rata   less depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan costs and interest rate caps   ffo basic     additional adjustment to arrive at ffo diluted impact of convertible preferred stock     impact of stock options and restricted stock using the treasury method  impact of convertible debentures   n a anti dilutive ffo diluted     funds from operations  continued calculated based upon basic net income as adjusted to reach basic ffo 
weighted average number of shares includes the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for assuming the conversion of all outstanding op units 
the computation of ffo diluted and diluted average number of shares outstanding includes the effect of outstanding common stock options and restricted stock using the treasury method 
convertible debentures for the twelve month period ending december  were anti dilutive and were not included in the ffo calculation 
the debentures are dilutive at december  and are included in the ffo calculation 
on february   the company sold million of its series a preferred stock 
on june   the company sold million of its series b preferred stock 
the preferred stock can be converted on a one for one basis for common stock 
the preferred shares are assumed converted for purposes of net income as they are dilutive to that calculation 
the preferred shares are anti dilutive to net income for the preferred shares are assumed converted for purposes of ffo diluted per share as they are dilutive to that calculation 
included in minimum rents were rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight lining of rents 
the amount of straight lining of rents that impacted minimum rents was  for   for and  for inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of a relatively low inflation rate 
most of the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term 
these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on increases in the consumer price index 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years  which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
additionally  most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses 
this reduces the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty temporary retailer rents during the holiday season 
as a result of the above  plus the accounting change discussed below for percentage rent  earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter of each year 
new pronouncements issued in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb  through the emerging issues task force eitf  modified the timing of recognition of revenue for percentage rent received from tenants in eitf  accounting for contingent rent in interim financial periods eitf 
the company applied this accounting change as of april  the accounting change had the effect of deferring  including the pro rata share of joint ventures  of percentage rent from the second and third quarters of to the quarter ended december  during the fourth quarter of  the fasb reversed eitf accordingly  the company resumed accounting for percentage rent on the accrual basis for in december  the securities and exchange committee issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements  sab which will be effective for periods beginning after december  this bulletin again modified the timing of revenue recognition for percentage rent received from tenants and adopted the method mandated by eitf the company expects this change to defer recognition of a significant amount of percentage rent for the first three calendar quarters into the fourth quarter 
the company applied this accounting change as of january  estimates of the effects of this change have not yet been determined 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas which requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet  measured at fair value 
changes in the fair values of those derivatives will be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which delays the implementation of sfas from january  to january  the company has not yet determined when it will implement sfas nor has it completed the analysis required to determine the impact on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  reducing interest rate exposure on certain long term variable rate debt through the use of interest rate caps with appropriately matching maturities  using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions  and taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long term debt and or equity 
the following table sets forth information as of december  concerning the company s long term debt obligations  including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value fv for the years ended december  dollars in thousands thereafter total fv long term debt fixed rate         average interest rate fixed rate debentures    average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate total debt wholly owned centers         joint venture centers at company s pro rata share fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate total debt joint ventures         total debt all centers         million of variable debt maturing in represents the outstanding borrowings under the company s credit facility 
the credit facility matures in february in addition  the company has assessed the market risk for its variable rate debt and believes that a increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million per year based on million outstanding at december  the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflects the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration
