the euro the treaty on european union provided that an economic and monetary union emu be established in europe whereby a single european currency  the euro  replaces the currencies of participating member states 
the euro was introduced on january   at which time the value of participating member state currencies was irrevocably fixed against the euro and the european currency unit ecu was replaced at the rate of one euro to one ecu 
for the three year transitional period ending december   the national currencies of member states will continue to circulate  but as sub units of the euro 
new public debt will be issued in euros and existing debt may be redenominated into euros 
at the end of the transitional period  euro banknotes and coins will be issued  and the national currencies of the member states will cease to be legal tender no later than june  the countries that adopted the euro on january  are austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal  and spain 
the company has operations in all of these countries 
as a result of the euro conversion  it is possible that selling prices of the company s products and services will experience downward pressure  as current price variations among countries are reduced due to easy comparability of euro prices across countries 
prices will tend to harmonize  although value added taxes and transportation costs will still justify price differentials 
adoption of the euro will probably accelerate existing market and pricing trends including pan european buying and general price erosion 
on the other hand  currency exchange and hedging costs will be reduced  lower prices and pan european buying will benefit the company in its purchasing endeavors  the number of banks and suppliers needed will be reduced  there will be less variation in payment terms  and it will be easier for the company to expand into new marketing channels such as mail order and internet marketing 
the company is in the process of making changes in areas such as marketing and pricing  purchasing  contracts  payroll  taxes  cash management and treasury operations 
billing systems have been modified so that  in  the company was able to show total gross  value added tax  and net in euros on national currency invoices  to enable customers to pay in the new euro currency if they wish to do so 
countries that have installed erp sap software in connection with the company s enterprise resource planning project are able to invoice and receive payments in euros as well as in other currencies 
systems for pricing  payroll and expense reimbursements will continue to use national currencies until year end the functional currencies of the company s operations in affected countries will remain the national currencies until approximately mid year  when they will change to the euro 
by that time  all affected countries will have converted to the new erp sap software

summary of operating data a summary of operating data for and for the four years prior is shown on page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financing activities  is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and interest rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company manages exposures to changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
see note  financial instruments  for further discussion of the company s policy for managing such exposures 
the majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in euros or in british pounds sterling 
the magnitude and nature of such hedging activities are explained further in note  financial instruments 
if foreign currency exchange rates at december  and increased  the company would incur an million and million loss on foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december  and  respectively 
such losses would be substantially offset by gains from the revaluation or settlement of the underlying positions hedged 
the company has used silver forward contracts to minimize almost all of its exposure to increases in silver prices in and expects to continue to use these instruments to minimize silver price risk in as of december   the company had open forward contracts hedging the majority of its planned silver requirements for the first quarter of based on broker quoted termination values  if the price of silver decreased from and per troy ounce at december  and  respectively  the fair value of silver forward contracts would be reduced by million and million  respectively 
such losses in fair value  if realized  would be offset by lower costs of manufacturing silver containing products 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities and less so through investments in marketable securities 
the company utilizes us dollar denominated commercial paper and borrowings as well as foreign currency denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
the majority of short term and long term borrowings are in fixed rate instruments 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings and marketable securities as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
using a yield to maturity analysis  if december  interest rates increased about basis points with the december  level of debt  there would be decreases in fair value of short term and long term borrowings of million and million  respectively 
if december  interest rates increased about basis points with the december  level of debt  there would be decreases in fair value of short term and long term borrowings of million and million  respectively
