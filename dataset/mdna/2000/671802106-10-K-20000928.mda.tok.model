general the company designs  develops and markets high performance embedded software and integrated semiconductor solutions to original equipment manufacturers worldwide that serve the optical storage and digital imaging markets 
the company s products consist primarily of embedded software  integrated circuits and supporting software and firmware to provide a complete solution for customers  thereby enabling them to deliver cost effective  powerful systems to end users for home and business use 
the company s mission is to be a leading solutions provider for the storage and distribution of digital content 
during fiscal  the company restructured its operations along its two re organized market focused groups the optical storage group and the imaging group 
the imaging group comprises the company s recent acquisition  xionics and its pixel magic subsidiary  serving the digital imaging equipment market 
the company also disbanded its consumer group selling its broadband business during fiscal to conexant 
in its press release regarding the results of operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reported a pro forma net loss of million  its tenth consecutive quarterly pro forma loss 
as presented in the company s press release  pro forma net loss excludes the effects of restructuring charges  amortization of intangibles  acquired in process technology and the effects of a gain on the sale of a business unit during fiscal low revenues and continued losses are primarily due to a product transition in the company s optical storage business  which historically has accounted for approximately of the company s revenues 
volume shipments of its next generation cd rw controllers are currently ramping and are expected to increase as the company s oem customers achieve production volumes 
however  the company cannot predict the product s ultimate level of customer acceptance  product life or the impact of that acceptance or product life on future operating results 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results have been  and will continue to be  affected by a wide variety of factors that could have a material adverse effect on revenues and profitability during any particular period  including competitive pressures on selling prices  availability and cost of foundry capacity and raw materials  fluctuations in yield  loss of any strategic relationships  the company s ability to introduce new products in accordance with oem design requirements and design cycles  new product introductions by the company s competitors and market acceptance of product sold by both the company and its customers 
to date  oak has not item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued experienced any material delays in its wafer deliveries from its primary manufacturers 
however  with the current shortage of foundry capacity  which is expected to continue throughout calendar  there can be no assurance that delays will not occur in the future 
in addition  the company s operating results are subject to fluctuations in the markets for its customers products  particularly the consumer electronics and personal computer markets  which have been extremely volatile in the past 
the company has devoted a substantial portion of its research and development efforts in recent quarters to developing chips used in dvd systems  cd rw drivers and inkjet multi function peripherals 
the company s dvd  cd rw  and digital imaging products are subject to the new product risks described in the preceding paragraph  including in particular the company s ability to timely introduce these products and the market s acceptance of them  which could have a materially adverse effect on its operating results results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net revenues  certain consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated june  revenues product revenues software and other revenues total revenues cost of revenues cost of product revenues cost of software and other revenues total cost of revenues product gross margin software and other gross margin total gross margin research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles restructuring charge acquired in process research and development operating loss gain on sale of business unit non operating income  net loss income before income taxes income taxes benefit expense net loss income note product and software  service and other costs of revenues and gross margins are expressed as a percentage of product or software  service and other revenues  respectively 
all other line items are expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal year the million absolute increase in revenues is comprised principally by a million increase in imaging revenues offset by a decline in optical storage revenues of million 
the imaging revenue item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued increase was attributable to both the inclusion of post acquisition software revenues from business operations acquired from xionics from january   the date the acquisition was completed  as well as a substantial year over year increase in the revenues from sales of integrated semiconductors for the digital imaging market 
the decline in the optical storage segment revenues is the result of a continuing decline during the first six months of fiscal in unit sales and average selling price asp of cd rom controllers in the optical storage business segment compared to fiscal the decline was due to a continuing loss of cd rom market share  the maturation of the cd rom market and development delays in the company s next generation products 
this trend was offset in the second half of fiscal by a strong increase in optical storage revenues from the introduction of a new cd rw product 
in the second half of fiscal  optical storage revenues increased dramatically from million in the first six months  to million for the second six months of fiscal this increase was directly attributable to the company s newly introduced oti x cd rw controller 
overall for the year  the increase in imaging revenues and the success of the oti in the second half of fiscal resulted in revenues reflecting a steady to slightly increasing year over year growth rate based on the historical pro forma measurement of revenue as outlined in footnote to the financial statements 
for fiscal years  and  sales to the company s top ten customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
two customers accounted for over of revenues in fiscal lg electronics and hewlett packard 
lg electronics represents of the optical storage segment revenues and hewlett packard represents of the imaging segment revenues 
in fiscal yamaha corporation accounted for and mitsumi electronic co 
accounted for 
in fiscal there were three customers in excess of mitsumi electronics  lg electronics and nec home electronics 
international sales  principally to japan and korea amounted to approximately  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
gross margin 
product cost of revenues includes the cost of wafer fabrication  assembly and testing performed by third party vendors and direct and indirect costs associated with the procurement  scheduling and quality assurance functions performed by the company 
software and other cost of revenues consist of the costs of software documentation as well as royalties that may be due to third parties and labor associated with other smaller streams of revenue associated with nonrecurring engineering services and oem maintenance and support 
gross margins improved to in fiscal from in fiscal these increases were primarily due to the higher volume of imaging products with higher average gross margins in the second half of fiscal as a result of the acquisition of xionics 
in addition  the company experienced a shift in semiconductor product mix with relatively more semiconductor coming from imaging and less from older optical storage products with declining asp s 
this is what gives rise to the improvement in product gross margins from in fiscal to in fiscal gross margins for the optical storage segment was for fiscal as compared to in fiscal this increase is primarily due to a shift in product mix from predominantly older generation products with declining asp s to newer products with higher gross margins 
gross margin for the imaging business segment was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal this was due to a shift in semiconductor product mix and an expected level of price degradation on older semiconductor imaging products offset by the inclusion of higher margin xionics software and other revenue halfway through the year 
the company s overall gross margin is subject to change due to various factors  including  among others  competitive product pricing  yields  wafer costs  assembly and test costs and product mix 
the company expects that asps for its existing products will decline over time and that asps for each new product will decline significantly over the life of the product 
in addition  given the extremely competitive nature of the optical storage market  the company believes that gross margins for new products in its optical storage market may be lower than historical levels and that  as a result  gross margins in general may decline in the future 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued research and development expenses 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million and million  and expressed as a percentage of net revenues were and in fiscal and  respectively 
the absolute dollar increase in research and development spending for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of xionics product development expenses in the second half of the fiscal year  as offset somewhat by the divestiture and sale of the broadband business unit to conexant which closed on january  the increase in development spending as a percentage of revenues in fiscal was largely due to the decline in the company s revenue base  a trend that began to reverse in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline is largely due to non recurring consulting expenses of million and other litigation expenses incurred in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses due to a streamlining of the historical sg a cost structure necessitated by the continued decline in optical storage revenues in the first six months of fiscal was largely offset by increases caused by the acquisition of xionics 
amortization of intangibles and acquired in process research and development 
acquisition related charges include primarily the costs associated with the acquisition of xionics as well as certain other smaller acquisitions in fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal the company completed the acquisition of xionics and charged million to operations for in process research and development ipr d 
additionally  million of the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets and is being amortized to operations on a straight line basis over the next five years 
approximately million of the million of intangible asset amortization recognized during fiscal was related to the xionics acquisition 
on january   the shareholders of both the company and xionics document technologies  inc xionics approved a definitive acquisition agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  oak issued approximately million shares of its common stock and approximately million in cash to acquire all of the common stock of xionics 
the transaction has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the company recorded a special charge of approximately million against earnings in the third fiscal quarter of in order to write off the cost of in process research and development acquired in the merger 
in addition to the million charge taken  approximately million representing the fair value of net intangible assets acquired in the merger has been recorded as intangible assets on the company s balance sheet and amortized over three to five years 
at the acquisition date  xionics had several in process research and development projects in each of its product groups languages  drivers  mfp s and its new complementary product for a tandem copy print engine 
in each product group there were projects that had not yet achieved technological feasibility 
as image processing represents a very specialized market  it is unlikely that xionics in process technology could be successfully deployed in alternative market applications 
further  it was determined that there was significant technological risk and substantial development expenses relating to each of the products under development 
as a result  the company took a million charge against earnings in fiscal in order to reflect an allocation of the purchase price associated with the value of the in process research and development which  due to it s uncertain future value at the date of acquisition  could not be considered an investment in an asset 
the valuation of the acquired in process research and development used by the company in making the determination as to the amount of in process research and development expense was supported by valuation studies 
the estimated value of in process research and development was derived using the income approach  which values an asset based on future cash flows that could potentially be generated by the asset over its estimated useful life 
the future cash flows were discounted to their present value utilizing a discount rate of 
the amounts of the purchase price technology assigned to the fair values of in process research and development and purchased technology represent management s best estimate 
the company did not anticipate any material changes from historical pricing  margins and expense levels used in its valuation assumptions 
restructuring charge 
during the third quarter of fiscal the company accrued million as restructuring charges primarily related to the abandonment of its leased facility in andover  massachusetts 
the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued leased facility had months remaining  however the company had negotiated a lease buyout 
these costs will be paid in fiscal non operating income 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company sold its broadband business unit located in the united kingdom for million in cash and stock and recorded a non operating gain of million related to the sale 
interest income at million is higher than the million earned in fiscal due primarily to higher interest rates available in the market during fiscal the company also experienced a net loss of million on its equity method investments 
this was the result of several factors including a bankruptcy by one of its older investees and a permanent impairment reserve against another investment 
these losses were offset by a million gain on the sale of an investment in wavemark  which the company had indirectly acquired through the acquisition of xionics 
the investment was valued at fair market value on the date of acquisition 
subsequent to the acquisition  significant economic events occurred that resulted in an increase in the fair value of the investment 
the investment was sold prior to year end  with the company recording a gain of million 
income taxes 
management believes that sufficient future taxable income may not be generated in order to realize all the company s deferred tax assets 
accordingly  during fiscal a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was established 
given this  no income tax benefit was recognized with respect to operating losses for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal approximately two thirds of the revenue decrease was attributable to a decrease in unit sales of cd rom controllers in the optical storage business segment compared to fiscal  with the remainder of the decrease due to a decline in the average selling price asp of the cd rom controllers 
the decrease in unit sales was due to a loss of cd rom and cd rw market share  the maturation of the cd rom market  development delays in the company s next generation cd rom and cd rw products  and to a lesser extent  economic downturns in the asian markets to which a large majority of the company s products are sold 
overall  sales of optical storage products  which accounted for of the company s revenues in the prior fiscal year  declined in fiscal year revenues for the digital imaging equipment business segment were million for fiscal  representing a increase over the million reported in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increase revenues from the segment s resolution enhancement products 
net revenues for the consumer business segment were million for fiscal  representing a decrease from the million reported in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to decreased revenues from the segment s vcd decoder products 
for fiscal and  sales to the company s top ten customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
two customers accounted for over of revenues in fiscal  compared to three customers in fiscal international sales  principally to japan  korea  singapore  and belgium accounted for approximately and of the company s net revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
included in net revenues for fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively  of nonrefundable technology license fees and royalties 
gross margin 
cost of revenues includes the cost of wafer fabrication  assembly and testing performed by third party vendors and direct and indirect costs associated with the procurement  scheduling and quality assurance functions performed by the company 
software and other cost of revenues consist of the costs of royalties that may be due to third parties and labor associated with other smaller streams of revenue associated with nonrecurring engineering services and oem maintenance and support 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s gross margin decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin is primarily the result of a decrease in asps for the company s cd rom controller products in the optical storage business segment  which was only partially offset by a decrease in the company s unit cost for the same products and an increase of higher margin royalty revenues 
additionally  fixed cost based operations costs included in cost of goods sold  which were relatively flat on a dollar basis  became higher as a percentage of revenues due to the significant decline in sales volumes 
gross margins for the digital imaging equipment business segment were for fiscal  representing a decrease from gross margin reported in fiscal gross margins for the consumer business segment were for fiscal  representing a slight increase from gross margin reported in fiscal gross margin in fiscal includes a million provision for potential forfeiture of certain foundry deposits with chartered semiconductor 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
gross margin in fiscal included the impact of a charge to cost of revenues related to increases in inventory reserves of million recorded during the year as well as a million charge related to the discontinuation of the graphics and audio communications businesses 
excluding the impact of these inventory and foundry related charges  gross margin would have been in fiscal and in fiscal the company recorded inventory reserves of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the reserves represented write downs of excess and obsolete products  primarily servo chipsets for the videocd market in asia 
these write downs were the result of management s assessment that the market for these products had either significantly declined or no longer exists 
research and development expenses 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million and million  and expressed as a percentage of net revenues were and in fiscal and  respectively 
the absolute dollar increase in research and development spending for fiscal compared to was primarily due to the hiring of additional technical personnel 
research and development expenses increased significantly as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal this increase was due to the significant decrease in the company s net revenues compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
s  g a expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  the company incurred approximately million of consulting fees and other expenses related to the evaluation of a buyout proposal from gold acquisition group 
additionally  legal expenses related to the complaint the company filed with the international trade commission itc on april  and additional litigation were higher in fiscal year compared to fiscal year see legal proceedings 
the increase in s  g a expenses from fiscal to was also due to the hiring of additional management and administrative personnel since the prior year periods  and associated expenses 
s  g a expenses increased significantly as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to the significant decrease in the company s net revenues 
amortization of intangibles and acquired in process research and development 
acquisition related charges include the costs associated with the acquisitions of viewpoint and xli in fiscal and the acquisition of certain assets of odeum in fiscal these costs also include amortization of intangibles  in this case purchased technology related to the odeum  viewpoint and xli acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of fiscal and first quarter of fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
viewpoint technology in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired viewpoint  a privately held development stage company focused on developing high performance solutions for the growing compact disc read write market  specifically a controller device to support high encoding speeds for next generation cd rw drives  which was its only technology 
at the date of acquisition  viewpoint had yet to introduce its first product in the market place and was in the process of developing its vpt product  but still required key firmware  drivers  design changes and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued silicon testing prior to achieving technological feasibility 
viewpoint s technology was only valuable when integrated into the company server technology and physically redesigned to add significant key features 
based on discussions with viewpoint technical personnel  it was determined that there were no alternative uses for their cd rw technology and that approximately million in additional engineering and development expenses would be required to bring a product to market in fiscal year the viewpoint technology has enabled the company to develop a cd rw controller product  the  which will support up to x read and x write speeds 
management believes that this product could provide in excess of of the company s revenues in fy the company has commenced development of derivative products incorporating viewpoint s base technology 
the company paid million in cash for all the outstanding shares of viewpoint 
the purchase method of accounting was used to record the acquisition and approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development  which was charged to operations in the quarter ended september  the remaining costs of the acquisition were recorded on the company s balance sheet 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to purchased technology and other intangible assets and is being amortized to operations on a straight line basis over three years  and million was allocated to cash  fixed assets and other tangible assets 
the valuation of the acquired in process research and development used by the company in making the determination as to the amount of in process research and development expense was supported by valuation studies 
the estimated value of in process research and development was derived using the income approach  which values an asset based on future cash flows that could potentially be generated by the asset over its estimated useful life

the company did not anticipate any material changes from historical pricing  margins and expense levels in its valuation assumptions 
xli during the first quarter of fiscal  the company acquired xerographic laser images corporation xli  a provider of print quality enhancement technology for the digital office equipment market 
at the date of acquisition  xli had developed one product  the xli image enhancer  and was also in the process of developing other high performance products for digital copiers  multi function devices  scanners and display markets 
the company acquired xli in order to gain access to imaging technology and expertise that would complement its own image process solutions 
xli had a number of products in the development stage  none of which had reached the level of prototype or working sample 
three primary projects in process at the date of acquisition were the cp which enables printers to have more precise dot positioning and modulation and thereby  more accurately apply the color on the paper  the p  a black and white printer enhancement chip  and a family of products for the emerging flat panel display market 
based on discussions with xli s technical personnel  it was determined that there were no alternative uses for their specific technologies outside of the digital office market and that approximately million in additional engineering and development expenses would be required to bring in process products to market beginning in fiscal year the company expected that about of its future revenues could be derived from products integrating xli s technologies 
however  subsequent to the acquisition the company has experienced some development delays and has adjusted future estimates accordingly 
the company s management does not believe that failure to complete in process products will have a material adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company paid million in cash for all the outstanding shares of xli 
the purchase method of accounting was used to record the acquisition and approximately million was allocated to in process research and development  which was charged to operations in the quarter ended september  the remaining costs of the acquisition were recorded on the company s balance sheet and are being amortized to operations on a straight line basis over three years 
in addition to the purchase price  xli shareholders have the right to receive additional payments subject to the achievement of certain milestones by xli 
under the terms of the merger agreement  revenue levels from products utilizing xli s technologies in excess of a base amount of million each year of a three year period item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued ending december  must be attained for xli to receive additional contingency payments  up to the maximum amount of million 
to date  these milestones have not been achieved and no additional payments have been made to xli shareholders 
such payments would be recorded on the company s balance sheet as an adjustment to the purchase price of xli

the company did not anticipate any material changes from historical pricing  margins and expense levels in its valuation assumptions 
odeum in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired certain assets of odeum microsystems  inc odeum  a subsidiary of hyundai electronics america 
with the acquisition  the company acquired an integrated mpeg audio video decoder and transport demultiplexor and a dvb s compliant qspk demodulator as well as a core group of hardware and software engineers 
the products acquired from odeum are used predominantly in free to air satellite and cable set top boxes for mpeg encoded digital television broadcasting and therefore  represented the company s first step in expanding its consumer business segment and serving the digital television market 
the company has recently introduced its first products into the set top broadcast market incorporating odeum s technologies 
based on discussions with odeum s technical personnel  it was determined that there were no alternative uses for their specific technologies outside the digital broadcast market and that approximately million in additional engineering and development expenses would be required to bring in process products to market beginning in fiscal year the company expected that approximately of its future revenues could be derived from products integrating odeum s technologies 
the assets of odeum were acquired for million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the product acquired was integrated into the company s product offerings from the date of acquisition 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development with the remaining amount was allocated to purchased technology

restructuring charges 
during  the company discontinued its graphics and audio communications businesses and incurred a charge to operations of approximately million related to these discontinued businesses 
the million charge consisted of million related to a write off of prepaid royalties  approximately million for severance pay and million for miscellaneous charges 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
non operating income 
for fiscal  non operating income  net  consisted primarily of net interest income of million 
for fiscal  non operating income  net  included net interest income of million  net foreign currency exchange losses of million and approximately million related to the settlement agreement between the company and united microelectronics corporation in connection with a complaint the company filed with the itc on july  the decrease in net interest income was due primarily to a reduction in the company s invested cash balance for most of fiscal prior to the receipt of the proceeds of the sale of the uicc investment discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded a small net foreign currency exchange gain in fiscal  due to strengthening of the japanese yen as compared to the exchange loss in fiscal item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income taxes 
the effective tax benefit rate for fiscal was 
the benefit rate was significantly less than statutory rates due to limitations on net operating loss carryback benefits available to the company  as well as an increase to the valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax asset 
the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal  which was lower than statutory rates as a result of research and development credits earned by the company becoming a higher percentage of the company s lower taxable income

recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which will be effective for the company s fiscal year sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the company has assessed the impact of this new statement and does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab a and b  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies 
the company is currently assessing the impact of this new staff accounting bulletin on its consolidated financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

fin clarifies certain elements of apb opinion no 
among other issues  this interpretation clarifies the definition of employee for purposes of applying apb opinion no 
 the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as non compensatory  the accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option award  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation in a business combination 
this interpretation is effective for the company in fiscal the company does not believe that the adoption of this interpretation will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its cash requirements from cash generated from operations  the sale of equity securities  bank lines of credit and long term and short term debt 
the company s principal sources of liquidity as of june  consisted of approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company also has approximately million in lines of letters of credit with taiwanese financial institutions  all of which were available at june  the company had outstanding commitments to purchase capital equipment of approximately million at june  additionally  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock during the first four months of fiscal  for a total of approximately million 
the company s working capital decreased by million to million as of june  from million as of june  the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and foundry deposits of million  and increases in accounts payable of million  accrued expenses of million and deferred revenue of million which were partially offset by increases in inventories of million and accounts receivable of million 
the company s short term investments were principally invested in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s cash flows used in operating activities increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily as a result of increased inventories and accounts receivable  partially offset by a decrease in net loss in fiscal the company s cash flows used in operating activities in fiscal were primarily attributable to a net loss of million after adding back non cash activities  and an million increase in inventories  combined with a million increase in accounts receivable which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and a million decrease in foundry deposits 
the company has invested in building inventory and allowed for the growth in receivables and expects to continue to do due to the increasing volume of business driven by new products  particularly in optical storage 
the company s investing activities during fiscal used cash of million as compared to million of cash used for investing activities during fiscal cash used in investing activities during fiscal resulted primarily from the purchase of xionics for million  net of cash acquired  million in additions to property and equipment  and million for the purchase of other equity investments which were partially offset by net proceeds from matured short term investments of million and million in proceeds from the sale of a business unit 
the acquisition of xionics also involved the non cash elements of issuing million in common stock and assuming outstanding stock options valued at million 
proceeds from the sale of a business unit also included the non cash element of  shares of common stock in conexant systems  inc valued at million at the date of divestiture 
this amount is reflected in short term investments on the balance sheet  which also includes a non cash valuation reserve of million  the offset of which is included in the equity section of the balance sheet 
the company s financing activities during fiscal provided cash of approximately million as compared to cash used of million during fiscal cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was the result of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan activity  which was partially offset by million in the acquisition of treasury stock 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company allocated million that is earmarked for venture investments 
the company did not establish a separate legal fund or raise money independent of company funds for these purposes 
the primary purpose of the fund is to invest in companies with developing technologies that leverage the company s core optical storage and imaging businesses 
the company intends to make investments that are focused on technologies that will bring together audio  video  and data content for computing and consumer electronics applications and consumer internet appliances 
the company may also make investments outside of these focused areas 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and credit facilities will be sufficient to provide adequate working capital and to fund operations over the next twelve months 
if  however  during the next twelve to eighteen month period the company fails to increase its revenue or is unable to reduce its expenses below its revenues  then the company may be in a position where it will need to seek additional financing 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek other financing sooner or that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
the company may also utilize cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  the company evaluates potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
however  the company has no present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisition of other businesses  products or technologies  other than those disclosed above or elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
factors that may affect future results the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business 
expected benefits of the merger with xionics may not be achieved 
in order to realize the benefits of the merger  the company will have to effectively integrate the operations and management acquired in the merger  together with technical research and development  sales and marketing  business development efforts and also retain key personnel in this process 
the successful execution of these events will involve considerable risk and may not be item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued successful 
if the company is not successful in accomplishing this integration  then the objectives of the merger  including improved operating results will not be realized 
a key benefit of the merger is perceived to be the company s opportunity to transition from being an integrated circuits provider to a complete solutions provider for the growing digital office market  and thereby  gain a larger share of the products outsourced by the company s original equipment manufacturer  or oem  customers 
the company believes that it will have the resources and technology necessary to be a leading supplier to the digital office market and will offer one of this industry s most integrated and flexible platforms 
however  if the integration is not successful or is unexpectedly delayed or more expensive than contemplated  the company will not realize these benefits to the fullest extent possible 
if the benefits of the merger to company stockholders do not exceed the costs associated with the merger  which costs include integration costs and the dilution to the company s stockholders resulting from the issuance of shares in connection with the merger  then the financial results of the company  including earnings per share  could be adversely affected 
the market price of the company s common stock could decline as a result of the merger if o the integration is unsuccessful or proves to be more expensive or time consuming than expected  o the company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by third party and other financial analysts  or o the effect of the merger on the company s financial results are not consistent with the expectations of third party and other financial analysts 
the company s future financial results will be adversely impacted by the costs of the merger with xionics and may be further adversely impacted by the accounting treatment of the merger 
the company took a charge of approximately million against earnings in the third fiscal quarter of in order to write off the cost of in process research and development acquired in the merger 
the securities and exchange commission scrutinizes large in process research and development write offs 
in addition to the million charge taken  approximately million representing the fair value of net intangible assets acquired in the merger has been recorded on the company s balance sheet and is being amortized over three to five years 
the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant period to period fluctuations in its revenues and operating results  which may result in volatility in the price of its stock 
the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
accordingly  you should not rely on period to period comparisons as an indication of future performance 
in addition  these variations may cause the company s stock price to fluctuate 
if quarterly results fail to meet public expectations  the price of the company s stock may decline 
the company s revenues and operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors  including factors that generally affect everyone in its industry and factors that are more specific to its business and product lines 
the principal risk the company faces in its business and one which has had  and is expected to continue to have  a significant effect on its revenues and operating results  is its dependence on the optical storage market 
other factors specific to its business and product lines include the following o the company s ability to diversify its product offerings and the markets for its products  o the current market for its products  o the loss or gain of important customers  o the timing of significant orders and order cancellations or reschedulings  o pricing policy changes by the company and its competitors and suppliers  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued o the potential for significant inventory exposure  o the timing of the development and introduction of new products or enhanced versions of existing products  o market acceptance of new products  o increased competition in product lines  o barriers to entry into new product lines  o the competitiveness of the company s customers  and o the inability to obtain foundry capacity 
the company is in the process of diversifying its business so that its product offerings include not only integrated circuits  but also embedded software and platform solutions 
however  a significant portion of the company s revenue will continue to come from its semiconductor product offerings 
the semiconductor industry historically has been characterized by rapid technological change and product obsolescence  cyclical market patterns and seasonal customer demand  significant price erosion  periods of over capacity and under capacity  periods of production shortages  variations in manufacturing costs  including raw materials  and yields  and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
in addition  the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of product prices 
any downturns in the industry may cause the company s business  financial condition and results of operations to suffer 
the company has experienced in the past and may in the future experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to these general semiconductor industry conditions 
the downturns in the industry often occur in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both the semiconductor companies and their customers and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production over capacity and subsequent accelerated erosion of average selling prices  and in some cases have lasted for more than a year 
even if customers aggregate demand were not to decline  the availability of additional capacity can adversely impact pricing levels  which can also depress revenue levels 
in addition  the company s quarterly operating results could be materially adversely affected by legal expenses incurred in connection with  or any judgment or settlement in  the company s ongoing stockholder legal proceedings 
see the company is a defendant in several lawsuits 
the company has a recent history of operating losses and may not become or remain profitable 
although the company experienced periods of profitability following its reincorporation in delaware in october in connection with its initial public offering the company was first incorporated in california in  the company has at times sustained significant losses since the initial public offering and may not become profitable in the future 
while the company had net income of million in fiscal  its current loss trend began in calendar year  resulting in an operating loss of million for fiscal  an operating loss of million for fiscal  and an operating loss of million for fiscal in each case before adjustments for non operating income or loss  or income tax expense or benefit 
the company s operating losses generally have been due to its dependence on its optical storage business  which historically has accounted for approximately of its business 
in fiscal  the company failed to timely and or adequately develop its integrated cd rom controller product and second generation cd rw product 
consequently  for fiscal  the company was dependent on mature cd rom products and its first generation cd rw product for its revenue 
these mature products continued to decline in both unit sales volume and average sales price in each successive quarter 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company achieved volume production with its next generation cd rw product 
however  given certain evolving dynamics in the cd rw market  including the rate of adoption of this technology  competition and selling prices  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company cannot accurately predict the product s impact on operating results nor can any assurance be given that revenue from this product will enable the company to return to profitability 
the company expects that the asp s for its optical storage products will continue to decline over time and that asps for each new optical storage product will decline significantly over the life of the product 
in addition  given the extremely competitive nature of the optical storage market  the company believes that gross margins for new products in its optical storage market will be lower than historical levels 
however  the company believes that with the additional planned software and solution product offerings from the company s optical and imaging groups  gross margins in general will increase in the future 
if the company incurs additional losses or fails to achieve profitability in the future  this will significantly harm its business and may affect the trading price of its common stock 
the company s financial performance is highly dependent on the timely and successful introduction of new products 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by evolving industry standards  rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
the company s financial performance is highly dependent upon timely and successful execution of next generation and new products  including those from acquired businesses  particularly in light of the company s past failure to timely develop new products for the optical storage market in fiscal and the failure to timely and successfully introduce next generation and new products that achieve market acceptance in the future could seriously damage the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  the company s performance is highly dependent upon the successful development and timely introduction of its next generation cd rw controller  combination dvd and cd rw controller  mpeg decoder for the dvd player market  and embedded imaging processing solutions for the digital office market  in particular  embedded digital color copier technology and image processing chips for multifunction peripherals 
in the optical storage market  particularly dvd  a variety of standards and formats are being proposed  making it difficult to develop product to market requirements  and making it even more difficult for the market to develop 
product delay s in the company s optical storage group have resulted primarily from difficulties in allocating engineering personnel among competing projects  engineering resource limitations  and unanticipated engineering complexity 
although recently  the company timely introduced its next generation cd rw product and refocused its optical storage group on a defined product roadmap  there can be no assurance that these or other factors will not contribute to future delays 
in the digital office market in which the company s recent acquired business competed with software products and the company with integrated circuits  the company will need to address a variety of other factors related to that market with respect to new product development 
product delays in the past in both the company s imaging group and its recently acquired business have resulted from numerous factors such as changing oem customer product specifications  difficulties in allocating engineering personnel among competing projects  other resource limitations  difficulties with independent contractors  changing market or competitive requirements and unanticipated engineering complexity 
there can be no assurance that these or other factors will not contribute to future delays  that oem customers will tolerate those delays  or that delayed office devices  once introduced  will meet with market acceptance or success 
among other technological changes  embedded pdf and color capability are rapidly emerging as market requirements for printers and other imaging devices 
some of the company s competitors have the capacity to supply these solutions  and some of their solutions are well received in the marketplace 
the company faces the challenges of developing products that will require greater color and image complexity capability including web based documents  and to work with higher performing devices in networked environments 
any significant inability to meet these challenges with the development of products that can effectively compete in the oem software and solutions market could cause future results of operations to differ materially from current expectations 
due to the design complexity of the company s products  especially with the increased levels of integration that are required  the company has previously experienced delays in completing development and introduction of new products for the optical storage and the digital office markets 
in addition  in light of the short product life cycles associated in the markets related to acquired businesses  any delay or unanticipated difficulty associated with new product development or introduction could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued no assurance can be given that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or that its products will be selected for design into the products of its targeted customers 
also  there can be no assurance that the products of the company s customers will be successfully introduced into the market 
if the company fails in its new product development efforts or its products fail to achieve market acceptance  its revenues will decline and its business  financial condition and results of operations will be severely damaged 
the company s future revenues are highly dependent on sales of its cd rw controller product 
the company s future revenue generation is highly dependent on its recently introduced and next generation cd rw product as well as its combination dvd and cd rw product 
the company is no longer developing any cd rom controllers  but since the early part of fiscal has been instead focusing its development efforts on controllers for cd rw and dvd drives 
if the company s recently introduced cd rw product fails to achieve market acceptance  it will need other sources of revenue to offset the previous discontinuation of sales of its cd rom controllers 
in fiscal  revenue generated from the company s optical storage cd rom business declined primarily due to the lack of a next generation integrated cd rom device and revenue generated from the company s optical storage cd rw business increased by  compared to the previous year  primarily due to the introduction of a new cd rw product 
in fiscal  revenue generated from the company s optical storage cd rom and cd r rw businesses declined and  respectively  compared to the previous year  primarily due to delays in the development of the next generation integrated cd rom device and cd rw product 
although the company was a leading supplier of cd rw controllers  due to product delays in its second generation cd rw product  the company lost its leadership in this market 
while the company is currently in production with its next generation cd rw product with a few customers  no assurance can be given this product or its successor will be competitive in the marketplace or carried into production by targeted customers 
in addition  even if this product proves to be competitive and is accepted by targeted customers  there is no assurance that the company s customers will be successful 
the company also faces increased competition in the emerging cd rw and dvd markets in both the pc and consumer segments 
in addition  the current trend toward integrating increased functionality on the cd rw or dvd controller potentially adds to the development and manufacturing costs of producing the controller 
the company s revenues and gross margins from its optical storage controller products will be dependent on the company s ability to introduce integrated products for the cd rw and dvd markets in a commercially competitive manner 
the decrease in the overall level of sales of  and prices for  the company s cd rom and older generation cd rw controller product due to introductions of newer products by competitors  the decline in demand for cd rom controller products generally  product obsolescence and delays in the company s integrated cd rom controller product and its next generation cd rw product  have had a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  and will continue to have that effect if the company fails to successfully introduce new and next generation products to the optical storage market 
the company also anticipates that the royalty streams derived from oems shipments of office equipment containing the company s products  and the sale of related products and services to manufacturers of office equipment will account for a significant portion of its revenue for the foreseeable future  although not as significant as cd rw for the remainder of fiscal and possibly fiscal in order to assure that the company will derive future royalty streams from the shipment of oem devices  the company and its oems are required to develop and release in a regular and timely manner new office products with increased speed  enhanced output resolutions  reduced memory requirements  multiple functions  and network connectivity 
the company s oems are under tremendous pressure to continually shorten the development cycles of these products  leading to increased complexity and cost of development to the company and its oems 
the company s success will depend on  among other things the rate at which oems serving the digital office market outsource their technology needs  market acceptance of the company s technology and products and the office devices of the company s oems  the ability of the company and its oems to meet industry changes and market demands in a timely manner  achievement of new design wins by the company  successful implementation of the company s technology and products in new office devices being developed by its oems  and successful marketing of those devices by the oems 
revenues from the office equipment market will depend heavily on the company s ability to integrate its recent acquired business  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued xionics document technologies  successfully in order to develop complete product solutions and compete more effectively and successfully against other suppliers and outsourcers as well as its own oem customers and other manufacturers 
the company s future revenues related to its imaging group are highly dependent on its relationship with hewlett packard 
historically  contracts and licenses with hewlett packard generated a significant portion in fiscal of the revenues related to the digital office equipment business of xionics document technologies  the company acquired in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  the company s imaging group has sold integrated circuits to hewlett packard in the past 
for fiscal  sales of integrated circuits to hewlett packard represented of oak s imaging revenue 
it is anticipated that revenue from hewlett packard will constitute a significant portion of the company s overall revenues going forward 
therefore  any significant disruption or deterioration of its relationship with hewlett packard would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has met all of its obligations necessary to secure the right to receive ongoing payments from hewlett packard various agreements with hewlett packard  and is also current in performing its obligations under these various agreements 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to meet all such obligations in the future 
hewlett packard has the right to terminate each of its agreements with the company if the company materially breaches its obligations under that agreement and does not cure such breach within days 
in addition  competitors of the company  including without limitation adobe systems inc  peerless systems corporation  electronics for imaging  inc and texas instruments are continuously engaged in efforts to expand their business relationship with hewlett packard at the company s expense  and are likely to continue those efforts in the future 
there can be no assurance that one or more of the company s competitors will not be successful in competing with the company for some or all of hewlett packard s business 
further  although hewlett packard has shown a strong tendency to outsource embedded systems software and development for its office products over the past several years  there can be no assurance that this trend will continue or that hewlett packard s internal development groups will not compete successfully for some or all of this outsourced business in the future 
finally  any adverse change in hewlett packard s business  results of operations or financial condition could in turn have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s markets are intensely competitive and experience rapid technological change 
the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining average unit sales prices and rapid product obsolescence 
if the company cannot successfully respond to the technological advances of others or if its new products or product enhancements do not achieve market acceptance  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed 
the company expects competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter the company s existing or future markets with solutions that may be less costly or provide higher performance or additional features 
the company s principal competitors in the optical storage market are mediatek  toshiba and ricoh  its principal competitors in the digital office market are adobe systems  inc  peerless systems corporation  electronics for imaging  inc  and in house  captive suppliers  and the company expects increased competition from the merchant market in the future 
many of these existing competitors as well as those customers expected to compete in the future have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than the company 
in addition  much of the companies success is dependent on the success of its oem customers 
the company s oem customers in both the optical storage  and digital office markets compete fiercely with one another for market share in a market characterized by rapid development cycles  short product life cycles and ever increasing consumer demand for greater performance and functionality at reduced prices 
the markets for most of the applications for the company s products  especially in the optical storage market  are characterized by intense price competition 
as the markets for these products mature and competition increases  as has been the trend for the optical storage  the company anticipates that average sales prices on products will decline 
if the company is unable to reduce costs sufficiently to offset declines in average sales prices or is unable to successfully introduce new higher performance products with higher average sales prices  operating results will be materially adversely affected 
the future growth of the digital office market is highly dependent on oems continuing to outsource an increasing portion of their product development work 
while the trend toward outsourcing on the part of the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued company s oem customers has accelerated in recent years  any reversal of this trend could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
similarly  significant market trends leading to changes in the way the company s competitors do business may enable them to compete more effectively against the company than they have in the past 
for example  in response to market demand  adobe systems  inc has recently begun licensing the source code of its postscript page description language interpreters to certain development partners  including competitors of the company 
these changes  if they enable competitors to compete more effectively for business from the company s customers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  changes in strategy by the company s competitors  for example price reductions  new product introductions or new marketing distribution methods  could make it more difficult for the company to compete effectively  cause reduced market demand for the company s products and or render the company s products obsolete 
there can be no assurance that the company or its oem customers will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  or that competitive pressures faced by it and its customers will not result in reduced revenues and profit margins and otherwise seriously harm its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may be unable to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights  which may affect its ability to compete 
the company s ability to compete is affected by its ability to protect its proprietary information 
the company considers its technology to be proprietary and relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property rights 
however  these measures afford only limited protection 
the company s competitors may be able to effectively design around the company s patents 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted under those patents will provide competitive advantages to the company 
moreover  while the company holds or has applied for patents relating to the design of its products  some of its products are based in part on standards  for which it does not hold patents or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
moreover  the company intends to seek additional international and united states patents on its technology 
there can be no assurance that additional patents will issue from any of the company s pending applications or applications in preparation  or be issued in all countries where the company s products can be sold  or that any claims allowed from pending applications or applications in preparation will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the company 
the company also generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and consultants and confidentiality and license agreements with its customers and potential customers  and limits access to and distribution of the source and object code of its software and other proprietary information 
with respect to its page description language software and drivers for the digital office market and in limited circumstances with respect to firmware and drivers for its optical storage products  the company grants licenses that give its customers access to and restricted use of the source code of the company s software which increases the likelihood of misappropriation or misuse of the company s technology 
accordingly  despite the company s precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s technology or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps the company takes will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or to provide an adequate remedy in the event of a breach or misappropriation by others 
furthermore  the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to establish the validity of its proprietary rights and in the past has incurred significant legal expenses in connection with claims of this type it has initiated 
any litigation by or against the company could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of its technical and management personnel  whether or not that litigation results in a favorable determination for the company 
in the event of an item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued adverse result in any litigation  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in developing new technology or that those licenses would be available on reasonable terms  or at all  and any development or license could require the company s expenditures of substantial time and other resources 
the company may be unable to obtain third party intellectual property rights and or may be liable for significant damages 
certain technology used in the company s products is licensed from third parties  and in connection with these licenses  the company is required to fulfill confidentiality obligations and  in some cases  pay royalties 
some of the company s products  require various types of copy protection software that the company must license from third parties 
should the company lose its rights to  or be unable to obtain the necessary copy protection software  the company would be unable to sell and market certain of its products 
the company s agreements with third parties often have no specified term and may be terminated by either party in the event of breach by the other 
the company s business could be adversely affected by the loss for any reason of these third party agreements 
given the trend to include increasing levels of functionality on a chip  in the future it may be necessary or desirable for the company to seek additional licenses to intellectual property rights held by third parties or purchase products manufactured and or sold by third parties with respect to some or all of its product offerings 
there can be no assurance that those licenses or purchases will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
the inability of the company to enter into those license arrangements on acceptable terms or to maintain its current licenses on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which has resulted in significant  often protracted and expensive litigation 
the company or its foundries may  from time to time  be notified of claims that the company may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
if it is necessary or desirable  the company may seek licenses under those patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  there can be no assurance that licenses will be offered or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to the company 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by the company could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities and suspend the manufacture of products or the use by the company s foundries of processes requiring the technology 
the company has historically indemnified its customers for certain costs and damages of patent infringement in circumstances where the company s product is the factor creating the customer s infringement exposure 
this practice generally excludes coverage in circumstances where infringement arises out of the combination of the company s products with products of others or where infringement arises based on modifications made by the customer to the company s products 
this indemnification practice  however  could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
although patent disputes in the semiconductor industry have often been settled through cross licensing arrangements  the company may not be able in any or every instance  to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
the company has a more limited patent portfolio than many of its competitors 
if a successful claim is made against the company or its customers and a license is not made available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or the company is required to pay substantial damages or awards  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
the company depends on third party foundries and vendors to manufacture products 
the company contracts with independent foundries to manufacture a majority of its products and with independent vendors to assemble and test these products 
the company s failure to adequately manage its relationships with these foundries and vendors could negatively impact its ability to manufacture and sell its products and its results of operations 
the company relies on its foundries to allocate to the company a portion of their foundry capacity sufficient to meet its needs to produce products of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yield and to deliver products to the company in a timely manner 
these foundries fabricate products for other companies and some manufacture products of their own design 
if these foundries fail or are unable to satisfy the company s item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued product  quality and other requirements  the company s business  financial condition and results of operation could suffer 
the company also relies on third party subcontractors to assemble and test its products 
the failure of any of these subcontractors to meet the company s production requirements could cause the company s business  financial condition and operating results to suffer 
the company s reliance on independent manufacturers and third party assembly and testing vendors involves a number of additional risks  including o the loss of any foundry as a supplier  o inability to expand foundry capacity in a period of increased demand for the company s products  o inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from current or future suppliers  o delays in shipments of the company s products  o disruption of operations at any of the company s manufacturing facilities  o product defects and the difficulty of detecting and remedying product defects  o the unavailability of  or interruption in access to  certain process technologies  and o reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
as the company generally does not use multiple services of supply for its products  the consequences of these factors occurring is magnified 
during the third calendar quarter of  taiwan  the location of the company s primary wafer manufacturer  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  experienced a severe earthquake 
to date  the company has not experienced any material delays of its wafer deliveries from its primary manufacturer 
however  there is a current shortage of foundry capacity that is expected to last at least through calendar although the company believes it has sufficient capacity to meet its needs through calendar  the company has no firm commitments in place  and therefore  there is no assurance that the company will be able to secure capacity for its manufacturing needs and or not experience delays in the future 
the company s failure to accurately forecast demand for its products could negatively impact its results of operations 
under its foundry agreements  the company is required to place non cancelable orders and purchase its products on an approximately three month rolling basis 
the company s customers  on the other hand  generally place purchase orders with the company less than four weeks prior to delivery that may be rescheduled or under certain circumstances may be cancelled  without significant penalty 
this limits the company s ability to react to fluctuations in demand for its products 
if the company overestimates the product necessary to fill orders  or fails to foresee a technology change that could render a product obsolete  it will build excess inventories which could harm its gross margins and operating results 
if the company underestimates the product necessary to fill orders  it may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of products which could harm its revenues 
the company has experienced inventory write offs of its optical storage products in the past primarily due to unforeseen and rapid changes in its customers demand  in particular speed changes  and consequently experienced rapid product obsolescence 
product supply and demand fluctuations common to the semiconductor industry are historically characterized by periods of manufacturing capacity shortages immediately followed by periods of overcapacity  which are caused by the addition of manufacturing capacity in large increments 
the industry has moved from a period of capacity shortages in to what has been a period of excess capacity for approximately the last twelve months  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and has now returned to a capacity shortage situation 
no assurance can be given that the company can or will achieve timely  cost effective access to that capacity when needed 
the company derives a large portion of its revenues from international sales  depends on foreign subcontractors and is subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 
a large portion of the company s revenues are derived from international sales 
international sales  principally to korea  japan  singapore and europe  accounted for approximately  and  of the company s net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company also depends on foreign subcontractors for the manufacture of its products 
most of the company s foreign sales and purchases are negotiated in us dollars  although invoicing is often done in local currency 
as a result  the company may be subject to the risks of currency fluctuations in the foreign countries in which it does business 
the company also is subject to other risks of conducting business outside of the united states 
these risks include o unexpected changes in  or impositions of  foreign legislative or regulatory requirements  o delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  o tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  o longer payment cycles  o greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  o potentially adverse taxes and adverse tax consequences  o the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  o political  social and economic instability  o potential hostilities  o changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and o fluctuations in foreign currencies the company s significant investment in foundry capacity in taiwan is a prime example of its exposure to these types of risks 
due to this investment  the company is subject to the risk of political instability in taiwan  including the potential for conflict between taiwan and the people s republic of china 
in addition  the fact that china is the primary market for the company s consumer dvd products is another example 
any political or economic instability in china could significantly reduce the demand for these products 
in addition  the company has several significant oem customers in japan  south korea  and other parts of asia 
although the adverse economic circumstances recently prevailing in japan and elsewhere in asia have begun to show signs of abating  they could still affect these customers willingness or ability to do business with the company in the future or their success in developing and launching in particular office devices containing the company s products 
while these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to forecast  any one or more of these factors could adversely affect the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
the company depends on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of its revenues  and a loss of  or a significant reduction in purchases by  current major customers would significantly reduce its item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenues 
the company has derived a substantial portion of its net revenues from a limited number of customers and expects this concentration to continue 
for fiscal  and sales to the company s top ten customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues  respectively 
in addition  the company has experienced significant changes from year to year in the composition of its major customer base and the company believes this pattern of significant change may continue 
customers generally purchase the company s products pursuant to short term purchase orders  and the company has no long term purchase agreements with any of its customers 
the loss of  or significant reduction in purchases by  current major customers of the company would significantly reduce its revenues 
the company is a defendant in several lawsuits 
the company and various of its current and former officers and directors are parties to a consolidated class action lawsuit filed on behalf of all persons who purchased or acquired the company s common stock for the period from july  to may   alleging state securities law and other violations 
additionally  various of the company s current and former officers and directors are defendants in three consolidated derivative actions which allege a breach of fiduciary duty and a claim under california securities laws 
based on its current information  the company believes the class action and derivative suits to be without merit and will defend its position vigorously 
although it is reasonably possible the company may incur losses upon resolution of these claims  an estimate of loss or range of loss cannot be made 
no provision for any liability that may result upon adjudication has been made in the company s financial statements 
the company is also a party to various other legal proceedings  including a number of patent related matters 
in the opinion of management  these patent related legal proceedings will not result in any material liability to the company 
in connection with these lawsuits  however  management time has been  and will continue to be  expended and the company has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  substantial legal and other expenses 
the company must continue to make significant capital investments  and the inability to raise the additional capital necessary to fund these investments on acceptable terms could seriously harm the company s business 
in order to remain competitive  the company must continue to make investments in new facilities and capital equipment  and significant amounts of capital additions could be required in subsequent years 
additionally  in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process techniques  the company has entered into and will continue to consider various possible transactions  including various take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
manufacturing arrangements such as these may require substantial capital investment  which may require the company to seek additional financing 
the company believes that existing liquid resources and funds generated from operations  if any  combined with its ability to borrow funds will be adequate to meet its operating and capital requirements and obligations into the foreseeable future 
the company believes that the level of a company s financial resources is an important factor in its industry 
accordingly  the company may from time to time seek additional equity or debt financing
