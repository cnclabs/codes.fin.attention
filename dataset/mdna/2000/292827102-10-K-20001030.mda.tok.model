in february  our board of directors approved a two for one common stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend 
the stock dividend was paid on april  to stockholders of record at the close of business on march  accordingly  the consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to reflect this event 
unless otherwise indicated  all share information in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflect the two for one stock split 
acquisitions the acquisitions closed during fiscal  and are as follows in april  cmgi acquired accipiter  which sells internet advertising management solutions for total purchase consideration of approximately million 
in august  accipiter was merged with us in a stock for stock merger in which shares of our series a convertible preferred stock were issued to cmgi 
we have reflected the acquisition of accipiter in our consolidated financial statements as if it occurred in april in march  adsmart corporation acquired can media  an online advertising representation firm for total purchase consideration of approximately million  inclusive of contingent consideration paid subsequent to the closing date 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values at the date of acquisition 
in april  we acquired i pro  which provides web site traffic measurement and audit services for total purchase consideration of approximately million 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method  and accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values at the date of acquisition

the acquisitions have been accounted for as a combination of entities under common control ie  as if pooling 
our results of operations reflect the results of operations of adsmart beginning april   can media beginning march  and flycast beginning january  in june  we acquired substantially all of the assets of the virtual billboard network for total purchase consideration of approximately million and interactive solutions inc for total purchase consideration of approximately million 
the acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method  and accordingly  the purchase prices have been allocated to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values at the date of acquisition 
in addition  in june  we acquired a majority ownership position in engage technologies japan  kk  our joint venture with sumitomo corporation 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenue  cost of revenue and gross margin media 
revenue from our media segment is derived primarily from the delivery of advertisements across our network of over  web sites 
pricing of advertising is generally based on cost per advertising impression and varies depending on whether the advertising is run across the network  across specific categories or on individual web sites 
in addition  revenue is also realized from advertising sold on a cost per click through basis  whereby the marketer advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on an advertising banner 
cost of revenue consists primarily of amounts paid to each web site in the network based on an agreed upon percentage of the revenue generated by advertisements run on each site as well as both internal and external ad serving costs 
revenue for our media segment increased from million in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   an increase 
gross margin for the media segment increased from a deficit of in the year ended july  to in the year ended july  the increase in revenue is primarily due to our acquisition of flycast which is primarily reflected in our third and fourth quarters of and  to a lesser extent  an increase in both the number of advertisers purchasing advertisements and the number of ad impressions delivered on the network 
additionally  in response to increased marketer demand for performance based pricing  revenue from our cost per click through business  as a percent of total revenue  increased in the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july  total impressions delivered in the year ended july  increased to over billion as compared to approximately billion impressions in the year ended july   primarily due to our acquisition of flycast 
effective cpm rates decreased approximately in the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july  the increase in the gross margin percentage for the year ended july  was primarily due to lower average web site payments and ad serving costs 
we expect that revenue growth within our media segment will continue to weaken throughout much of the next fiscal year 
we expect that excess media inventory in the market  combined with slowing demand due to reduced spending by dot com companies  will result in flat or reduced media revenue for the next two to three quarters 
we believe that traditional marketers will increase their online advertising spending throughout the next fiscal year and that late in the next fiscal year our media segment revenue will then begin to grow at a modest rate 
media management 
revenue from our media management segment is derived primarily from services that enable marketers to run and evaluate the effectiveness of marketing programs both within and outside our advertising network 
additionally  this segment also provides web site traffic measurement and analysis data and verification of site traffic and advertising results 
revenue for our media management segment increased from million in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   an increase 
gross margin for the media management segment increased from in the year ended july  to in the year ended july  the increase in revenue was primarily due to our acquisitions of both i pro and adknowledge  and to a lesser extent  an increase in i pro s customer base and growth in adknowledge s revenue subsequent to our acquisition of adknowledge 
the increase in the gross margin percentage for the year ended july  was a result of the significant increase in revenue without a related increase in cost of revenue as a large portion of our media management segment s cost of revenue is fixed  infrastructure related costs 
we expect that revenue from our media management segment will decline in the first fiscal quarter of as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of as advertisers and marketers reduce their spending on media  we anticipate that they also may reduce their spending to a lesser extent on related analytical and measurement services that our media management segment provides 
for the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july   we expect that media management revenue from our existing businesses may increase due to the fact that our fiscal results will include a full twelve months of adknowledge revenue as compared to only nine months of adknowledge revenue in fiscal software and consulting 
revenue from our software and consulting segment is derived primarily through the sale of software licenses and outsourced advertising management solutions utilizing our software and consulting services 
consulting services include fees charged for training  installation  software support and maintenance and actual consulting for customer specific requirements 
cost of revenue consists primarily of fees paid for outsourced data center operations needed to support our adbureau product as well as payroll  benefits and allocated overhead of our support and consulting groups 
revenue for our software and consulting segment increased from million in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a increase 
gross margin for this segment increased from in the year ended july  to in the year ended july  the increase in revenue was due to an increase in the number of new customers in both domestic and international markets and a larger quantity of high dollar license arrangements during the year ended july  we also realized a significant increase in revenue as a result of developing our channel programs with resellers and original equipment manufacturers 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we recorded million of software revenue from a license agreement with compaq computer corporation  a reseller that is also an affiliate 
additionally  our fiscal fourth quarter software revenue was positively impacted by two large sales of profileserver and admanager products aggregating approximately million 
as we do not expect to enter into similar transactions in future periods  our software license revenue will be expected to be below the level attained in the fourth quarter of fiscal during at least the first quarter of fiscal lastly  as a result of a growing customer base  consulting and support revenue has increased substantially in the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july  the increase in gross margin is due to an increase in revenue that exceeded the increase in costs due to an expanded customer base and a larger percentage of product license arrangements 
we anticipate that revenue for our software and consulting segment may increase significantly in the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july  although we do not anticipate recurring large software license arrangements in the year ended july  similar to the compaq arrangement  we expect that revenue from our profileserver and admanager products  as well as software and consulting revenue from our recent mediabridge acquisition  will grow steadily in both domestic and international markets 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs  consulting and contractor fees  facility related costs  such as rent and computer and network services  and depreciation expense 
our research and development expenses increased from million in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a increase 
this increase was primarily due to our acquisitions of i pro  adknowledge and flycast and to a lesser extent  the expansion of our research and development activities 
including acquisitions  our research and development staff increased from july  to july  research and development expenses were of revenue for the year ended july  compared to of revenue for the year ended july  this decrease is the direct result of the increase in year over year revenue 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs  consulting and professional fees  advertising expenses  costs of attending trade shows  employee travel and depreciation expense 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a increase 
the increase in costs was primarily due to the i pro  adknowledge and flycast acquisitions  the continuing expansion of our sales force and costs incurred to brand the engage name and build market awareness of our consolidated product offerings resulting from recent acquisitions 
in addition  a portion of the increase is due to continued expansion in international markets and the cost of maintaining sales and marketing efforts in foreign markets 
overall  including acquisitions  our sales and marketing staff increased from july  to july  sales and marketing expenses were of revenue for year ended july  compared to of revenue for the year ended july  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of payroll and related costs  consulting and professional fees  facility and related costs  bad debt expense and depreciation expense 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a increase 
the increase was primarily due to our acquisitions of i pro  adknowledge  and flycast and  to a lesser extent  an increase in payroll and related costs associated with developing an administrative infrastructure to support growing operations and increases in bad debt expense resulting from the significant increase in revenues 
general and administrative costs were of revenue for year ended july  compared to of revenue for the year ended july  this decrease is the direct result of the increase in year over year revenue 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of intangible assets increased from million in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a  increase 
the increase was due to amortization expense resulting from adsmart s acquisition of can in march  and our acquisitions of i pro in april  adknowledge in december  flycast in april and vbn  isi  and engage japan all in june intangible assets from the can acquisition are being amortized over five years 
intangible assets from the i pro acquisition are being amortized over three to five years  while intangible assets from the adknowledge  flycast  vbn  isi and engagetechnologies japan acquisitions are being amortized over three years 
all of our intangible assets are being amortized under the straight line method 
as a result of the mediabridge and space asia acquisitions that were consummated in fiscal  a large part of the purchase price will be recorded as goodwill and other intangible assets 
thus  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles will increase significantly in fiscal and thereafter 
we expect to amortize the mediabridge and space asia goodwill and intangible assets over three years 
we assess the need to record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present 
on an on going basis  management reviews the value and period of amortization or depreciation of long lived assets  including costs in excess of net assets of companies acquired 
during this review  the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost of long lived assets are reevaluated 
although the assumptions may vary from transaction to transaction  they generally include revenue growth  operating results  cash flows and other indicators of value 
management then determines whether there has been a permanent impairment of the value of long lived assets 
it is reasonably possible that the impairment factors evaluated by management will change in subsequent periods  given that we operate in a volatile business environment 
this could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
stock compensation 
stock compensation expense increased from million in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a  increase 
approximately million of the increase in stock compensation expense was related to stock compensation expense recorded for the acceleration of the vesting of approximately  cmgi stock options previously issued to four former executives of flycast under pre existing severance agreements 
additionally  we began to recognize stock compensation expense as a result of stock options granted during fiscal with exercise prices below the estimated fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant 
as a result of our acquisition of space asia and mediabridge  we expect to record approximately to million as deferred compensation relating to options exchanged and certain employee retention agreements 
the deferred compensation will be amortized as stock compensation expense over periods ranging from one to three years 
equity in loss of joint venture equity in loss of joint venture represents our share of our japanese joint venture s losses up until june  the month in which we acquired a majority ownership position of engage technologies japan and accordingly  began consolidating the results of operations of engage technologies japan 
as a result of acquiring additional ownership in engage technologies japan in june  our ownership increased from to 
equity in loss of joint venture was  in the year ended july   compared to million in the year ended july  the increase in our share of losses in the joint venture represents the joint venture s increase in staff and its continued investment in expanding its sales and marketing presence within its market 
interest income interest income increased from  in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a  increase 
during the year ended july   interest income was primarily earned from investing the proceeds of our initial public offering completed in july and from cash and investments we acquired in connection with our acquisition of flycast 
interest expense interest expense increased from million in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a increase 
in fiscal  adsmart and engage entered into arrangements with cmgi which required the accrual of interest on intercompany debt at a rate of per annum 
during the year ended july   interest expense was recorded on this debt 
the adsmart debt was converted into equity in connection with the closing of our acquisition of adsmart in april the engage debt was converted into equity during both fiscal and interest expense related to long term debt and capital lease obligations increased in the year ended july  over the year ended july  due to debt and capital lease obligation balances we assumed as part of the i pro  adknowledge and flycast acquisitions  and to a lesser extent  interest expense incurred by adsmart on its debt to cmgi 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenue and cost of revenue media 
revenue for our media segment increased from  in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a  increase 
gross margin deficit for the segment improved from in the year ended july  to in the year ended july  the increase in revenue is primarily due to the can acquisition  as well as an increase in both the number of advertisers purchasing advertisements and the number of ad impressions delivered on our network 
the increase in gross margin is the result of the significant increase in revenue in the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july  media management 
revenue for our media management segment increased from in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july  gross margin for the segment was in the year ended july  the increase in revenue was due to our acquisition of i pro in april software and consulting 
revenue for our software and consulting segment increased from million in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a increase 
gross margin increased from in the year ended july  to in the year ended july  the increase in revenue was due to an increase in the number of new customers in both domestic and international markets and a larger quantity of high dollar license arrangements during the year ended july  in addition  as a result of a growing customer base  consulting and support revenue increased substantially in the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a increase 
this increase was due to the inclusion of accipiter s operations for the entire year ended july   the inclusion of ipro s operations for four months in the year ended july   and to a lesser extent  the expansion of our research and development activities 
research and development expenses were of revenue for the year ended july  compared to of revenue for the year ended july  this decrease is the direct result of the increase in year over year revenue from july  to july  selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a increase 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in costs related to our acquisition of i pro 
additionally  the continuing expansion of our sales force contributed to the increase 
overall  including the acquisition of i pro our sales and marketing staff increased from july  to july  sales and marketing expenses were of revenue for the year ended july  compared to of revenue for the year ended july  the decrease as a percentage of revenue is the result of the increase in revenue during the period  offset somewhat by costs incurred in an effort to begin the re branding of engage 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a increase 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs associated with the support of growing operations and from the inclusion of i pro s operations for a portion of the year ended july  general and administrative costs were of revenue for the year ended july  compared to of revenue for the year ended july  the decrease as a percentage of revenue is the result of spreading fixed costs over a larger revenue base 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of intangible assets increased from million in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a increase 
the increase was due to our acquisitions of accipiter in april and i pro in april intangible assets from the accipiter and i pro acquisitions are being amortized over three to five years  all under the straight line method 
stock compensation 
stock compensation expense increased from  in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a increase 
beginning in april  we commenced the recognition of compensation expense relating to shares of cmgi common stock held in escrow to be issued to employee stockholders of accipiter who satisfy a two year employment continuation provision 
additionally  stock compensation costs of  were recorded during fiscal as a result of stock options granted during with exercise prices below the estimated fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant 
equity in loss of joint venture equity in loss of joint venture was  in the year ended july  in august  we acquired of the shares of engage technologies japan  a joint venture with sumitomo corporation in japan 
our ownership interest was subsequently reduced to after the issuance of additional equity to a new investor in the joint venture 
in the year ended july   the joint venture was accounted for under the equity method whereby our portion of the joint venture s losses were included in our results of operations 
interest income interest income was  in the year ended july  during the year ended july   interest income was earned from investing the proceeds of our initial public offering completed in july interest expense interest expense increased from  in the year ended july  to million in the year ended july   a increase 
during fiscal  we entered into an arrangement with cmgi that required us to accrue interest on intercompany debt at a rate of per annum 
during the year ended july   interest expense was recorded on this debt  all of which was converted into equity in connection with our initial public offering in july during  adsmart also entered into a similar financing arrangement with cmgi 
all of adsmart s debt with cmgi was converted into adsmart equity and then engage common stock in connection with our acquisition of adsmart in april liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents increased from million at july  to million at july  net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended july  cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from net losses and an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities  which were partially offset by an increase in both accounts payable and due to cmgi and affiliates 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended july  during the year ended july  we purchased million in marketable securities and acquired million of equipment to support growth and expansion 
these uses were offset by million in proceeds from the redemption of marketable securities and million in cash acquired in acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and consisted primarily of million of proceeds received from cmgi to fund the operations of adsmart prior to our acquiring adsmart on april   and million received from both the sale of common stock in a private placement and stock option exercises 
as of july   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we anticipate that expenditures may continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we accelerate the growth of our business 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate investment opportunities in businesses that management believes will complement our marketing strategies 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the near term future 
in addition  cmgi has committed to make available to us up to million in the form of debt  equity or a combination thereof to fund our working capital requirements  subject to negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions and approval of both companies respective boards of directors 
we believe that additional external financing will be available through strategic partnerships  sales of additional equity or other debt instruments 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders may experience dilution of their interest in us 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to continue as a going concern  to fund our expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures may be significantly limited 
in process research and development iprd we allocated part of the purchase price of our accipiter  i pro  adknowledge and flycast acquisitions to iprd as part of our allocation of the purchase price of each allocation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to amounts allocated to iprd 
foreign operations the results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
as of july   we had subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany  france  sweden  italy and australia  canada and japan 
to date  our financial condition and results of operations have not been materially affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
however  as these operations continue to grow  and operations are commenced in additional countries  there can be no guarantee that our financial condition and results of operations will not be adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
subsequent events on august   we completed our acquisition of space media holdings limited  a leading independent internet marketing network in asia  in an all stock transaction 
in connection with the acquisition  we issued approximately  shares of our common stock 
approximately  shares are being held in escrow for a period of at least one year 
these shares held in escrow are intended to secure the obligations of the former space media stockholders to indemnify us under the acquisition agreement 
in addition   shares are being held in escrow to ensure the satisfaction of certain performance objectives by space media 
on september   we completed our acquisition of mediabridge technologies  inc  a leading provider of cross media closed loop targeted marketing systems 
the acquisition was completed pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger  dated as of june  that we entered into with engage subsidiary  inc  a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  and mediabridge 
in connection with the acquisition  we issued approximately  shares of our common stock merger shares 
additionally  we have reserved approximately  shares of our common stock for issuance upon exercise of stock options to purchase shares of our common stock which stock options option holders received in exchange for stock options to purchase mediabridge common stock 
of the merger shares issued at the closing of the acquisition  approximately  shares are being held in escrow for a period of at least one year 
these shares held in escrow are intended to secure the obligations of the former mediabridge stockholders to indemnify us under the merger agreement 
by virtue of the merger of mediabridge and engage subsidiary  inc  mediabridge became a wholly owned subsidiary of engage 
the transaction is intended to be tax free under section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and will be accounted for as a purchase 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock we have incurred substantial losses and anticipate incurring continued losses 
we have never been profitable 
we have incurred net losses totaling million from inception to july  while we do not expect to increase our spending significantly  we do expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve profitability 
we may not achieve profitability 
if our revenue grows more slowly than we currently anticipate or if our operating expenses either increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in light of lower revenue  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
we may have difficulty managing our expanding operations 
we have recently experienced a period of rapid growth 
this growth has placed a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
our total revenue increased from million in the fiscal year ended july   to million in the fiscal year ended july  to million for the fiscal year ended july  our number of employees increased from as of july  to  as of july  in addition  our acquisitions of adknowledge  adsmart  flycast and mediabridge have placed additional strain on our resources 
to accommodate this growth  we must implement new or upgraded operating and financial systems  procedures and controls throughout many different locations 
we may not succeed in these efforts 
failure to expand and integrate these areas in an efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we continue to grow  we will need to recruit  train and retain a significant number of employees  particularly employees with technical  marketing and sales backgrounds 
these individuals are in high demand 
we may not be able to attract the staff we need 
the acceptance and effectiveness of internet advertising is not yet fully established 
our future success is dependent in part on an increase in the use of the internet as an advertising medium 
the internet advertising market is new and rapidly evolving  and it cannot yet be compared with traditional advertising media to gauge its effectiveness 
as a result  demand for and market acceptance of internet advertising solutions are uncertain 
in addition  there are software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to a user s computer 
web users widespread adoption of such software would significantly undermine the commercial viability of internet advertising 
if the market for internet advertising fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
there are currently no generally accepted standards for the measurement of the effectiveness of internet advertising and standard measurements may need to be developed to support and promote internet advertising as a significant advertising medium 
our advertising customers may challenge or refuse to accept our or third party measurements of advertisement delivery requests from the web sites of web publishers using our solutions 
the acceptance and effectiveness of the internet as a medium for consumer transactions is not yet fully established 
our future success is dependent in part on an increase in the use of the internet for business transactions with consumers 
the electronic commerce market is new and rapidly evolving and the extent of consumer acceptance of the internet is uncertain 
if a sufficiently broad base of consumers does not accept the use of the internet for transacting business  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our revenues could be affected by the loss of clients in the internet and e commerce industries 
a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from clients in the internet and e commerce industries 
due to recent volatility in the financial markets  several firms in the internet and e commerce industries have failed and several more may fail in the near term future 
if one or more of our customers ceases to exist  discontinues or reduces the use of our services  our business  financial condition and results of operations could materially suffer 
we cannot assure you that our clients will have the financial resources to continue to use our services in the future 
in addition  because a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of customers  the non payment or late payment of amounts due from these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in acquiring and integrating new technologies or businesses 
we have acquired ten companies since our inception  and we intend in the future to continue to acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  products  services or technologies 
we may not be successful in integrating and managing the operations of the businesses we have acquired or may acquire and  accordingly may not realize the expected benefits from such businesses 
we could have difficulty in assimilating acquired products  services or technologies into our operations 
in addition  we may have difficulty marketing and selling our new products and services from our recent acquisitions in a timely and efficient manner 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
if we do not successfully integrate any acquired business or if the benefits of any acquisition do not meet the expectations of financial or industry analysts  the market price of our common stock may decline 
furthermore  we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities could dilute our existing stockholders 
we have recorded substantial amounts of goodwill and related amortization expense related to our past acquisitions  and we will incur additional future amortization as a result of the mediabridge and space media acquisitions that were completed after the fiscal year ended july  if the benefits of the acquisitions do not exceed the costs associated with them  including any dilution to our stockholders resulting from the issuance of shares in connection with the acquisitions  our financial results and common stock price could be adversely affected 
our profile based solutions have been commercially available for only a limited period of time  and it is uncertain whether these solutions will achieve widespread customer acceptance 
in july  we released our engage knowledge data service for sale to customers 
in october  we introduced our profile based audience profiles formerly named audiencenet network for advertisers on the web 
the profiling capabilities used to create and maintain the engage knowledge data service serve as the platform for most of our planned profile based products and services 
we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will depend on sales of products and services incorporating our profiling technology 
to date  however  only a small portion of our revenue is attributable to profile based products and services 
there can be no assurance that products and services based on the engage knowledge database  or its profiling approach for the creation of anonymous profiles  will achieve widespread customer acceptance  and any failure to do so would impair our revenues and our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
profile based targeting may not achieve its intended benefits and our revenue therefore may not grow as expected 
our products and services are designed to enable web advertisers  merchants and sites to target their intended audiences more effectively 
because our profiling technology is new  we cannot be sure that the use of our anonymous profiles will result in more effective targeting of advertisements or other marketing and promotional activities 
our revenue will be adversely affected if advertisers and merchants do not perceive that the use of profiles will improve the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns or if our customers are otherwise unable to generate a sufficient return on investment from the use of our profiles 
if the use of our profile based products and services does not demonstrably improve the responsiveness of web visitors  then we would have difficulty selling our profile based products  and our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
the value of our engage knowledge database depends on continued contributions of data from web sites 
decisions by web sites and networks not to contribute their data to the engage knowledge database would hinder the quality and growth of the engage knowledge database and could severely impair the effectiveness and value of engage audience profiles and future profile based products 
to participate in audience profiles  web sites must agree to contribute user data to the engage knowledge database  and there can be no assurance that web sites will not decline to participate in audience profiles or other engage enabled networks due to concerns relating to sharing proprietary information about their users and perceived privacy concerns 
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations  and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future results 
our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  not all of which are in our control 
future revenue is difficult to forecast and for the foreseeable future will be influenced by the timing and amount of sales to new customers  as well as user traffic levels and advertising and electronic commerce activity on our customers web sites 
the market for online marketing products and services is new 
as a result  we must educate potential customers on the use and benefits of our products and services 
in addition  the implementation of the engage knowledge data service requires a significant commitment of resources by participating web sites and networks 
it can  in some cases  take our sales organization several months to finalize a sale 
this makes it difficult for us to predict the quarter in which a sale may occur 
in addition  we believe that our revenue will be subject to seasonal fluctuations because advertisers generally place fewer advertisements during the first and third calendar quarters of each year 
in addition  expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical  reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy generally  which could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or the time periods in which they determine their budgets  could cause our business  results of operations and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected 
many of our expenses  particularly personnel costs and rent  are relatively fixed  and are incurred in part based on expectations of future revenue 
we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in operating results in any quarter 
because of these factors  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
it is possible that  in future periods  our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
we have only been in business for a short period of time 
we began commercial shipments of our first software products in early  and we face risks  expenses and uncertainties as an early stage company  particularly in the new and rapidly evolving internet market 
because we only recently commenced commercial sales  our past results and rates of growth may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of our future performance 
we anticipate that we will continue to be controlled by cmgi  whose interests may differ from other stockholders 
cmgi currently beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
accordingly  cmgi has and will continue to have the power to elect our entire board of directors and to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
the interests of cmgi may differ from the interests of the other stockholders 
future decisions by cmgi as to the disposition of any or all of its ownership position in engage could be influenced by the possible need of cmgi to maintain control of us in order for cmgi to avoid becoming a registered investment company 
registration as an investment company would subject cmgi to numerous regulatory requirements with which cmgi would have difficulty complying 
as a result  cmgi may be motivated to maintain at least a majority ownership position of engage  even if its other stockholders might consider a sale of control to be in their best interests 
as long as it is a majority stockholder  cmgi has contractual rights to purchase shares in any financing we undertake sufficient to maintain its majority ownership position 
cmgi s ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of engage or discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
a material portion of our growth to date has been attributable to sales to cmgi affiliates 
in fiscal  of our customers were either affiliates of ours or affiliates of cmgi 
in fiscal  sales of products and services to affiliates of cmgi and to our affiliates accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of our total revenue 
to the extent that our growth in revenue has been attributable to sales of products and services to these affiliates  there can be no assurance that our historical rate of growth is an indication of our future prospects 
the terms of our sales to cmgi affiliates could change 
while we believe that the transactions between engage and other affiliates of cmgi have been on arms length terms  it is possible that we might have received more favorable terms than we would have if we were not an affiliate of cmgi 
in addition  the terms of our sales to affiliated customers could change if these customers cease to be affiliates of cmgi in the future 
cmgi has been and continues to be instrumental in introducing us to customers and other business partners 
if the relationship between engage and cmgi ended or was fundamentally altered  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we do not have a history of financial reporting for engage and all our recent acquisitions as a combined entity 
in the year ended july  we completed six acquisitions 
in december  we acquired adknowledge inc  a provider of products and services which allow online marketers and agencies to plan  target  serve track and analyze advertising campaigns 
in april  we acquired both adsmart corporation  an online advertising network and flycast communications corporation  a leading provider of internet direct response advertising solutions 
in june  we acquired substantially all of the assets of the virtual billboard network  one of the largest ad networks of canada 
in june  we also acquired a majority ownership position in engage technologies japan kk  our joint venture with sumitomo corporation and we acquired interactive solutions inc  a japanese online advertising company previously owned by sumitomo corporation 
our financial statements reflect the results of adsmart back to april  and of flycast back to january  since the acquisitions are being accounted for as an as if pooling 
otherwise  our financial statements do not reflect the pre acquisition results of these acquisitions on a pro forma basis for fiscal some comparisons between fiscal and fiscal  particularly increases in revenue and operating expenses  may be greater than they would have been had the comparisons been done on a pro forma basis 
for this reason  our future reported financial results may not be comparable to our historically reported financial results 
if our future financial results are not comparable to our historical financial results our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
growing concerns about the use of cookies and data collection may limit our ability to develop user profiles 
web sites typically place small files of information commonly known as cookies on a user s hard drive  generally without the user s knowledge or consent 
cookie information is passed to the web site through the internet user s browser software 
our technology currently uses cookies to collect information about an internet user s movement through the internet 
most currently available internet browsers allow users to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being stored on their hard drive  and a small minority of users are currently choosing to do so 
users can also delete cookies from their hard drive at any time 
some internet commentators and privacy advocates have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies 
the effectiveness of our technology could be limited by any reduction or limitation in the use of cookies 
recently  microsoft corporation announced that it intends to change the design and instrumentation of its web browser in such a way as to give users the option to accept or reject third party cookies 
giving users the option to decline such cookies could result in a reduction of the number of internet users we are capable of profiling anonymously 
such changes also could adversely affect our ability to determine the reach of advertising campaigns run by our engage media division and the frequency with which users of sites in the engage media network see the same advertisement 
a change  such as that announced by microsoft  would primarily affect third party ad networks like engage  potentially making portal web sites such as yahoo 
com and msn 
com a relatively more attractive advertising venue 
if the use or effectiveness of cookies is limited  we would likely have to switch to other technology that would allow us to gather demographic and behavioral information 
while such technology currently exists  it is substantially less effective than cookies 
replacement of cookies could require significant reengineering time and resources  might not be completed in time to avoid negative consequences to our business  financial condition or results of operations  and might not be commercially feasible 
in addition  privacy concerns may cause some web users to be less likely to visit web sites that contribute data to the engage knowledge database 
if enough web users choose not to visit sites providing information to the engage knowledge database  our ability to attract participants to engage audience profiles would be adversely affected 
this would  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
legislation or regulations may be adopted that could affect our ability to generate or use information for profiles and may hinder our ability to conduct business 
the legal and regulatory environment governing the internet and the use of information about web users is uncertain and may change 
united states legislators in the past have introduced a number of bills aimed at regulating the collection and use of personal data from internet users and additional similar bills are being considered during the current congressional session 
one bill  as currently drafted  would require internet users to affirmatively consent before a cookie is set on their browser for any purpose  with certain limited exceptions 
if passed into law without modification  this bill would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the european union has recently adopted a directive addressing data privacy that may result in limitations on the collection and use of specific personal information regarding internet users 
in addition  germany has imposed its own laws protecting data that can become personally identifiable through subsequent processing 
other countries may also enact limitations on the use of personal data 
to date  these regulations have not materially restricted the use of our products 
however  legislation or regulations may in the future be adopted which may limit our ability to target advertising or collect and use information in one or more countries  and growing public concerns about internet privacy could encourage legislators and regulators and government agencies to adopt such laws and regulations 
any legislation  regulation or other legal action that limits our ability to target advertising or collect and use information about internet users could hinder our ability to sell some of our products and could materially and adversely affect our business 
in addition  a number of laws and regulations have been and may be adopted covering issues such as pricing  acceptable content  taxation and quality of products and services on the internet 
such legislation could dampen the growth in use of the internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications and commercial medium 
in addition  due to the global nature of the internet  it is possible that multiple federal  state or foreign jurisdictions might inconsistently regulate our activities and customers 
any of the foregoing developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have many competitors and may not be able to compete effectively 
the markets for internet advertising  user targeting and web site assessment tools are intensely competitive 
we compete directly with providers of profiling technology  such as personify  and indirectly with applications that include more limited profiling capability integrated into their solutions  such as broadvision and vignette 
we also compete with companies such as doubleclick  media and matchlogic that have the ability to aggregate large quantities of customer behavior data across their networks 
the primary competitors to our advertising management software are systems provided by netgravity  a subsidiary of doubleclick  and real media 
in the outsourced ad serving market  we compete with providers of ad serving services  including adforce  which cmgi acquired in january  and doubleclick 
in the advertising sales market  our primary competitors are doubleclick and media 
our traffic measurement and analysis services and software compete with software offered by accrue  andromedia  net 
genesis and webtrends  and our audit services compete with abc interactive  bpa and pricewaterhousecoopers 
we also encounter competition from a number of other sources  including content aggregation companies  companies operating advertising sales networks  advertising agencies and other companies that facilitate internet advertising and electronic commerce 
with respect to our enterprise software that is used to create  plan  deliver and refine integrated promotional campaigns  we experience competition from many competitors  in both the traditional marketing sector as well as the emerging internet promotions sector 
the principal competitors of the engage media network are doubleclick  media and valueclick 
the principal competitor of our adknowledge solution is doubleclick s dart for agencies product 
in the ad serving product market  the primary competitors of our admanager software are netgravity  a subsidiary of doubleclick  and real media 
in the outsourced ad serving market  our adbureau service competes with providers of ad serving services  such as those offered by adforce and doubleclick 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development  undertake more far reaching marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees  strategic partners  advertisers and web publishers 
our competitors may develop products or services that are equal or superior to our solutions or that achieve greater market acceptance than our solutions 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully or competitive pressures may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
companies doing business on the internet  including engage  must also compete with television  radio  cable and print media for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
our systems may fail or experience slowdowns and we could lose key data used in our user profiles 
all of our communications hardware and other data center operations are provided internally and through multiple hosting services firms on the east and west coasts 
fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events could damage these systems  including loss of data used to create our user profiles 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if our systems were affected by any of these occurrences or if any data used in the engage knowledge database were lost 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in our systems or loss of data 
our future success depends in part on the efficient performance of our ad serving systems  as well as the efficient performance of the systems of third parties  such as our internet service providers 
an increase in the volume of advertising delivered through our servers could strain the capacity of the software or hardware that we have deployed  which could lead to slower response times or system failures and adversely affect the availability of advertisements  the number of advertising views received by advertisers and our revenue 
to the extent that we do not effectively address any capacity constraints or system failures  our customers may choose competing services and as a result our business may be materially adversely affected 
our software products may contain defects  which could result in delayed or lost revenue  expensive corrections  liability to our customers and claims against us 
we design  develop and sell complex ad serving  profiling and promotional marketing software that are crucial to the operation of the businesses of our customers 
defects in the solutions we develop could result in delayed or lost revenue  adverse customer reaction and negative publicity about engage or our products and services or require expensive corrections 
in addition  third party technology that is included in our products could contain errors or defects 
customers who are not satisfied with our products or services could bring claims against us for substantial damages  which  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and could result in costly litigation and payment of damages 
such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we cannot deliver satisfactory support and maintenance services to our clients  our revenues may be harmed 
following installation  our products generally require continuing support and maintenance services 
if demand for post implementation support and maintenance is higher than we expect  we may not have sufficient personnel to deliver these services in a timely and effective manner to our customers 
in addition  implementation of our solution may result in problems with our customer s information technology systems over which we have no control 
if our support and maintenance services personnel cannot resolve these problems or otherwise satisfy our customers demands for services  they may not purchase additional product upgrades to existing products or services from us 
in addition  our reputation with potential customers may be damaged 
any inability to deliver satisfactory support and maintenance services to our clients could harm our revenues 
our recently acquired subsidiary  mediabridge technologies  has in the past faced situations in which it was unable to provide product support and maintenance services of the level expected by particular customers  and there may be future circumstances in which it is also unable to do so 
if we fail to establish  maintain or expand third party reseller and implementation relationships  our ability to penetrate the market will be limited 
we distribute our products and services  in part  through reseller and implementation relationships 
we have a limited number of third party reseller and implementation relationships  and we may not be able to increase the number or scope of our reseller and implementation relationships or maintain our existing relationships 
our failure to increase the number of our reseller and implementation relationships or maintain our existing relationships may limit our ability to penetrate the market 
our distribution relationships generally do not prevent third party resellers and implementation providers from selling products of other companies  including products that may compete with our products 
these distributors could give higher priority to the products of other companies or to their own products  than they give to our products 
as a result  the loss of  or a significant reduction in sales volume to our current or future resellers or implementation providers could seriously harm our revenue and operating results 
in addition  a significant increase in sales through these channels could also negatively impact our gross margins  as sales through these channels generally have lower revenue per unit than direct sales 
moreover  if these firms fail to implement our products successfully for their customers  we may not have the resources to implement our products on the schedule required by these customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate increased revenue 
we may need additional financing which could be difficult to obtain 
we intend to grow our business rapidly and expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
therefore  we may require external financing in the future 
obtaining additional financing will be subject to a number of factors  including market conditions our operating performance investor sentiment  particularly for internet related companies these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of additional financing unattractive for us 
if we are unable to raise capital to fund our growth  we would not be able to execute our business plan and our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
technological change may render our products and services obsolete 
the internet market is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product announcements and enhancements and changing customer demands 
the introduction of new products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products and services obsolete 
our success depends on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and to improve the performance  features and reliability of our services and products in response to changing customer and industry demands 
furthermore  we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design  development  testing  introduction or marketing of services 
new services or enhancements to existing services may not adequately meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers or achieve any degree of significant market acceptance 
we face risks associated with our international operations and plans for expansion 
we have operations in a number of international markets 
we intend to continue to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing efforts 
to date  we have limited experience in developing localized versions of our solutions and in marketing  selling and distributing our solutions internationally 
we have established direct sales offices in the united kingdom  france  italy  sweden  canada  australia  germany  hong kong  korea  malaysia  thailand and japan 
we intend to enter other international markets primarily by partnering with locally based third parties  including entering into joint ventures and distribution arrangements 
our success in such markets is directly dependent on the success of our business partners and their dedication of sufficient resources to the relationship 
international operations are subject to other inherent risks  including compliance with the laws and regulations of different countries difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights in some countries difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations fluctuations in currency exchange rates these risks may materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we depend on the continued viability of the internet infrastructure 
our success depends upon the development and maintenance of a viable internet infrastructure 
the current internet infrastructure may be unable to support an increased number of users 
the timely development and acceptance of products such as high speed modems and communications equipment will be necessary to continue reliable web access 
furthermore  the web has experienced outages and delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure 
such outages and delays  could adversely affect web sites and the level of traffic on our customers sites 
the effectiveness of the web may decline due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols designed to support increased levels of activity 
if such new infrastructure  standards or protocols are developed  we may be required to incur substantial expenditures to adapt our products to the new technologies 
our business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we seek to protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications or trademark registrations will be approved  or even if approved  would not be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent misappropriation of our solutions or technologies  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
our profiling technology collects and utilizes data derived from user activity on our customers web sites 
this data is used for advertising and content targeting 
although we believe that we have the right to use such data and the compilation of such data in our database  we cannot assure you that any trade secret  copyright or other protection will be available for such information 
in addition  others may claim rights to such information 
our business will suffer if we are unable to retain key personnel 
we depend on the services of our senior management and key technical personnel 
in particular  our success depends on the continued efforts of our president and chief executive officer  paul l 
schaut  our group president of engage media  deborah mcwhinney  and our chief technology officer  daniel jaye  with whom we do not have employment agreements 
the loss of the services of any key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we will continue to rely on cmgi for various administrative services  and conflicts of interest could arise in the provision of such services 
we have entered into a facilities and administrative support agreement with cmgi under which cmgi will continue to make available space at its headquarters in massachusetts and will provide various services to us  including facilities  computer and information systems  telecommunications  utilities and employee benefits administration 
we also occupy facilities that are leased by cmgi  whereby cmgi charges us for our share of rent and related facility costs through an allocation based upon the our headcount in relation to total headcount for all cmgi companies located on the premises 
we have not independently determined the market value for these services and may be paying more than fair market value for them if this allocation method does not fairly reflect our use of these services or if cmgi were obtaining them at rates greater than their fair market value 
this agreement may be amended by agreement of cmgi and engage 
it is possible that personnel of cmgi providing these services may encounter conflicts of interests such as demands on their time by cmgi that might detract from their level of availability or service to us 
in addition  our reliance on these services could result in higher costs than would be incurred if we were to obtain such services from an unrelated third party 
our stock price is likely to be highly volatile 
the price at which our common stock will trade has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to a number of factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations changes in or our failure to meet securities analysts expectations technological innovations increased competition conditions and trends in the internet and other technology industries general market conditions item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the carrying values of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and notes payable  approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
we have historically had very low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and as such  have not used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk 
as we expand globally  the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may increase 
therefore  in the future  we may consider utilizing derivative instruments to mitigate such risks
