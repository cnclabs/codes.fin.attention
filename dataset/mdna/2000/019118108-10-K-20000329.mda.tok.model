product sales  security systems and services and engineering and technical were provided solely by mecar and a related company  sedachim  the vsk group and bri  respectively

all references herein to allied or the company shall refer to allied research corporation as a whole 
an agreement to sell the stock of bri was executed in early december   accordingly  bri s operations have been excluded from allied s results from continuing operations and the net results of such operations are reported separately as results from discontinued operation 
the results for prior periods have been correspondingly restated 
the stock of bri was sold in march  in  allied reorganized its european holdings 
a belgium holding company  arc europe  sa  now owns all of the capital stock of each of mecar  sedachim and the vsk group

in addition  such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general domestic and international economic conditions including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations  increasing competition by foreign and domestic competitors  including new entrants  and other future factors 
trends in operations allied reported disappointing results in  principally due to losses incurred at mecar 
mecar s performance resulted from the combination of a reduction in customer orders during and early and additional costs incurred by mecar in reworking ammunition orders for some of its customers 
mecar s performance improved in the fourth quarter of as it began to recognize revenues from new orders received earlier in the year 
mecar did not receive any substantial orders from march until june which seriously depleted its backlog 
allied believes that the lack of orders received by mecar from early until mid was the result of low oil prices which adversely impacted the purchasing power of its principal customers 
as oil prices stabilized and then increased in and into  mecar received substantial orders from these customers 
with the rebound in oil prices  mecar received over of new orders from early june  through december  however  as a result of the lead time necessary to order and receive raw materials and to ramp up for production  revenues from these new orders were not reflected until later in the fourth quarter of in addition  unanticipated delays in receipt of some raw materials adversely affected the results 
such materials have now been received 
mecar also incurred unanticipated costs in due to rework of ammunition for some of its customers 
the last portion of the rework was completed and shipped in early mecar began with a healthy backlog of approximately in early  mecar received an additional order of  thereby providing mecar the opportunity to have a very successful a portion of mecar s backlog consists of orders for ammunition for two new weapon systems acquired by mecar s principal customers via the foreign military sales program fms 
in june   mecar received the first production order for ammunition for one of these systems following successful completion of testing of the system and the initial order of ammunition 
in late december   mecar received the initial order for ammunition for the second system 
once the system and ammunition for this second system have passed acceptance testing  it is anticipated that the customer will begin to place production orders for ammunition 
the customer has indicated a need to acquire substantial quantities of both weapon systems and a need and desire to make substantial purchases of ammunition for both systems which should span several years 
while mecar received a relatively small order approximately in from a new customer which it believes could lead to follow on awards  the vast majority of the orders received by mecar in and in to date originated from its principal customers 
the vsk group recorded another excellent year in it contributed approximately in revenues and in profits 
the vsk group s results were due  in part  to the successful introduction of two new products 
in addition  the vsk group continued to expand its distribution network  including the addition of distributors in the uk and in germany 
yk concerns by vsk group customers also positively impacted the vsk group s business in the latter portion of in december   the vsk group acquired vigitec  sa  a small closed circuit television and telecommunications firm located in brussels  belgium 
the acquisition expands the range of products and services offered by the vsk group 
allied and the vsk group continue to seek other acquisitions for the vsk group 
both mecar s and the vsk group s reported earnings for the year were adversely impacted by the fluctuations of the belgian franc and the euro during bri reported a loss in due to insufficient work and unexpected costs incurred in final testing of a mobile dynomometer sold to a foreign government agency 
the results are reported as a loss from discontinued operation of  since allied agreed to sell bri in december  the stock of bri was sold in march  allied commenced with a consolidated backlog of approximately compared with a consolidated backlog at the beginning of of  in early  mecar received an additional order of mecar began with a backlog of approximately compared with a beginning backlog of vsk began with a backlog of approximately compared with a beginning backlog of approximately allied s backlog is one of the largest backlogs it has had since the early s 
in future periods  allied s operations will continue to be impacted by mecar s ability to obtain large orders on a periodic basis and allied s ability to successfully continue its expansion of other business 
trends in liquidity and capital resources allied s liquidity deteriorated in largely as a result of the loss incurred by mecar 
however  no liquidity problems are forecast for mecar has obtained a bank line of credit to provide working capital necessary to fund its operations 
it is anticipated that mecar will have fully repaid all amounts drawn under the line of credit by the end of in the longer term  allied s liquidity will continue to depend upon its ability to obtain substantial orders from its traditional customer base and the success of its efforts to broaden its revenue base 
liquidity 
allied s liquidity deteriorated in  principally as a result of losses incurred at mecar 
working capital  which includes restricted cash  was approximately at december   which is a decrease of from the december  level 
allied s current working capital is required for operations and to support credit facility agreements 
cash and equivalents at december  decreased over year end levels largely due to losses at mecar and bri 
restricted cash decreased from year end amounts since contracts received by mecar in in connection with the fms programs did not require the deposit of cash collateral 
accounts receivable at december  decreased from december  levels by due to unusually large shipments of products at the end of and reduced activity at the end of costs and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased by from as a result of reduced amounts of work in progress at the end of inventories at year end were essentially unchanged from year end levels 
prepaid expenses decreased from levels as a result of lower advance payments made on contracts in process at the end of net assets of discontinued operation ie  bri decreased by primarily as a result of losses sustained by bri during deferred taxes increased in by as a result of loss carryforwards generated at mecar by virtue of its operating loss 
current liabilities decreased by from december  due to a substantial reduction in accounts payable and customer deposits at the end of due to lower production levels 
during  and  allied funded its operations principally with internally generated cash and back up credit facilities required for foreign government contracts 
mecar typically obtains relatively large orders for its ammunition and weapon systems which require credit facilities to provide import letters of credit  advance payment guarantees and performance bonds 
these needs have been met in the last few years via agreements primarily with a multi member foreign bank pool 
as has been the case in recent years  the bank pool must agree to extend such facility to new orders as they are received by mecar 
while management believes that it will be able to finance additional mecar contracts using the bank pool structure  there can be no assurance that such financing will be provided 
the bank pool agreement and other loan agreements continue to impose certain restrictions on mecar 
mecar s obligations were collateralized at december  by a pledge on mecar s assets of the bank pool agreement further precludes mecar from making payments to any company in the allied group in excess of per year  unless mecar has unrestricted cash in excess of mecar s obligations under the bank agreement  after giving effect to the european reorganization of arc europe  are also supported by a guarantee provided by allied and by a pledge of the shares of the vsk group 
mecar received no advance payments under either of the two fms program contracts received in  nor do such contracts require advance payment guarantees performance bonds 
mecar has secured a million line of credit from one of the bank pool participants necessitated by the losses incurred in and the purchases required to process its backlog of orders 
mecar has a mortgage loan with a foreign government agency which had an outstanding balance of approximately at december  principal and interest payments on the mortgage loan extend through january   and the loan includes a prepayment penalty clause 
the vsk group operated throughout primarily from cash generated from operations 
the purchase price for the acquisition of vigitec  sa came from available cash 
the vsk group is obligated on several mortgages and other long term obligations with december  balances aggregating it is also obligated on letters of credit required by a contract with a customer 
on january   eleven member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the euro is currently trading on currency exchanges and the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  during the transition period  cash less payments can be made in the euro  and parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
between january   and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
allied will continue to evaluate all issues involving introduction of the euro as further accounting  tax and governmental legal and regulatory guidance becomes available 
based on current information and allied s current assessment  allied does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material adverse effect on its business or financial condition 
mecar has adopted the euro as its functional currency 
the vsk group continues to use the belgium franc as its primary currency 
bri operated throughout from cash generated from operations supplemented by a credit facility and advances made by allied 
allied guaranteed bri s obligations under the credit facility 
the credit facility consisted of a line of credit  which was increased to in  as well as a cash collateralized letter of credit facility 
at december   the line of credit had an outstanding balance of in connection with the sale of bri  the bank debt and all intercompany obligations of bri to allied were paid in full prior to closing 
in september  allied s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to  shares of allied s common stock 
to date  the company has made modest repurchases under the share repurchase program 
the timing and size of any future stock repurchases are subject to market conditions  stock prices  allied s cash position and other cash requirements going forward 
allied s ability to cover its anticipated future operating and capital requirements is dependent upon its ability to generate positive cash flow from the operations of its subsidiaries  particularly the operations of mecar 
capital resources 
allied spent in on capital equipment as compared with in and in  respectively 
the expenditures in were primarily for facility upgrades and computer equipment 
management currently anticipates that it will spend approximately on capital expenditures in for additional upgrades to the mecar and vsk group facilities and equipment 
results of operations 
allied had revenues from continuing operations of in as compared to in and in  respectively 
allied incurred a loss of from continuing operations in compared to profits of in and in the following table sets forth  for the years ended december   and  certain items from allied s consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue revenue costs and expenses cost of sales selling and administrative research and development restructuring costs operating loss income other income deductions interest income interest expense other net loss earnings before discontinued operation and income taxes income tax benefit expense loss earnings from continuing operations discontinued operation net loss earnings the following discussion of the components of the results of operations applies to allied as a whole unless reference is made to a particular segment 
revenues allied revenues from continuing operations for decreased  or  from revenues 
revenues from continuing operations for increased or  as compared to revenues by segment millions amount amount amount mecar vsk mecar s revenues for were only of its revenues in and its revenues were approximately greater than revenues 
in  revenues at the vsk group decreased approximately from levels if currency fluctuations are eliminated  vsk group revenues were essentially the same as revenues 
in  revenues at the vsk group increased approximately over revenues 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for was approximately compared with for each of and the increased cost of sales was primarily attributable to the rework of product performed at mecar 
selling and administrative expenses selling and general administrative expenses in were or greater than those incurred in principally as a result of costs incurred in the proxy solicitation contest 
selling and general administrative expenses in were or less than those incurred in research and development research and development costs incurred in increased by or over levels 
research and development costs incurred in increased by or over levels 
restructuring costs restructuring costs incurred by mecar in were principally comprised of workforce reductions 
such charges were incurred to reduce employment levels at mecar 
interest income interest income decreased in by  or  from levels  principally due to decreased amounts of cash invested 
interest income increased in by  or  over levels  principally due to increased cash 
interest expense interest expense decreased in by  or  compared to the amount incurred in  as a result of a decrease in the amount of bank fees paid by mecar  in part since the fms contracts received by mecar in did not require performance bonds or advance payment letters of credit 
interest expense decreased in by  or  compared to the amount incurred in  as a result of a decrease in bank debt 
other net other net results were a gain in and a loss in  largely due to net currency gains and losses  respectively  at mecar and vsk group 
other net results in decreased by compared to the amount incurred in as a result of net currency losses 
pre tax profit loss from continuing operations pre tax profit loss by segment million mecar vsk corporate and other mecar s loss resulted from insufficient revenue and unanticipated costs to rework products for certain customers 
mecar s pre tax profit decreased by from levels notwithstanding that pre tax profits were adversely affected by approximately in workforce reduction restructuring costs 
mecar s results for were enhanced by a substantial systems integration contract  which contracts typically provide higher profit margins than traditional contracts 
the vsk group s pre tax profit decreased slightly from levels as a result of exchange rate fluctuations 
the vsk group s pre tax profit increased by from its pre tax profit principally due to substantial growth in vsk group revenue in income taxes the company reported a tax benefit relating to continuing operations in principally as a result of the deferred tax benefits of tax loss carryforwards attributable to mecar s operating losses  less belgium taxes attributable to the vsk group s operations  an intercompany dividend and domestic tax expenses 
the effective tax rate was  primarily due to the utilization of tax loss carryforwards at mecar and the reduction of in deferred and accrued tax obligations in the united kingdom that were favorably resolved in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the utilization of tax loss carryforwards at mecar 
net earnings loss from continuing operations the company had a loss in from continuing operations compared with a profit in the company had a profit in from continuing operations compared with a profit in discontinued operation all results from the discontinued operation reported by allied relate to the operations of bri and have been reported net of income tax expense benefits 
the company s loss from the discontinued operation of is comprised of bri s operating loss  less related taxes 
bri reported net income of  net of taxes  in each of and impact of year the year yk issue arose out of the fact that many computer programs were written using two digits to identify the applicable year rather than four digits 
it was feared that computer programs with date sensitive software or equipment with embedded date sensitive technology might misinterpret a two digit code  for example   entered in a date field for the year  might be wrongly interpreted as the year this error could result in system or equipment failures or miscalculations and disruptions of operations 
during the last several years  allied has spent approximately to address issues related to the yk problem 
such amounts were funded by cash flow from operations  and did not have a material adverse effect on allied 
as of december   allied has completed all aspects of its yk readiness program and  through february   the corporation has not experienced any significant problems related to the yk issue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
allied manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
at year end  allied had approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness and approximately million of variable rate indebtedness 
allied has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness 
cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds  which generally mature in days or money market funds 
in general  such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the carrying amounts approximate market value 
it is the company s practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end variable rate debt and cash available for investment  a one percent change in interest rates would impact net interest income by less than  exchange rate sensitivity 
allied maintains operations in several foreign countries 
virtually all of the company s revenue from continuing operations was derived from allied s operations outside the united states 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movement in foreign currency rates 
allied uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates associated with some  but not all  of its contracts in which the expenses for providing services are incurred in currency other than the functional currency of allied s foreign subsidiaries or payments on contracts are made by the customer in another currency 
the objective of these contracts is to hedge fixed obligations to reduce the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on allied s foreign subsidiaries operating results 
additionally  allied s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the allied subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
allied does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating results by less than  allied does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor does allied hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
allied regularly reviews its hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging program
