industry trends the industry appears to be well into its growth cycle 
industry analyst are forecasting percent growth in calendar followed by percent expected growth in for global semiconductor sales 
over the past year  a number of semiconductor manufacturers have increased their equipment spending to add capacity  thus supporting a significant part of the growth in the industry 
according to dataquest  an industry market research firm  july equipment spending is forecast to increase in calendar  followed by expected growth of percent 
the asia pacific region has experienced the most growth  as foundries are adding capacity very quickly to meet demand 
this capacity shortfall exists because semiconductor manufacturers made very little equipment investments during the most recent downturn 
dataquest s july forecast estimates that  in calendar  of total industry equipment sales  asia pacific will spend while the us will spend 
in august  the north american semiconductor equipment companies recorded for the first time in industry history  order levels of approximately billion 
this order level is up from august also  by august  the north american equipment industry had experienced consecutive months of year over year booking growth 
by comparison  the last major build cycle of to experienced consecutive months of year over year order growth 
with a strong integrated circuit forecast predicted into and continued health in end user markets  industry booking rates should continue to be strong 
of the market segments that fsi participates in  dataquest s july forecast estimates market growth as follows photoresist processing surface conditioning spin on low k dielectric this forecast is based on factors such as shrinks  capacity additions and new fabs  acceptance of new materials such as copper and low k dielectrics  and funding of mm programs 
another factor receiving attention within the industry is the issue of reducing chemical consumption to lessen environmental impact 
both industry trade groups and equipment manufactures are seeking the best way to address these environmental concerns 
fsi anticipates many challenges as industry conditions continue to change with mm wafer fabs coming to fruition  growth concentrating in asia  and the demand for integrated processes from its customers continuing to increase 
results of operations in fiscal  fsi s revenue nearly doubled with revenue increasing over fiscal the significant increase in revenues is a result of capacity expansions by our customers due largely to increased device demand 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  fsi announced the infrastructure realignment program closing its mountain view and fremont  california facilities and the discontinuance of production of the nickel iron plating product 
fsi recorded realignment charges of approximately million consisting of approximately million of cost of goods sold  million of selling  general and administrative expenses and million of research and development expenses 
in addition  in the first quarter of fiscal  fsi recorded a million in process research and development write off related to the acquisition of yieldup and a gain of million related to the sale of  shares of its metron shares 
fiscal was a difficult year as fsi saw its revenue decrease from fiscal in anticipation of lower revenue  fsi implemented cost reduction measures in october  including an involuntary reduction in force  scheduled plant shutdowns and the delay or cancellation of certain programs 
in addition  during the third quarter of  fsi recorded a valuation allowance of million against its deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  fsi incurred million of charges relating to the realignment of its business due to industry conditions and the length of the industry downturn 
these charges were the result of the reduction in force and related severance costs  additional inventory reserves due to the discontinuation or phasing out of certain product lines  increased allowance for doubtful accounts for customers who previously purchased products which may be impacted by the realignment and charges related to the consolidation of facilities 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  certain income and expense items as a percent of total sales percent of sales fiscal years ended sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative in process research and development write off research and development operating loss other income  net loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense equity in earnings losses of affiliates net loss from continuing operations discontinued operations net loss from discontinued operations loss gain on sale of net assets of discontinued operations net loss sales sales increased to million for the fiscal year ended august  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended august  both the microlithography and surface conditioning divisions experienced sales increases  with the surface conditioning division having the most significant increase 
the overall sales increase is primarily due to the semiconductor manufacturers increased capital spending as they add capacity to meet customer demand  as well as a broadening customer base and market penetration in asia 
sales decreased to million for the fiscal year ended august  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended august  the decrease in sales occurred in both the microlithography and surface conditioning product lines 
the overall decrease in sales is the result of limited capital expenditures by fsi s customers due to fewer new fabs being constructed and equipped  and a limited number of fab expansions 
international sales were million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively  and represented approximately  and of sales during these periods 
international sales are primarily through fsi s affiliates  metron and m fsi  and represented approximately  and of international sales during fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in international sales in fiscal occurred in all international markets  particularly europe and asia 
both divisions experienced an increase in international sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to its broader customer base  the surface conditioning division has a higher percentage of international sales than the microlithography division 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s international sales 
fsi ended the fiscal year with a record backlog of approximately million as compared to million at the end of fiscal backlog consists of orders with delivery dates within the next months for which a customer purchase order has been received or a customer purchase order number has been communicated in writing to fsi 
because of the timing and relative size of orders and the possibility of cancellations or customer delays  backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for future periods 
our book to bill ratio for fiscal was  which was above the industry average for the same period 
orders for the last two quarters of fiscal exceeded million per quarter 
fsi expects orders for the first quarter of fiscal to be below this level 
based upon current backlog  anticipated orders  and delivery schedules  fsi expects fiscal sales to be considerably above the fiscal level 
however  due to customer delivery schedules  first quarter of fiscal is expected to be relatively flat as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  but significantly higher than the first quarter of fiscal fiscal annual sales are expected to exceed million 
gross profit gross profit  as a percentage of sales for fiscal  was as compared to for fiscal the improvement in gross margins for fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to higher manufacturing capacity utilization  a stronger mix of higher margin products increased service revenue and cost reduction efforts 
the improvement in margin was offset by the higher level of foreign sales  which sales generally have lower margins and also due to increased oem content in our products 
fiscal margin was impacted by approximately million of reduction in margin related to sales of yieldup finished goods inventory which was marked up to fair market value at the time of the closing of the yieldup acquisition 
we began recognizing full margins on yieldup product sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal gross margin was also impacted by inventory reserves  severance and outplacement costs of approximately million related to the infrastructure realignment recorded in the fourth quarter 
gross profit  as a percentage of sales for fiscal  was as compared to approximately for fiscal the decrease in gross margins for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to fixed excess manufacturing capacity related costs spread over a lower sales level 
gross profit margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal was significantly reduced due to approximately million of additional inventory reserves and severance and outplacement costs associated with a reduction in force 
due to the industry conditions and fsi s realignment  both divisions reviewed their phase out plans and discontinued products 
as a result  the divisions increased their inventory reserves 
the increase in inventory reserves  net for and were  and million  respectively 
the larger amount in was due to the continued downturn in the industry 
as the industry conditions started to improve in late fiscal and during fiscal  the company has not significantly increased inventory reserves 
during fiscal  the company disposed of million of inventory and increased inventory reserves by million 
fsi s gross profit margin may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the mix of products sold as some products have higher margins than others  the proportion of international sales as international sales generally have lower margins  competitive pricing pressures and utilization of manufacturing capacity 
based on the expected increase in sales volume and if fsi is successful with its product cost reduction programs  it is anticipated that gross margins will approach by the fourth quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal were million or of sales  as compared to million or of sales in fiscal and million or of sales in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percent of sales is due to higher revenue levels and the company s emphasis on cost controls 
the dollar amount increase is due to realignment costs of million  increased depreciation related to the new business system and the amortization of the intangible assets from the yieldup acquisition 
the realignment costs of million included million write off of the yieldup assembled workforce intangible  million of severance accruals and million of fixed asset and lease write offs 
the dollar increase in sg a for fiscal as compared to is also due to increased commissions  incentive compensation and customer service costs as a result of higher sales levels 
the decrease in sg a expenses in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is due to the overall reduction in force and also due to approximately million of realignment charges and other one time charges in the million of charges consists of million of costs associated with organizational changes announced in december and the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit  million of costs associated with facilities consolidation   of costs associated with increased allowance for doubtful accounts and  of severance costs and outplacement fees related to the reduction in force 
fsi expects the amount of sg a expenses as a percent of sales to decrease in fiscal to a range of to due to anticipated higher levels of revenues and various cost containment programs 
also  fsi will continue investments to expand worldwide sales and support capabilities 
fsi expects the dollar amount of sg a expenses to slightly increase in the first quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal excluding the realignment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of the dollar amount of sg a expenses for fiscal are expected to increase as compared to fiscal primarily due to anticipated increases in incentive programs and in customer service costs related to higher sales 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses for fiscal were million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal and million  or of sales  for fiscal the dollar amount increase for r d in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to product development on the mm products  the calypso tm spin on dielectric product and other new applications 
fiscal r d also included million of realignment charges related to the million write off of the yieldup assembled workforce intangible  million of severance costs and million of fixed asset write offs 
fsi incurred an in process r d write off of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal related to the yieldup acquisition 
as part of the acquisition  the company acquired projects under development  including the yieldup program 
the program is based on core technology that integrates multiple gas based cleaning capabilities  while also providing for the use of existing liquid based chemical sequencing 
in addition  the program is being designed from the ground up as a modular  multi tank cleaning solution designed to replace conventional wet benches for mm applications 
yieldup initiated development of the program in the fourth quarter of yieldup had spent approximately person years of effort to date in the development of the program 
at the time of the acquisition yieldup estimated that it would require an additional person years of effort to get the program to technological feasibility 
at the time of acquisition  the program was expected to reach a beta version at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal however  due to increased demand of the company s other products  the project was delayed 
the program is expected to reach a beta version by the fourth quarter of the company expects to spend another million by the end of fourth quarter to complete the technology 
in process research and development was valued by discounting forecasted cash flow directly related to the products expected to result from the subject research and development 
in each instance where a developed  core technology is expected to be leveraged  a charge for core technology was deducted from the forecast to provide a fair return on the leveraged technology 
the assumed charge for core technology is of revenues on an after tax basis 
to estimate the fair value of the in process research and development assets  a discount rate of was employed  developed by analyzing the project and market risks associated with the research and development effort  both in terms of costs invested as of the valuation date relative to completion costs and technical achievements 
this discount rate represents a significant premium above the discount rate utilized in the valuation of existing product technology to account for the additional risks associated with in process product technologies 
fsi developed a calculation of the value of in process research and development assets that excludes cash flows attributable to remaining development efforts required to develop the acquired incomplete technology into commercially viable products 
the calculation of excluded cash flow was determined by evaluating the costs  development time  and technological complexity required to develop the in process technology into commercially viable products 
at the time of the acquisition  fsi management s estimate was that in process technology was complete  and the value of the in process research and development assets as of the valuation date was estimated at million 
the program represents a high risk in process technology asset since the program is based on an entirely new platform from fsi s current products 
certain technology developed by yieldup for the program is revolutionary as the program represents fsi s first attempt to integrate both multiple gas based cleaning technologies and gas based drying technology within a modular mm configuration design with a low cost of ownership 
some of this technical risk is moderated by the project s later stage of development 
market research indicates that there could be significant demand for a fully integrated wafer cleaning solution  such as the program 
however  fsi is a new entrant in the wet bench market and may face significant competition from more established players 
therefore  an unusual charge of approximately million is reflected in the income statement of fsi in the first quarter of due to the immediate write off of in process research and development 
at the effective date  the technological feasibility of the acquired technology had not been established and the technology had no alternative uses 
fsi s average investment on new product and process development programs as a percent of total revenues has been for the past three years 
fsi expects r d expense as a percentage of sales to decrease in fiscal to a range of to as compared to however  the dollar amount in fiscal is expected to increase from the fiscal level 
fsi will continue to remain focused on critical technologies and strategically invest its r d dollars  specifically in the immersion technology for surface conditioning products  the calypso tm the spin on dielectric product  and mm products for both resist processing and surface conditioning 
fsi expects r d expenses to increase in the first quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of during fiscal years  and  fsi recognized approximately   and  respectively  of third party funding as reductions in research and development expenses 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was approximately million of income  or of sales  for fiscal as compared to  of income  or of sales  for fiscal and million of income  or of sales for fiscal the increase in amounts for fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to the million gain recognized on the sale of approximately  shares of metron technology s our affiliate stock in its initial public offering during the first quarter 
additionally  the increase in fiscal is due to reduced interest expense as a result of the debt repayment offset by reduced interest income due to lower cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities amounts 
the overall change for fiscal as compared to is due to an additional expense of approximately  associated with the make whole penalties related to the repayment of certain senior unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature through interest expense is expected to be minimal for fsi in fiscal year interest income is expected to be  to  during the first quarter of fiscal  depending upon the level of investments and the interest rates 
it is anticipated that quarterly interest income will increase during fiscal if the company generates cash flow from operations as expected 
income tax benefit expense the company had no tax benefit or expense during fiscal year as a result of its recent losses 
the tax expense related to continuing operations for fiscal was million of expense as compared to a million of tax benefit for the comparable period 
during the third quarter of  fsi recorded a valuation allowance of million against its deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance was recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 primarily due to fsi s continued losses 
fsi does not expect to record any tax benefit or expense in the future until the company is consistently profitable on a quarterly basis 
fsi s deferred tax assets on the balance sheet as of august  have been fully reserved with a valuation allowance 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates equity in earnings losses of affiliates was approximately million of income for fiscal  million of losses for fiscal and  of income for fiscal the income in fiscal is due to improved operations at both affiliates 
the loss in fiscal as compared to the income in is due to losses or lower earnings at both affiliates  metron technology nv and m fsi  ltd 
fsi is expecting continued improvement in financial performance for both affiliates in fiscal with equity in earnings of affiliates to range from  to million each quarter 
liquidity and capital resources fsi s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately million as of august   a decrease of million from the end of fiscal the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities is due to approximately million in cash flow used to fund operations and approximately million used to repay long term debt 
in addition  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company made million in payments to yieldup shareholders as part of the acquisition consideration and received cash proceeds of million from the sale of metron technology stock 
accounts receivable increased million from the end of fiscal including an increase in accounts receivable from affiliates of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to the increase in sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal and the higher mix of foreign sales as the collection period is generally longer for foreign accounts receivable 
inventory increased approximately million to million at the end of fiscal  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the increase in inventory was primarily in work in process and raw materials as we purchased materials to support the higher order activity 
as of august   fsi s current ratio was to and working capital was million 
acquisitions of property  plant and equipment were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
fsi expects capital expenditures to be between and million in fiscal depreciation and amortization for fiscal is expected to be approximately million 
on september   fsi completed the repayment of its senior unsecured notes 
the notes consisted of million of senior unsecured notes due to mature in which were paid off in september and million of senior unsecured notes due to mature in which were paid off prior to fiscal year end 
at the time of the prepayment  certain lenders had claimed that fsi was in default under certain covenants contained in the note agreements 
these claims were waived in connection with the repayment 
fsi s long term debt  including current maturities  remaining after the pay off of its unsecured notes is approximately  related to capital leases 
fsi believes that with existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and internally generated funds  there will be sufficient funds to meet fsi s currently projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least mid fiscal 
fsi believes that success in its industry requires substantial capital to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
one of fsi s strategic objectives is  as market and business conditions warrant  consider divestitures  investments or acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies particularly those that are complementary to our surface conditioning business 
fsi may affect additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to fsi s shareholders 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes appropriate accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
must be adopted for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  fsi will adopt sfas no 
in fiscal the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on fsi s financial statements although  equity in earnings of affiliates may be more volatile due to their international operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements of all public registrants 
the company is evaluating various practical implementation considerations 
changes in our revenue recognition policy resulting from the interpretation of sab  to the extent applicable  would be effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal management believes that sab  to the extent applicable to us  will not affect the underlying strength or weakness of our business operations as measured by the dollar value of our product shipments and cash flows 
risk factors due to the nature of business and the industry in which we operate the following risk factors should be considered in addition to others described above 
our business faces significant risks 
these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
because our business depends on the amount that manufacturers of microelectronics spend on capital equipment  downturns in the microelectronics industry may adversely affect our results 
the microelectronics industry experiences periodic slowdowns  which may have a negative effect on our sales and operating results 
our business depends on the amount that manufacturers of microelectronics spend on capital equipment 
the amount they spend on capital equipment depends on the existing and expected demand for semiconductor devices and products that use semiconductor devices 
the microelectronics industry has experienced alternating upturns and downturns in business activity 
when this occurs  some semiconductor manufacturers experience lower demand and increased pricing pressure for their products 
as a result  they are likely to purchase less semiconductor processing equipment and have sometimes delayed making decisions to purchase capital equipment 
in some cases  semiconductor manufacturers have cancelled or delayed orders for our products 
if we do not continue to develop new products  we will not be able to compete effectively 
our business and results of operations could decline if we do not develop and successfully introduce new or improved products that the market accepts 
the technology used in microelectronics manufacturing equipment and processes changes rapidly 
industry standards change constantly and equipment manufacturers frequently introduce new products 
we believe that microelectronics manufacturers increasingly rely on equipment manufacturers like us to design and develop more efficient manufacturing equipment design and implement improved processes for microelectronics manufacturers to use make their equipment compatible with equipment made by other equipment manufacturers to compete  we must continue to develop  manufacture  and market new or improved products that meet changing industry standards 
to do this successfully  we must select appropriate products design and develop our products efficiently and quickly implement our manufacturing and assembly processes efficiently and on time make products that perform well for our customers market and sell our products effectively  and introduce our new products in a way that does not reduce sales of our existing products future acquisitions may dilute our stockholders ownership interests and have other adverse consequences 
because of consolidations in the semiconductor equipment industry served by us and other competitive factors  our management will seek to acquire additional product lines  technologies  and businesses if suitable opportunities develop 
acquisitions may result in the issuance of our stock  which may dilute our stockholders ownership interests and reduce earnings per share 
acquisitions may also increase debt levels and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in absorbing the new business  product line  or technology diversion of management s attention from other business concerns entering new markets in which we have little or no experience possible loss of key employees of the acquired business because of the volatility of our stock price  the ability to trade fsi shares may be adversely affected and our ability to raise capital through future equity financing may be reduced 
the price of our stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be so in the future 
in the fiscal year  for example  our stock price ranged from to per share 
the trading price of our common shares is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including factors discussed elsewhere in this report and the following failure to meet the published expectations of securities analysts for a given quarterly period changes in financial estimates by securities analysts press releases or announcements by or changes in market values of comparable companies stock market price and volume fluctuations  which is particularly common among securities of high technology companies stock market price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels additions or departures of key personnel  and involvement in litigation the prices of technology stocks  including ours  have been particularly affected by extreme fluctuations in price and volume in the stock market generally 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies whose stock is traded 
these broad stock market fluctuations may have a negative effect on our future stock price 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
to date we have not been subject to such claims  however we may in the future be the target of this type of litigation 
securities litigation may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which can seriously harm our business 
because our quarterly operating results are volatile  our stock price could decrease 
in the past  our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations may have a significant impact on our stock price 
the reasons for the fluctuations in our operating results  such as sales  gross profits  and net income  include the timing of significant customer orders and customer spending patterns 
during industry downturns  our customers may ask us to delay or even cancel the shipment of previously firm orders 
delays and cancellations may adversely affect our operating results in any particular quarter if we are unable to recognize revenue for particular sales in the quarter in which those sales were expected 
the timing of new product and service announcements by us or our competitors 
new product announcements by us and our competitors could cause our customers to delay a purchase or to decide to purchase products of one of our competitors which would adversely affect our revenue and  therefore  our results of operations 
new product announcements by others may make it necessary for us to reduce prices on our products or offer more service options  which could adversely impact operating margins and net income 
the mix of products sold and the market acceptance of our new product lines 
the mix of products we sell varies from period to period  and because margins vary among or within different product lines  this can adversely affect our results of operations 
if we fail to sell our products which generate higher margins  our average gross margins may be lower than expected 
if we fail to sell our new product lines  our revenue may be lower than expected 
general global economic conditions or economic conditions in a particular region 
when economic conditions in a region or worldwide worsen  customers may delay or cancel their orders 
there may also be an increase in the time it takes to collect from our customers or even outright defaults in payments 
this can negatively affect our cash flow and our results 
as a result of the factors listed above  our future operating results are difficult to predict 
further  we base our current and future expense plans in significant part on our expectations of our longer term future revenue 
as a result  we expect our expense levels to be relatively fixed in the short run 
an unanticipated decline in revenue for a particular quarter may disproportionately affect our net income in that quarter 
if our revenue is below our projections  then our operating results will also be below expectations and  as we have in the past  we may even have losses in the short run 
any one of the factors listed above  or a combination thereof  could adversely affect our quarterly results of operations  and consequently may cause a decline in our share price 
because international sales are important to us  and because most of our international sales are through our affiliated distributors  reductions in the sales efforts of these affiliates could adversely affect our results 
the profits or losses of our affiliated distributors  metron technology bv and m fsi ltd  can also significantly affect our financial results 
we make most of our international sales through these affiliated distributors 
as of august  we have a ownership interest in metron and a interest in m fsi 
fiscal sales through m fsi were million or of our total sales 
fiscal sales through metron were million or of our total sales 
in addition  these affiliates also provide service and support to many of our international customers 
metron and m fsi also distribute or sell products for companies other than us 
it could have a negative effect on our operating results if either of these affiliates reduced its sales efforts  lost the business of a significant company for which it distributes or sells products  lost a significant customer  or otherwise became less financially viable 
we cannot guarantee that metron or m fsi will continue to successfully distribute our products or the products of other companies 
the failure of metron or m fsi to do so could have a significant negative effect on our results of operations 
changes in demand caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may reduce our international sales 
almost all of our direct international sales are denominated in us dollars 
nonetheless  changes in demand caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may affect our international sales 
most of our international sales  however  are through our affiliated distributors 
metron s sales of our products and other companies products are primarily denominated in us dollars  but its expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may affect metron s financial results 
sales for m fsi are denominated in yen 
as a result  us dollar yen exchange rates may affect our equity interest in m fsi s earnings 
metron and m fsi sometimes engage in so called hedging or risk reducing transactions to try to limit the negative effects that the devaluation of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could have on operating results 
they will do so if a sale denominated in a foreign currency is sufficiently large to justify the costs of hedging 
to hedge a sale  metron or m fsi will typically commit to buy us dollars and sell the foreign currency at a given price at a future date 
if the customer cancels the sale  metron or m fsi may be forced to buy us dollars and sell the foreign currency at market rates to meet its hedging obligations and may incur a loss in doing so 
to date  the hedging activities of metron and m fsi have not had any significant negative effect on us 
the adoption of sfas by metron and m fsi may cause more volatility in our equity in earnings of affiliates 
because of the need to meet and comply with numerous foreign regulations and policies  the changeability of the political and economic environments in foreign jurisdictions and the difficulty of managing business overseas  we may not be able to sustain our historical level of international sales 
we and our affiliates operate in a global market 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales revenue derived from sales outside the united states 
in fiscal  this figure was  and in fiscal it was 
these figures include sales through metron and m fsi  which accounted for of international sales in  in and in we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of total sales 
sales to customers outside the united states involve a number of risks  including the following imposition of government controls compliance with us export laws and foreign laws political and economic instability trade restrictions changes in taxes and tariffs longer payment cycles difficulty of administering business overseas  and general economic conditions in particular  the japanese and asia pacific markets are extremely competitive 
the semiconductor device manufacturers located there are very aggressive in seeking price concessions from suppliers  including equipment manufacturers like us 
in fiscal  approximately of our international sales were attributable to these markets 
we seek to meet technical standards imposed by foreign regulatory bodies 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with those standards in the future 
any failure by us to design products to comply with foreign standards could have a significant negative impact on us 
because of the significant financial resources needed to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support and to invest in research and development  we may be unable to compete with larger  better established competitors 
the microelectronics equipment industry is highly competitive 
we face substantial competition throughout the world 
we believe that to remain competitive  we will need significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support  and to invest in research and development 
we believe that the microelectronics industry is becoming increasingly dominated by large manufacturers who have the resources to support customers on a worldwide basis 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  and customer support capabilities than us 
large equipment manufacturers may enter the market areas in which we compete 
in addition  smaller  emerging microelectronics equipment companies provide innovative technology 
we expect that our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and processes 
we also expect them to introduce new products and processes with better performance and pricing 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to compete effectively in the united states or elsewhere 
because we do not have long term sales commitments with our customers  if these customers decide to reduce  delay or cancel orders or choose to deal with our competitors  then our results will be adversely affected 
if our significant customers  including ibm  texas instruments  stmicroelectronics  st silicon or seagate technology  reduce  delay  or cancel orders  then our operating results could suffer 
our largest customers have changed from year to year 
sales to fsi s top five customers accounted for approximately  and of total sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
stmicroelectronics represented of revenues in fiscal texas instruments accounted for of revenues in fiscal and of revenues during fiscal ibm accounted for of revenues during fiscal and of revenues during fiscal national semiconductor accounted for of revenues in fiscal we currently have no long term sales commitments with any of our customers 
instead  we generally make sales under purchase orders 
our backlog at august  was million of which was comprised of orders from three customers 
as of august  we had received approximately million in orders from two customers that are scheduled to ship in fiscal and all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer 
because we retained certain liabilities from the divestiture of the chemical management division or agreed to indemnify boc with respect to specified obligations and liabilities  we may experience charges in excess of the reserves established at the time of the divestiture which could negatively impact results from operations 
in connection with the divestiture of the chemical management division  we retained certain liabilities and agreed to indemnify boc with respect to certain specified obligations and liabilities 
during the first quarter of  fsi continued to negotiate the final closing balance sheet for the cmd divestiture to boc 
upon the completion of those negotiations  fsi established an additional  accrual for expected costs associated with completing two projects that were in process when boc purchased the division 
during the second quarter  the parties settled on a final closing balance sheet and no additional reserves were recorded 
if we experience liabilities or charges in excess of established reserves and it is ultimately determined that an adjustment in favor of boc is warranted  our results of operations could be adversely impacted due to additional costs associated with those reserves or the request to return to boc a portion of the purchase price because of such adjustments 
it may be difficult for us to compete with stronger competitors resulting from industry consolidation 
in the past several years  we have seen a trend toward consolidation in the microelectronics equipment industry we expect the trend toward consolidation to continue as companies seek to strengthen or maintain their market positions in a rapidly changing industry 
we believe that industry consolidations may result in competitors that are better able to compete 
this could have a significant negative impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition because we depend upon our management and technical personnel for our success  the loss of key personnel could place us at a competitive disadvantage 
our success depends to a significant extent upon our management and technical personnel 
the loss of a number of these key persons could have a negative effect on our operations 
competition is high for such personnel in our industry in all locations 
we periodically review our compensation and benefit packages to ensure that they are competitive in the marketplace and make adjustments or implement new programs for that purpose  as appropriate 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we require to continue to grow and operate profitably 
our employment costs in the short term are to a large extent fixed  and therefore any unexpected revenue shortfall could adversely affect our operating results 
our operating expense levels are based in significant part on our head count  which is generally driven by longer term revenue goals 
for a variety of reasons  particularly the high cost and disruption of lay offs and the costs of recruiting and training  our head count in the short term is  to a large extent  fixed 
accordingly  we may be unable to reduce employment costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue or gross margin shortfall  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
because our intellectual property is important to our success  the loss or diminution of our intellectual property rights through legal challenge by others or from independent development by others  could adversely affect our business 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  copyrights  trade secrets  and other measures 
however  we believe that our financial performance will depend more upon the innovation  technological expertise  and marketing abilities of our employees than on such protection 
in connection with our intellectual property rights  we face the following risks our pending patent applications may not be issued or may be issued with more narrow claims patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented rights granted under issued patents may not provide competitive advantages to us foreign laws may not protect our intellectual property rights others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products  or design around our patents as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we occasionally receive notices from others alleging infringement claims 
we have been involved in patent infringement litigation in the past and scd mountain view is currently involved in such litigation 
we could become involved in similar lawsuits or other patent infringement claims in the future 
we cannot guarantee the outcome of such lawsuits or claims  which may have a significant negative effect on our business or operating results 
our sales cycle is long and unpredictable  which could require us to incur high sales and marketing expenses with no assurance that a sale will result 
sales cycles for some of our products can run as long as to months 
as a result  we may not recognize revenue from efforts to sell particular products for extended periods of time 
we believe that the length of the sales cycle may increase as some current and potential customers centralize purchasing decisions into one decision making entity 
we expect this may intensify the evaluation process and require us to make additional sales and marketing expenditures with no assurance that a sale will result 
we do not intend to pay dividends 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and  therefore  do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
adoption of the common european currency may adversely affect us and our affiliated distributors by requiring systems modifications and possibly increasing their currency exchange risks 
we are in the process of analyzing the issues raised by the introduction of the common european currency unit  the euro 
the use of the euro began on january  and will be phased in through january  we do not expect the cost of any necessary systems modification to be material and do not anticipate that the introduction and use of the euro will materially affect our results or those of our affiliated distributors international business operations 
nor do we expect the euro to have a material effect on the currency exchange risks of our or our affiliated distributors businesses 
our management will continue to monitor the effect of the implementation of the euro
