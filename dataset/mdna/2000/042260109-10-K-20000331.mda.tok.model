new accounting pronouncements beginning in the first quarter of  we adopted statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
the adoption of this statement did not materially impact our consolidated results  financial condition or long term liquidity 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounts standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas 
comprehensive income includes net income and several other items that current accounting standards require to be recognized outside of net income 
this standard requires enterprises to display comprehensive income and its components in financial statements  to classify items of comprehensive income by their nature in financial statements  and to display the accumulated balances of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital 
sfas was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this standard for our fiscal year beginning december  in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
summarizes the sec staff s view in applying generally accepted accounting principles to the recognition of revenues 
the company has evaluated the impact of the reporting requirements of sab no 
and has determined that there will be no material impact on its consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our revenue or profitability 
historically  we have been able to offset any inflationary effects by either increasing prices or improving cost efficiencies 
year activities as described in the form q for the quarter ended september   we had developed plans to address our potential exposures to our systems related to the year since entering the year  we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business nor are we aware of any significant year related disruptions impacting our customers and suppliers 
we will continue to monitor our systems and operations until we are reasonably assured that no significant business interruptions will occur as a result of any year issues 
we spent a total of approximately  on the year project with no significant additional expenses expected in forward looking statements we believe that it is important to communicate our expectations to our investors 
accordingly  this report contains discussion of events or results that have not yet occurred or been realized 
you can identify this type of discussion  which is often termed forward looking statements  by such words and phrases as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates and could be 
execution of acquisition strategies  expansion of product lines and increase of distribution networks or product sales are are as  among others  whose future success may be difficult to predict 
you should read forward looking statements carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position  or state other expectations of future performance 
the actions of current and potential new competitors  changes in technology  seasonality  business cycles and new regulatory requirements are factors that impact greatly upon strategies and expectations and are outside our direct control 
there may be events in the future that we are not able accurately to predict or to control 
any cautionary language in this report provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ from the expectations we express in our forward looking statements 
before you invest in our common stock  you should be aware that the occurrence of certain of the events described in this report could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financial activities  is exposed to changes in raw material prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company manages exposures to changes in raw material prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through its regular operating and financing activities 
the company does not utilize financial instruments or leveraged financial instrument for trading or other speculative purposes 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its investments in short term investments as the company currently has no short or long term borrowings outstanding 
there is inherent roll over risk for marketable securities as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
however  there is no risk of loss of principal  only a risk related to potential reduction in future interest income 
derivative instruments are not presently used to adjust the company s interest rate risk profile 
the majority of the company s business is denominated in us dollars 
there are costs related to the london headquarters which are denominated in the british currency 
several other currencies are used by the company for various transactions  but their effect on the total business is minimal 
by maintaining a sterling bank account  the company is able to eliminate any foreign currency exchange gains or losses arising under cash paid out in british currency 
risks associated with international operations the company does business in numerous countries  including emerging markets in africa  asia and south america 
the company has invested substantial resources outside of the united states and plans to continue to do so in the future 
the company s international operations are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  tariffs and trade barriers  potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and local economic  political and social conditions 
governments of many developing countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector 
government actions in the future could have a significant adverse effect on economic conditions in a developing country or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company and its operating companies 
the company does not have political risk insurance in the countries in which it currently conducts business  but does periodically analyze the need for and cost associated with this type of policy 
moreover  applicable agreements relating to the company s interests in its operating companies are frequently governed by foreign law 
as a result  in the event of a dispute  it may be difficult for the company to enforce its rights 
accordingly  the company may have little or no recourse upon the occurrence of any of these developments
