market risk the company is exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of derivative contracts 
as clearly stated in the company s policies and procedures  financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes  and under no circumstances are they used for speculating or for trading 
transactions are entered into only with banking institutions with strong credit ratings  and thus the credit risk associated with these contracts is considered immaterial 
hedging program results and status are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis 
the following section describes the company s risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analyses performed on december  the sensitivity tests assumed instantaneous  parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rate yield curves 
a 
foreign exchange rates due to its international business presence  the company transacts extensively in foreign currencies 
as a result  corporate earnings experience some volatility related to movements in exchange rates 
in order to exploit the benefits of global diversification and naturally offsetting currency positions  foreign exchange balance sheet exposures are aggregated and hedged at the corporate level through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts 
the objective of the foreign exchange hedging program is to reduce earnings volatility resulting from the translation of net foreign exchange balance sheet positions 
a hypothetical  instantaneous  percent adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates would decrease earnings by approximately million in the current reporting period 
the sensitivity analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on cummins competitive position as well as the remoteness of the likelihood that all foreign currencies will move in tandem against the us dollar 
the analysis also ignores the offsetting impact on income of the revaluation of the underlying balance sheet exposures 
b 
interest rates the company currently has in place three interest rate swaps that effectively convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt 
the objective of the swaps is to more efficiently balance borrowing costs and interest rate risk 
a sensitivity analysis assumed a hypothetical  instantaneous  basis point parallel increase in the floating interest rate yield curve  after which rates remained fixed at the new  higher level for a one year period 
this change in yield curve would correspond to a million increase in interest expense for the one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the company s competitive environment indirectly related to changes in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes 
c 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers 
given the historically volatile nature of commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
the company uses commodity swap agreements to partially hedge exposures to changes in copper and aluminum prices 
given a hypothetical  instantaneous percent depreciation of the underlying commodity price  with prices then remaining fixed for a month period  the company would experience a loss of approximately million for the annual reporting period 
this amount excludes the offsetting impact of decreases in commodity costs 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  other sections of this annual report and the company s press releases  teleconferences and other external communications contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the industries in which cummins operates and management s beliefs and assumptions 
words  such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions future factors which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
cummins undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
future factors include increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors  including new entrants  rapid technological developments and changes  the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products on a timely  cost effective basis  the mix of products  the achievement of lower costs and expenses  domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes  including environmental regulations  protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights  reliance on large customers  technological  implementation and cost financial risks in increasing use of large  multi year contracts  the cyclical nature of cummins business  the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings  and continued availability of financing  financial instruments and financial resources in the amounts  at the times and on the terms required to support cummins future business 
these are representative of the future factors that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements 
in addition  such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general domestic and international economic conditions  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations  and other future factors
