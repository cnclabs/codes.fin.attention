the company s actual results could differ materially from its historical results and from those set forth in the forward looking statements and may fluctuate between operating periods 
factors that might cause such differences and fluctuations include the following the company s ability to efficiently consolidate the operations of black bean studios inc  the company s ability to attract  train and retain qualified strategic  creative and technical personnel  the company s ability to retain its sales and consulting staffs  the company s ability to close sales  risks related to the management of growth  development and promotional expenses related to the introduction of new service offerings  changes in technology and industry standards  limited operating history  changes in the market for the company s services  the rate of acceptance of the company s services  dependence of the company s business on the internet  increased competition  changing of pricing policies by the company or its competitors  the timing of receipt of orders from major customers  development of internet and intranet products or enhancements by vendors of existing client server or legacy software systems that compete with the company s consulting services  dependence on key personnel  proprietary technology and the inherent difficulties in protecting intellectual property  dependence on third party technology  and exposure for product and professional services liability
