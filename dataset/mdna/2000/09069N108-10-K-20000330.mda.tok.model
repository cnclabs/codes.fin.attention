a rehabilitation under receivership  similar to a reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws  was approved by the chancery court the court of the state of tennessee  would allow xantus to remain operating as a tenncare mco  providing full health care related services to its enrollees 
under the plan  the state  among other things  agreed to loan to xantus approximately million to be used solely to repay pre petition claims of providers  which claims aggregate approximately million 
under the plan  the company received million  including million of unpaid rebates to xantus which the company was allowed to retain under the terms of the preliminary rehabilitation plan for xantus 
a plan for the payment of the remaining amounts has not been finalized and the recovery of any additional amounts is uncertain 
the company recorded a special charge of million for the estimated loss on the remaining amounts owed  net of the unpaid amounts to network pharmacies 
the company does not believe that the failure to collect such amounts will have a material adverse effect on the company s business or operations 
the company has been disputing several improper reductions of payments by thp and php 
these reductions relate to a supposed coordination of benefits issue raised by thp related to services provided in prior years and a dispute over items allowed to be billed in addition to the company s capitated rate under the contracts with thp and php 
the contracts with these organizations require the disputes be arbitrated 
while the company believes that it is owed these amounts from each of thp and php and intends to pursue vigorously its counterclaims  at this time  the company is unable to assess the likelihood that it will prevail

this compares with net income of million  or per share for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   the company recorded revenue of million  an increase of million over the prior year 
approximately million of the increase in revenues resulted from increased commercial business  including million from a nevada based managed care organization the nevada plans

costs attributable to the acquisition of continental accounted for million of the increase in cost of revenue 
costs related to tenncare contracts increased cost of revenue million 
costs relating to the two new tenncare contracts accounted for million of such increase  while increased enrollment in existing tenncare plans increased cost of revenue million

as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily as a result of contract renewals on more favorable terms 
generally  loss contracts arise only on capitated or other risk based contracts and primarily result from higher than expected pharmacy utilization rates  higher than expected inflation in drug costs and the inability to restrict formularies to the extent contemplated by the company at the time a contract is entered into  thereby resulting in higher than expected drug costs 
at such time as management estimates that a contract will sustain losses over its remaining contractual life  a reserve is established for these estimated losses 
after analyzing those factors described above  the company recorded a million reserve in december with respect to the nevada plans 
the arrangements with the nevada plans were terminated in august the reserve established was adequate to absorb the actual losses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december   an increase of million as compared to million for the year ended december  the acquisition of continental accounted for million of the increase 
the remaining million increase in expenses reflects expenditures incurred in connection with the company s continuing commitment to enhance its ability to manage efficiently pharmacy benefits by investing in additional operational and clinical personnel and information systems to support new and existing customers  partially offset by lower legal costs 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   as revenue increases did not result in proportional increases in expenditures 
the company recorded a non recurring charge against earnings of million in connection with its negotiated termination of its relationship with rxcare rxcare settlement

the continental acquisition resulted in the recording of approximately million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets  which will be amortized over their estimated useful lives years and years  respectively 
for the year ended december   the company recorded interest income  net of interest expense  of million

for the year ended december   the company recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  before recording the million and million non recurring charges for the rxcare settlement and tennessee settlement  respectively 
net income for the year ended december   after recording the non recurring charges  was million  or per diluted share 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a net loss of million or per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources the company utilizes both funds generated from operations  if any  and funds raised in the offering for capital expenditures and working capital needs 
for the year ended december   net cash provided to the company by operating activities totaled million primarily due to an increase in claims payable of million and an increase of payables to plan sponsors of million 
the increase in claims payable reflects an increase in the pbm business 
the increase in payables to plan sponsors and others is primarily a result of increased manufacturer s rebates  which are shared with certain clients under rebate sharing agreements 
receivables increased by million due to a higher percentage of fee for service contracts in investing activities generated million in cash from proceeds of maturities of investment securities of million  offset by the purchases of million 
this was further offset by the purchase of million in equipment 
a portion of these purchases was for upgrading computer software and hardware

health plans obligations under the facility are secured by a first priority security interest in all of health plans receivables as well as other related collateral 
health plans obligations under the facility are guaranteed by the company 
as the company continues to grow  it anticipates that its working capital needs will also continue to increase 
the company believes that it has sufficient cash on hand or available to fund the company s anticipated working capital and other cash needs for at least the next months 
from time to time  the company may be a party to legal proceedings or involved in related investigations  inquiries or discussions  in each case  arising in the ordinary course of the company s business 
although no assurance can be given  management does not presently believe that any current matters would have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  financial position or results of operations of the company 
at december   the company had  for tax purposes  unused net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million which will begin expiring in as it is uncertain whether the company will realize the full benefit from these carryforwards  the company has recorded a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset generated by the carryforwards 
the company assesses the need for a valuation allowance at each balance sheet date 
the company has undergone a change in control as defined by the internal revenue code of  as amended code  and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder 
the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be utilized in any given year will be subject to a limitation as a result of this change 
the annual limitation is approximately million 
actual utilization in any year will vary based on the company s tax position in that year 
the company also may pursue joint venture arrangements  business acquisitions and other transactions designed to expand its pbm  e commerce or specialty pharmacy businesses  which the company would expect to fund from cash on hand  the facility  other future indebtedness or  if appropriate  the sale or exchange of equity securities of the company 
other matters from january through december   the company provided a broad range of pbm services on behalf of rxcare  to the tenncare  tenncare partners and other commercial pbm clients under the rxcare contract 
a majority of the company s revenues have been derived from providing pbm services in the state of tennessee to mco s participating in the state of tennessee s tenncare program and bho s participating in the state of tennessee s tenncare partners program 
from january through december   the company provided its pbm services to the tenncare mco s as a subcontractor to rxcare 
the company and rxcare did not renew the rxcare contract which expired on december  the negotiated termination of its relationship with rxcare  among other things  allowed the company to directly market its services to tennessee customers including those then under contract with rxcare prior to the expiration of the rxcare contract 
the rxcare contract had previously prohibited the company from soliciting and or marketing its pbm services in tennessee other than on behalf of  and for the benefit of  rxcare 
the company s marketing efforts resulted in the company executing agreements with all of the mco s for the tenncare lives previously managed under the rxcare contract as well as substantially all tpas and employer groups previously managed under the rxcare contract 
on november   the governor of the state of tennessee announced a series of proposed reforms for the tenncare program the tenncare reforms  one of which was to have the state of tennessee assume responsibility for the provision of pharmacy benefits for tenncare recipients  effective july  in connection with that proposal  on december   the state of tennessee issued a request for proposal the rfp for the provision of such benefits 
the company was a recipient of the rfp and is in the process of responding to it 
the implementation of all or a portion of these proposed tenncare reforms requires both legislative and regulatory approval 
which reforms will actually be implemented and the timing thereof has not been determined 
the implementation of all or a portion of these reforms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operations and financial performance 
the failure of the company to be awarded the rfp would have a material adverse impact on the company s business and financial performance 
as a result of providing capitated pbm services to certain tenncare mco s  the company s pharmaceutical claims costs historically have been subject to significant increases from october through february  which the company believes is due to the need for increased medical attention to  and intervention with  mco s members during the colder months 
the resulting increase in pharmaceutical costs impacts the profitability of capitated contracts and other risk based arrangements 
risk based business represented approximately of the company s revenues while non risk business including mail order services represented approximately of the company s revenues for the years ended december  and non risk arrangements mitigate the adverse effect on profitability of higher pharmaceutical costs incurred under risk based contracts  as higher utilization positively impacts profitability under fee for service or non risk based arrangements 
the company presently anticipates that approximately of its revenues in fiscal will be derived from risk based arrangements 
changes in prices charged by manufacturers and wholesalers or distributors for pharmaceuticals  a component of pharmaceutical claims costs  directly affects the company s cost of revenue 
the company believes that it is likely that prices will continue to increase  which could have an adverse effect on the company s gross profit on risk based arrangements 
because plan sponsors are responsible for the payment of prescription costs in non risk based arrangements  the company s gross profit is not adversely affected by changes in pharmaceutical prices 
to the extent such cost increases adversely effect the company s gross profit  the company may be required to increase risk based contract rates on new contracts and upon renewal of existing risk based contracts 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining these rate increases 
the potential greater proportion of non risk contracts with the company s customers in compared to prior years mitigates the potential adverse effects of price increases  although no assurance can be given that the recent trend towards non risk arrangements will continue or that a substantial increase in drug costs or utilization would not negatively affect the company s overall profitability in any period 
generally  loss contracts arise only on capitated or other risk based contracts and primarily result from higher than expected pharmacy utilization rates  higher than expected inflation in drug costs and the inability of the company to restrict its mco clients formularies to the extent anticipated by the company at the time contracted pbm services are implemented  thereby resulting in higher than expected drug costs 
at such time as management estimates that a contract will sustain losses over its remaining contractual life  a reserve is established for these estimated losses 
there are currently no loss contracts and management does not believe that there is an overall trend towards losses on its existing capitated contracts 
year disclosure the so called year problem concerns the inability of information systems  primarily computer software programs  to recognize properly and process date sensitive information following december  the company committed substantial resources approximately million over the past three years to improve its information systems is project 
the company has used this is project as an opportunity to evaluate its state of readiness and identify and quantify risks associated with any potential year issues 
the company did not experience any material year problems and was not required to incur additional expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk represents the only market risk exposure applicable to the company 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investments in marketable securities 
all of these instruments are classified as held to maturity on the company s consolidated balance sheet and were entered into by the company solely for investment purposes and not for trading purposes 
the company does not invest in or otherwise use derivative financial instruments 
the company s investments consist primarily of corporate debt securities  corporate preferred stock and state and local governmental obligations  each rated aa or higher 
the table below presents principal cash flow amounts and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates for the company s financial instruments subject to interest rate risk thereafter short term investments fixed rate investments  weighted average rate long term investments fixed rate investments weighted average rate long term debt variable rate instruments  weighted average rate in the table above  the weighted average interest rate for fixed and variable rate financial instruments in each year was computed utilizing the effective interest rate for that instrument at december   and multiplying by the percentage obtained by dividing the principal payments expected in that year with respect to that instrument by the aggregate expected principal payments with respect to all financial instruments within the same class of instrument 
at december   the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  claims payable and payables to plan sponsors and others approximate fair value due to their short term nature 
because management does not believe that its exposure to interest rate market risk is material at this time  the company has not developed or implemented a strategy to manage this market risk though the use of derivative financial instruments or otherwise 
the company will assess the significance of interest rate market risk from time to time and will develop and implement strategies to manage that risk as appropriate
