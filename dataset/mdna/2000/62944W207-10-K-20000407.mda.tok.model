the following table sets forth  as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented  revenues related to each of i license and territory  ii facility management and sludge processing  iii alkaline admixture  iv royalty and v other revenues for the year ended december  facility management and sludge processing royalty license and territory fees alkaline admixture other totals facility management and sludge processing revenues are recognized under contracts where the company itself utilizes the n viro process to treat sludge  either pursuant to a fixed price contract or based on volumes of sludge processed 
royalty revenues represent ongoing amounts received from licensees for continued use of the n viro process and are typically based on volumes of sludge processed 
license and territory fees represent non recurring payments for the right to use the n viro process in a specified geographic area or at a particular n viro facility 
the company s policy is to record fully revenues payable pursuant to agency and license agreements when the company has fulfilled substantially all of its obligations under the relevant contract  except when the license agreement pertains to a foreign contract 
in this case revenue is recorded when cash is received and when the company has fulfilled substantially all of its obligations under the relevant contract 
alkaline admixture revenues represent ongoing payments from licensees arising from the sale and distribution of alkaline admixture by the company and the agents to n viro facilities 
other revenues represent n viro soil sales  research and development revenue  commissions earned on sales  rental of equipment to a licensee or agent  or testing income 
n viro soil sales are either through royalties from sales of n viro soil sold by n viro facilities  or through sales of n viro soil sold directly by the company 
in the company redrafted its standard technology license to include all royalty and alkaline commission income in its on going professional services fee 
this change allows licensees to directly acquire all alkaline admixtures  providing such materials meet n viro specifications 
moreover  in the company offered new and old licensees the opportunity to pre pay on going professional services fees on a one time up front basis 
a present value concept is used to determine the revenue on an up front basis 
cost of goods sold expenses principally reflect sludge processing costs principally labor and equipment  costs of acquiring and transporting alkaline admixture  and storage of n viro soil
