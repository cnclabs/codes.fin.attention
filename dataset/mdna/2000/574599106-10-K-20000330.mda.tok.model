historically  the company has been able to largely offset cyclical declines in housing markets through new product introductions and acquisitions as well as market share gains 
corporate development mergers and acquisitions have historically contributed significantly to masco s long term growth  even though generally the initial impact on earnings is minimal after deducting transaction related costs and expenses such as interest and added depreciation and amortization 
the important earnings benefit to masco arises from subsequent growth of such companies  since incremental sales are not impacted by these expenses
