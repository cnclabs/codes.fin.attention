based on its current operating plan  the company believes that its cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand  cash flows from operations and current available lines of credit will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflationary increases in costs have not been material in recent years and  to the extent permitted by competitive pressures  are passed on to the clients through increased billing rates 
rates charged by the company are based on the cost of labor and market conditions within the industry 
the company was able to increase its billing rates over its increases in direct labor in this is due primarily to our increase in client strategic services in which competition is less and the quality of services commands higher rates 
year issues the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
keane s computer equipment and software and devices with embedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of keane s operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to perform mission critical functions like billing and time reporting 
although the transition from to has passed and keane is not aware of any unresolved year problems relating to the services provided by keane  its internal systems  the products developed by keane s healthcare solutions practice or third party products used by keane in its healthcare solutions practice  it is possible that year problems could be discerned in the future 
keane generally delivers services and not products to its customers 
the company believes that the services provided by its professionals to its customers are provided in a year compliant manner 
keane s healthcare solutions practice develops  markets  and sells software products 
in  keane notified its customers that it did not intend to offer year compliant versions or patches for certain of its products that were known to be year non compliant 
instead  keane encouraged its clients to migrate to new products offered by keane 
keane believes that it may have had an immaterial loss of customers in the healthcare solution practice due to clients who failed to migrate to its newer products 
in addition to its own products  keane markets certain third party software products through its healthcare solutions practice 
during  the company received assurances from substantially all of the vendors of these products that they are year compliant 
customer claims regarding year issues related to these products were immaterial 
in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company incurred approximately  during in connection with remediating its systems 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addresses promptly 
among the services that keane provided in was the assessment  planning  migration remediation  and testing for year compliance 
keane has devoted significant resources to  and earned significant revenue from  providing services to address the year problem 
the market for these services declined significantly during and is expected to further diminish and disappear after the first quarter of further  keane s services addressing the year problem involve key aspects of its client s computer systems 
a failure in a client s system could result in a claim for substantial damages against keane  regardless of keane s responsibility for the failure 
keane could incur substantial costs in connection with any resulting litigation  regardless of the outcome 
the total cost of keane s year compliance activities was not material to its business  results of operations and financial condition 
while keane believes that it has completed its year readiness process  keane cannot assure you that it has identified and remedied all significant year problems  that keane will not incur significant additional time and expense or that such problems will not harm keane s business 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
fluctuations in operating results 
keane has experienced and expects to continue to experience fluctuations in its quarterly results 
keane s gross margins vary based on a variety of factors including employee utilization rates and the number and type of services performed by keane during a particular period 
a variety of factors influence keane s revenue in a particular quarter  including o general economic conditions which may influence investment decisions or cause downsizing  o the number and requirements of client engagements  o employee utilization rates  o changes in the rates keane can charge clients for services  o acquisitions  and o other factors  many of which are beyond keane s control 
a significant portion of keane s expenses does not vary relative to revenue 
as a result  if revenue in a particular quarter does not meet expectations  keane s operating results could be materially adversely affected  which in turn may have a material adverse impact on the market price of keane common stock 
in addition  many of keane s engagements are terminable without client penalty 
an unanticipated termination of a major project could result in an increase in underutilized employees and a decrease in revenue and profits 
risks relating to acquisitions 
in the past five years  keane has grown significantly through acquisitions 
since january   keane has completed the acquisitions of emergent corporation in san mateo  california  amherst consulting group  inc  in boston  massachusetts  advanced solutions inc in new york  new york  anstec  inc of maclean  virginia  first coast systems  inc 
of jacksonville  florida  jamison gold  llc  of marina del ray  california and parallax solutions limited  of birmingham  england 
keane s future growth may be based in part on selected acquisitions 
at any given time  keane may be in various stages of considering such opportunities 
keane can provide no assurances that it will be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or that it will be successful in entering into a definitive agreement with any one target 
also  even if a definitive agreement is reached  there is no assurance that any future acquisition will be completed 
keane typically anticipates that each acquisition will bring certain benefits  such as an increase in revenue 
prior to completing an acquisition  however  it is difficult to determine if such benefits can actually be realized 
accordingly  there is a risk that an acquired company may not achieve an increase in revenue or other benefits for keane 
in addition  an acquisition may result in unexpected costs and expenses 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on keane s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the process of integrating acquired companies into keane s existing business may also result in unforeseen difficulties 
unforeseen operating difficulties may absorb significant management attention which keane might otherwise devote to its existing business 
also  the process may require significant financial resources that keane might otherwise allocate to other activities  including the ongoing development or expansion of keane s existing operations 
finally  future acquisition could result in keane having to incur additional debt and or contingent liabilities 
all of these possibilities might have a material adverse effect on keane s business  financial condition and result of operations 
dependence on personnel 
keane believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical and management personnel 
the competition for such personnel is intense 
keane may not succeed in attracting and retaining the personnel necessary to develop its business 
if keane does not  its business  financial condition and result of operations could be materially adversely affected 
highly competitive market 
the market for keane s services is highly competitive 
the technology for custom software services can change rapidly 
the market is fragmented  and no company holds a dominant position 
consequently  keane s competition for client assignments and experienced personnel varies significantly from city to city and by the type of service provided 
some of keane s competitors are larger and have greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition in the markets they serve than does keane 
in addition  clients may elect to increase their internal information systems resources to satisfy their custom software development needs 
keane believes that in order to compete successfully in the software services industry it must be able to o compete cost effectively  o develop strong client relationships  o generate recurring revenues  o utilize comprehensive delivery methodologies  and o achieve organizational learning by implementing standard operational processes 
in the healthcare software systems market  keane competes with some companies that are larger in the healthcare market and have greater financial resources than keane 
keane believes that significant competitive factors in the healthcare software systems market include size and demonstrated ability to provide service to targeted healthcare markets 
keane may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures faced by keane may materially adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with provision of year services 
the company s business may suffer as a result of defects to year compliance issues that have not yet been detected 
we have not had any independent verification of our year compliance efforts 
we have not procured any year specific insurance or made any contingency plans to address any undetected year risks 
among the services that keane provided in was the assessment  planning  migration remediation  and testing for year compliance 
keane has devoted significant resources to  and earned significant revenue from  providing services to address the year problem 
the market for these services declined significantly during and is expected to further diminish and disappear after the first quarter of further  keane s services addressing the year problem involve key aspects of its client s computer systems 
a failure in a client s system could result in a claim for substantial damages against keane  regardless of keane s responsibility for the failure 
keane could incur substantial costs in connection with any resulting litigation  regardless of the outcome 
international operations 
in august  keane commenced operations in the united kingdom with its acquisition of icom systems ltd  now known as keane limited 
keane s international operations will be subject to political and economic uncertainties  currency exchange rate fluctuations  foreign exchange restrictions  changes in taxation and other difficulties in managing operations overseas 
keane may not be successful in its international operations 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
keane believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and it expects that results of operations may fluctuate from period to period in the future
