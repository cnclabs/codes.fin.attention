overview concur technologies  inc tm is a leading provider of corporate expense management software and services that automate costly and inefficient business processes  allowing companies to leverage their most limited resources time  money  knowledge  and energy 
our software products include concur expense tm for travel and entertainment expense management  concur payment tm for employee requests for vendor payments  concur time tm for time tracking and reporting  and concur human resources tm for human resources self service 
these software products are designed to meet the needs of businesses of all sizes through license and application service provider asp models 
since  more than companies  representing over three million employees  have selected our software and services to reduce their costs and increase their productivity and access to data about their internal business processes 
we sell our software and services through our direct sales organization and through indirect channels 
we also have developed a number of strategic relationships 
currently  one of our most significant reseller arrangements is with adp  inc  a subsidiary of automatic data processing  inc  a global payroll solutions and computing services provider 
adp has agreed to resell and jointly market our asp solutions for travel and entertainment expense management to adp s existing customers and potential new customers 
we were incorporated in and commenced operations in fiscal  initially developing quickxpense  a retail  shrink wrapped application that automated travel and entertainment expense reporting for individuals 
we first shipped quickxpense in fiscal and sold quickxpense through a combination of retail channels and direct marketing  utilizing a small sales force and no consulting or implementation staff 
in response to inquiries from businesses seeking to automate the entire travel and entertainment expense reporting process  including back office processing and integration to financial systems  we significantly expanded our product development efforts and released concur expense  a client server based enterprise travel and entertainment expense management solution in july in march  we shipped an intranet based version of concur expense 
since its release  the intranet based version has accounted for a majority of concur expense license revenues 
on june   we acquired software  inc  a privately held software company and the developer of concur procurement 
software was incorporated in may software was selling the initial version of its product through a single sales representative at the time of the acquisition 
after our acquisition we continued to sell concur procurement until we announced on june  that we had discontinued offering it for sale as part of our new operating plan 
on june   we acquired seeker software  inc  a privately held software company and developer of concur human resources 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
these consolidated financial statements have been prepared to reflect the restatement of all periods presented to include the accounts of seeker software 
the historical results of the pooled entities reflect each of their actual operating cost structures and  as a result  do not necessarily reflect the cost structure of the newly combined entity 
upon our acquisition of seeker software  it was our intention to integrate concur human resources with concur expense and concur procurement as a suite of solutions through a common user interface known as concur eworkplace 
on june   after carefully studying the cost of this integration effort and its related benefits  we announced that we would not integrate these products into a single product suite  but rather keep concur human resources as a separate product offering 
in october  we began offering concur expense and concur procurement as an application service provider asp solution  principally for small and mid size companies 
our asp solution requires limited it infrastructure and limited it support 
in december  we introduced an asp offering for large companies that want a configured solution offered on an outsourced basis with limited it infrastructure and support requirements 
on june   we announced a new operating plan  under which we discontinued concur procurement and discontinued the planned integration of concur human resources with our other corporate expense management solutions as a suite of solutions through a common user interface 
additionally  we announced a workforce reduction of employees to bring our cost structure in line with our new operating plan 
the primary goals of our new operating plan are to focus on corporate expense management solutions and to focus on generating positive cash flow and profits 
results of operations revenues years ended september  dollars in thousands change change licenses    services    total revenues    we market our software and services primarily through our direct sales organization in the united states  canada  and the united kingdom 
revenues from licenses and services to customers outside the united states were million   and  in the years ended september    and  respectively 
historically  as a result of the relatively small amount of international sales  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on our operating results 
we had no customer that accounted for more than of our revenues in   or license revenues 
license revenues consists of license fees for software and asp setup and usage fees 
the dollar decrease in license revenues in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to 
our emphasis during the first half of fiscal on marketing and selling concur procurement and concur human resources  which caused sales of concur expense to decline  
increased demand from our customers during fiscal to purchase our asp solutions where revenue is recognized over a multiple year relationship instead of up front as a license fee  
our june  decision to discontinue concur procurement and to discontinue our planned integration of concur human resources with our other corporate expense management solutions as a product suite  which caused us to lose some sales  and 
a million sales allowance in the second half of fiscal for sales returns associated with discontinuing concur procurement 
the increase in revenues in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to the market acceptance of concur expense  and to a lesser degree  concur human resources 
also driving this increase in revenues was an increase in the size and productivity of our sales force and sales related to referrals attributable to our december strategic marketing alliance agreement with american express 
we believe our license revenues will increase in fiscal compared to fiscal  as we focus more on selling our corporate expense solutions and exploiting expected demand for our asp solutions 
service revenues 
service revenues consists of consulting service fees  customer support fees  and training fees 
service revenues represented   and of total revenues for fiscal   and  respectively 
the dollar increases in service revenues  and the increases in service revenues as a percentage of total revenues  for fiscal and fiscal primarily reflected increased consulting revenue associated with sales  upgrades  and enhancements of concur expense  and to a lesser degree  concur human resources license sales  as well as increased revenues related to customer support contracts entered into in the current and prior periods 
during the second half of fiscal  we developed a streamlined approach to deployment of concur expense  known as express implementation  which benefits the customer with a faster best practices installation at a lower deployment cost 
as a result  our consulting service fees for each deployment are reduced 
accordingly  we expect consulting service fees in fiscal to increase only slightly over fiscal customer support fees are typically billed on an annual contract and amortized over the period of the contract 
the majority of our license customers choose a customer support contract 
we expect customer support fees to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal with the continued increase in our customer base 
overall  we expect service revenues to grow modestly in fiscal compared to fiscal revenue recognition 
for fiscal and prior years  we recognized revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position software license revenues were recognized when a non cancelable license agreement was signed with a customer  the software was shipped  no significant post delivery vendor obligations remained and collection was deemed probable 
maintenance revenues were recognized ratably over the contract term  typically one year 
revenues for consulting services were recognized as such services were performed 
commencing with fiscal  we recognize revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  or sop and statement of position  which amended certain provisions of sop these standards generally require revenues earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements  such as software products  upgrades  enhancements  post contract customer support  installation and training  to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on evidence that is specific to the vendor 
evidence of the fair value of each element is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
the revenues allocated to software products  including specified upgrades or enhancements  generally are recognized upon delivery of the products 
the revenues allocated to unspecified upgrades  updates and other post contract customer support generally are recognized ratably over the term of the related maintenance contract 
revenues relating to consulting and training services provided to customers are generally recognized as such services are performed 
if evidence of the fair value for all elements of the arrangement does not exist  all revenues from the arrangement are deferred until such evidence exists or until all elements are delivered 
in addition  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
concur is required to adopt the provisions of sab in the forth quarter of fiscal further implementation guidelines and changes in interpretations of such guidelines could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices that could affect our future revenues and earnings 
cost of revenues years ended september  dollars in thousands change change licenses   percentage of licenses services    percentage of services total cost of revenues    percentage of total revenues cost of license revenues 
in fiscal  cost of license revenues included the cost of our asp operations  which includes salaries  computers and other telecommunications costs  amortization of deferred costs  and reseller fees 
additionally  cost of license revenues in fiscal   and included amortization of purchased technology  royalties for sub licensing third party software and the costs of manuals and media for licensing our products 
the dollar increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the introduction of our asp solution and the costs associated with this method of delivery and  to a lesser extent  an increase in royalties paid for sub licensing third party software 
the dollar increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily a result of the amortization of capitalized technology recorded in connection with our june  acquisition of software  and to a lesser extent reflects increased expenses associated with sub licensing of third party software due to increased sales of concur expense  and the costs of production  manuals and other media associated with licensing our products 
we expect that the dollar cost of license revenues will increase in the future depending in part on the demand for our current software products and asp solutions 
cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues includes primarily the salaries  non reimbursable expenses  and other operating costs of employees who provide consulting services and product training 
the dollar increase in both fiscal and fiscal  was primarily due to increases in professional service personnel to manage and support our growing customer base 
cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues may vary between periods due to changes in the level and mix of services provided by us or by our partners 
operating expenses years ended september  dollars in thousands change change sales and marketing    percentage of total revenues research and development    percentage of total revenues general and administrative    percentage of total revenues merger and acquisition costs    percentage of revenues restructuring charges  percentage of total revenues total operating expenses    percentage of total revenues sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  travel  and facility costs for the company s sales and marketing personnel  and  to a lesser extent  advertising  trade shows and other promotional activities 
the dollar increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related expenses due to an increase in the number of personnel in the sales and marketing area and  to a lesser extent  an increase in advertising and other promotional activities in the first half of fiscal the dollar increase in compared to primarily reflects our investment in our sales and marketing infrastructure  including significant personnel related expenses such as salaries  benefits and commissions  recruiting fees  travel and entertainment expenses  and related costs of hiring sales management  sales representatives  sales engineers  and marketing personnel 
the increases also reflect increased public relations and trade show expenses  and sales referral fees paid under our agreement with our referral partners  principally american express 
it also reflects the cost of our ongoing international expansion of our sales organization into the united kingdom  and to a lesser degree  australia 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to decline modestly in fiscal as we focus on greater operational efficiencies 
research and development 
research and development expenses include salaries and contract labor for software development  facility costs and expenses associated with computer software and hardware used in our software development 
the increases in both fiscal and fiscal were primarily related to increased hiring of employees and outside contractors for software engineers  program management  and quality assurance personnel to support our expanded product lines and ongoing product development  and to a lesser extent  higher salaries paid to employees due to an increase in market rates 
we believe that an increase in our research and development investment is essential for us to maintain our market position  to continue to expand our product lines  and to enhance the technology platform for our corporate expense management solutions 
accordingly  we anticipate that we will modestly increase our costs in product research and development in fiscal in the development of our new products and enhancements of existing products  the technological feasibility of the software is not established until substantially all product development is complete 
historically  software development costs eligible for capitalization have been insignificant  and all costs related to internal research and development have been expensed as incurred 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include costs associated with finance  accounting  investor relations  human resources  administration and facilities 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts  contract labor  and occupancy and telecommunication costs 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from a combination of factors  including the hiring of additional general and administrative personnel to support the growth of our business  the increased use of outside contractors associated with increased recruiting efforts  the higher amortization of deferred stock compensation  and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to our increase in revenues 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will decrease modestly in fiscal as the we focus on greater operational efficiencies 
merger and acquisition costs 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we revised our estimates for certain accrued costs related to our merger with seeker software in june these adjustments resulted in a reduction of merger and acquisition costs of million in fiscal in connection with our merger with seeker software  we recorded a charge to operating expenses of approximately million in the quarter ended september  for direct and other merger related costs pertaining to the transaction 
merger costs consisted primarily of financial advisor fees for both companies  attorneys  accountants  financial printing  and other related charges 
in connection with the acquisition of software  we recorded a one time charge of million for in process technology as an expense in the quarter ended june  restructuring charges 
on june   we announced a new operating plan to focus the company on providing solutions to meet the needs of the corporate expense management market 
the decision to implement this new operating plan was based on a desire to focus our resources on our corporate expense management products  to reduce operating expenses  and to bring expenses in line with our new operating plan 
in connection with our announcement  during the three months ended june   we recorded a one time restructuring charge of million resulting primarily from severance and termination benefits and  to a lesser extent  the write off of intangible assets relating to our procurement technology acquired in connection with our june acquisition of software  costs associated with the abandonment of facilities and equipment due to our workforce reduction and estimated costs to terminate product marketing programs resulting from our decision to discontinue concur procurement  our corporate procurement application 
interest income and interest expense years ended september  dollars in thousands change change interest income   interest expense   interest income and interest expense 
the increase in interest income for both fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to interest income earned on the higher cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as a result of proceeds received in december and april from our public offerings as well as our private placement in february the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to lower outstanding interest bearing obligations 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to additional bank borrowings and higher capital lease obligations 
provision for income taxes 
no provision for federal and state income taxes has been recorded because we have experienced net losses since inception that have resulted in deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance

this decrease was primarily due to the use of cash in our operations during the year offset by the proceeds received from the sales of our common stock in our february private placement offering 
as of september   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared to million at september   representing a decrease of million  or 
during december  we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with our ipo  resulting in proceeds to concur of approximately million  net of offering costs 
in connection with our ipo  we also received proceeds totaling million from the exercise of a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in april  we completed a follow on offering of our common stock and issued an additional  shares  resulting in proceeds to concur of approximately million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions  and other offering costs 
in february  we completed a private placement and received approximately million in cash  net of commissions and other offering costs 
our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million and million as of september  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
this increase was principally a result of increased service revenues associated with sales of concur expense and to a lesser degree  concur human resources 
days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable was days and days for the quarters ended september  and  respectively 
we expect that dso will fluctuate significantly in future quarters  and may even increase 
deposits and other assets were million and million at september  and  respectively 
deposits and other assets decreased primarily due to amortization of intangibles 
our total current liabilities were million and million as of september  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
this decrease consists primarily of a decrease in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and accrued commissions 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to a reduction in estimated merger costs and payment of certain accrued liabilities and a more current aging for accounts payable 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and to a lesser degree through the use of long term debt  notes payable to stockholders  and equipment leases 
our sources of liquidity as of september  consisted principally of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  all totaling million  and approximately million of available borrowings under a line of credit 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
for such periods  net cash used by operating activities was primarily a result of funding ongoing operations 
our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
property and equipment acquisitions  including those acquired under capital leases  totaled million  million  and million in fiscal  and  representing increases of million  or in from and million or in from we financed a significant portion of our acquisitions of property and equipment through capital leases  which consist primarily of computer hardware and software for our employees as well as for our management information systems and our asp operations 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures in fiscal will be somewhat less than in fiscal as we do not anticipate the increase in personnel we experienced during the first half of fiscal our financing activities provided million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of million from our private placement 
we have a line of credit with a bank for million that expires in january the line of credit bears interest at the lending bank s prime rate plus 
borrowings are limited to of eligible accounts receivable  and are secured by substantially all of our non leased assets 
as of september   we had not borrowed under the line of credit  however  there was a standby letter of credit outstanding for  therefore  approximately million remained available under this line as of september  in september  we entered into a million senior term loan facility with the same bank with which we have the line of credit  pursuant to the terms of a security and loan agreement 
in april  the senior term loan facility was amended to allow for additional borrowings up to a total of million 
the facility  which bears interest at the lending bank s prime rate less  matures on february  payments were interest only through february   at which time we started to pay off the facility in equal monthly principal payments plus interest 
the loan agreement contains certain financial restrictions and covenants  with which we are currently in compliance 
as of september   the outstanding indebtedness under the loan agreement was in july  we entered into a subordinated loan and security agreement with an equipment lessor in the principal amount of million that bears interest at an annual rate of 
in may  this agreement was amended to allow for additional borrowings of million bearing interest at an annual rate of on the first million and on the remaining million  which expired on december  the notes are due in varying monthly installments through april  and contain certain restrictions and covenants  with which we are currently in compliance 
at september   the outstanding indebtedness under the subordinated loan agreement was million 
we also have an existing equipment line of credit with a bank  which is no longer available for additional borrowings 
principal payments of approximately  plus interest which accrues at the prime rate plus are due monthly through october at september   the outstanding indebtedness under the equipment line of credit was  in september  we entered into an additional subordinated promissory note agreement with an equipment lessor in the principal amount of million 
the note bears interest at  payments are due in monthly installments of approximately  including interest  and the note matures in november at september   the outstanding indebtedness under the subordinated loan agreement was  in june  we announced a new operating plan that focuses the company more on the corporate expense management market where we have our strongest competencies 
this new operating plan included a workforce reduction of employees and a reduction in our utilization of contract labor 
in addition  our new operating plan contains a focus on greater operational efficiencies 
we currently anticipate that  through the end of fiscal  we will experience a modest decline in our overall operating expenses 
in addition to the modest decline in operating expenses  we also believe that our revenues  especially for our asp solutions  will grow during fiscal this will have the effect of decreasing our operating losses and cash used in operations during fiscal we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
thereafter  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through private or public sales of securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  financing under leasing arrangements  or other available means 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
see factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition we may require additional financing to fund our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operating results are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our cash equivalents are invested in short term debt instruments while certain portions of our outstanding long term debt bear interest at variable rates 
based on our marketable securities portfolio and interest rates at september   a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of approximately  respectively  in the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio  however  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold
