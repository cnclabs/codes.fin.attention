general the company is one of the largest pharmaceutical services companies in the united states  with net revenue of approximately billion for the year ended december  the company s operations are comprised of pharmacy benefit management services and therapeutic pharmaceutical services 
these services are sold both separately and together to assist corporations  insurance companies  unions  government employee groups and managed care organizations throughout the united states in delivering prescription drugs to their members in a cost effective manner 
the company s net revenues generally include payments by its customers based on the price of pharmaceuticals dispensed to their members and administrative fees 
pharmaceuticals are dispensed from retail pharmacies included in one of the company s networks and from its wholly owned and operated mail service pharmacies 
costs of net revenues are comprised primarily of pharmaceutical acquisition costs and the cost of services associated with dispensing drugs and operating systems 
the company has begun to expand its strategy of marketing to managed care plans 
while this strategy is expected to result in higher revenues and higher average revenue per account  the company anticipates that its gross margins that is  gross profit as a percentage of net revenues will decrease in the future as it implements this strategy 
managed care plans typically involve a higher concentration of retail pharmacy services  which have a lower margin than the company s mail pharmacy and specialty therapeutic services 
the company anticipates that overall margins will decrease in the future as a result of the strategy of marketing to health plans and as its pbm services continue to increase at a faster rate than its higher margin specialty therapeutic services 
on november   the company announced that caremark  which includes its pbm  would become its core operating unit and announced its intention to divest its other businesses 
as a result  in the company restated its prior period financial statements to reflect the appropriate accounting for these discontinued operations 
additionally  the company recorded a charge related to discontinued operations of billion during the fourth quarter of and an additional related charge of million in the second quarter of on january   the company completed the sale of its government services business for million less certain working capital adjustments 
on march   the company completed the sale of its team health business for million  less certain expenses  and retained approximately of the equity of the recapitalized company 
the team health and government services businesses were the two divisions that comprised the company s contract services operations  which have been reported as discontinued operations 
through december   the company has also divested all its california ppm operations and clinics in its non california ppm operations  generating approximately million in gross proceeds  including the assumptions of liabilities by purchasers 
the company expects to sell the remaining four ppm clinics during the first half of the company has tax net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately billion as of december  because of the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax asset  the company has established a valuation allowance for the amount of the net deferred tax asset that is not otherwise expected to be used to offset deferred tax liabilities 
if not utilized to offset future taxable income  the net operating loss carry forwards will expire on various dates through the valuation allowance had the effect of reducing the company s effective tax rate for accounting purposes for the year ended december  to approximately  which results in a tax expense recognized for continuing operations that is closer to its actual cash taxes payable 
the company s taxes payable in and  until such time as its nols are utilized  will consist of state taxes in those states where it does not have state nol carryforwards  and alternative minimum taxes for federal income tax purposes 
the company expects its effective tax rate to be approximately after until such time as the nols are utilized 
results of operations for the years ended december   and continuing operations for the years ended december   and  net revenue was  million   million and  million  representing increases of million and million during and  respectively 
key factors contributing to this growth include new customer contracts  high customer retention  additional services provided to existing customers and drug cost inflation 
the preponderance of the company s revenue is earned on a fee for service basis through contracts covering one to three year periods 
revenues for selected types of services are earned based on a percentage of savings achieved or on a per enrollee or per member basis  however  these revenues are not material to total revenues 
operating income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
operating margins were  and for these same periods 
operating income represents earnings before interest and income taxes and excludes special charges 
the operating income and margins were lower in due almost entirely to a million loss recognized on a risk share contract 
this particular contract was the only significant pbm risk share contract 
during  the company renegotiated this risk share contract  changing it to a fee for service arrangement beginning in adjusting for the impact of the million loss contract reserve  operating margins for and were comparable 
the slight decrease in operating margin during resulted from an increase in the percentage of retail pharmacy revenue to total pharmacy revenue and the launch of new lower margin biotechnology drugs 
the increase in lower margin revenue was offset by aggressive cost reduction efforts 
special charges totaled million in and million in these charges primarily related to severance  occupancy costs for excess facilities and certain litigation 
net interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from to primarily relates to interest allocated to discontinued operations 
the net interest expense allocated to the discontinued operations was limited by generally accepted accounting principles  accordingly  the interest expense allocated to continuing operations is not necessarily indicative of the net interest expense those operations would have incurred as an independent entity on a stand alone basis 
the increase in interest expense from to primarily resulted from increased debt levels 
increases in debt levels were a result of substantial uses of cash in the company s discontinued operations for acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital requirements in and prior years 
under statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for income taxes sfas  the company is required to record a net deferred tax asset for the future tax benefits of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  as well as for other temporary differences  if realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management has considered reversing deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
however  the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible and net operating losses can be carried forward 
management believes  considering all available information  including the company s history of earnings after adjustments for nonrecurring items  special charges  permanent differences  and other appropriate items and after considering appropriate tax planning strategies  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million  which is the amount of the deferred tax assets in excess of the deferred tax liabilities 
the valuation allowance has been established due to the uncertainty of forecasting future taxable income 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf accounting for costs incurred in connection with a consulting contract or an internal project that combines business process reengineering and information technology eitf

impact of year the year issue concerns the ability of computer hardware and software to distinguish between the year and the year an inability to make this distinction could result in computer application failure 
during  the company completed a detailed assessment of all its information technology and non information technology hardware and software with regard to the year issue  with special emphasis on mission critical systems 
information and non information technology hardware and software were inventoried and those not year ready were identified  remediated ie  corrected or replaced and tested to ensure that they would  in fact  operate as desired according to year requirements 
the company expensed approximately million during in connection with remediating its systems 
as a result of its year readiness efforts  the company s mission critical information technology and non information technology systems successfully distinguished between the year and the year on january   without any mission critical application failure 
however  the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
it is possible that the company may experience year related problems in the future  particularly with its non mission critical systems  which may result in failures or miscalculations resulting in inaccuracies in computer output or disruptions of operations 
however  the company believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its mission critical computer systems and equipment 
the financial impact of future remediation activities that may become necessary  if any  cannot be known precisely at this time  but it is not expected to be material 
factors that may affect future results the future operating results and financial condition of the company are dependent on the company s ability to market its services profitably  successfully increase market share and manage expense growth relative to revenue growth 
the future operating results and financial condition of the company may be affected by a number of additional factors  including the company s divestiture of its discontinued operations  the proposed settlement and transition plan for the mpn operations in the state of california  the company s compliance with or changes in government regulations  including pharmacy licensing requirements and healthcare reform legislation  potentially adverse resolution of lawsuits pending against the company and its affiliates  declining reimbursement levels of products distributed  identification of growth opportunities  implementation of the company s strategic plan  liabilities potentially in excess of the company s insurance  and the company s liquidity and capital requirements 
changes in one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the future operating results and financial condition of the company

liquidity and capital resources general 
the company broadly defines liquidity as its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to meet its obligations and commitments

cash flows

cash used to fund exit costs  which are classified in current liabilities as other accrued expenses and liabilities  will be funded by the revolving credit facility  cash flows from continuing operations and proceeds from the sales of the discontinued operations 
the company believes that amounts available from the sales of discontinued operations  amounts available under the revolving credit facility  and cash flow from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund the cash requirements of the discontinued operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the cash generated from such sources will be sufficient to meet these funding needs 
if it is not  the company would seek to enhance its liquidity position through further modifications to the credit facility  incurrence of additional indebtedness  asset sales  restructuring of debt  and or the sale of securities
