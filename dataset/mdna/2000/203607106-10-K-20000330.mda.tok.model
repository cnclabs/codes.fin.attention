these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements are set herein under the caption forward looking statements 
the following discussion is intended to facilitate an understanding and assessment of significant changes in trends related to the financial condition of the company and the results of its operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
all references in the discussion to financial condition and results of operations are to the consolidated position and results of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole 
net income and profitability net income and diluted earnings per share reached record highs in of million and  respectively 
compared to  net income rose while earnings per share were up 
the company s share repurchase program continued to benefit earnings per share growth  since its inception in the fall of   shares or of shares outstanding have been bought back 
cash earnings per share diluted also reached record levels in  up to 
cash or tangible return on assets roa for was versus nominal roa at 
tangible return on equity roe for the year climbed percentage points over s level to  exceeding nominal roe by percentage points for the same period and placing the company s performance in the top quartile of its regional peer banks 
the difference between cash and nominal results reflects the contribution of the company s branch acquisitions on an economic basis  which excludes the non cash impact of amortizing the premiums paid for the acquisitions 
many analysts and investors consider cash results a better measure of core profitability and value created for shareholders than nominal results 
s recurring or core earnings were up from last year to million after removing the impact of one time income and expense items 
items excluded relate to investment gains and losses and expense associated with branch properties no longer in use 
the primary factors explaining s improvement are explained in detail in the remaining sections of this document and are summarized as follows o net interest income full tax equivalent basis increased or million due to a million increase in average earning assets 
average loans grew million while average investments went down million 
the growth in earning assets was funded by million more in average borrowings  offset by million less in average deposits 
the net interest margin improved by a meaningful basis points to on average 
o total noninterest income decreased by from to million  largely due to the company taking selected investment losses in when there were economic opportunities to swap for higher yielding securities instead of recognizing investment gains as it did in to maintain a steady level of investment income based on a total return approach 
revenues excluding net investment gains losses and the impact of branch properties no longer in use were up nicely for the fifth consecutive year to approximately million in  a  improvement 
o noninterest expense or overhead rose  or in compared to million or in unusual factors explaining s small increase include losses on fraudulent customer transactions related to a floor plan dealer during the summer and approximately  in one time expenses incurred to dispose of acquired branch properties no longer in use 
o loan loss provision expense rose a minimal  or over s level 
the full year loan loss provision covered total actual net charge offs by times  this margin serving as a precaution in the event the upstate new york economy weakens after its long sustained period of relative economic health 
net charge offs as a percent of average loans decreased basis points in to 
the unchanged level of provision was in part made possible by significantly lower installment loan net charge offs  indicative of more conservative underwriting practices and regular follow up surveillance adopted during nonperforming loans increased during to 
of loans outstanding at year end compared to 
one year earlier 
o the company s combined effective federal and state tax rate decreased basis points this year to 
the decrease resulted from improved tax planning and by an increased proportion of tax exempt municipal investment holdings  which were an attractive value in the above combination of factors resulted in a level of profitability which may be compared to that of cbsi s peer bank holding companies 
this group is comprised of companies nationwide having billion to billion in assets based on data through september  the most recently available disclosure as provided by the federal reserve system 
through year to date september  the company s return on average assets roa was 
compared to the peer norm of 
shareholder return on equity roe at for the same period ranked higher than the peer norm of  placing it in the th peer percentile 
the company s primary performance focus is on achieving returns to shareholders and is better measured by roe than roa 
underlying the growth in earnings per share was steady improvement on a quarterly basis 
the first three quarters of at  
and 
per share exceeded the same quarters by   and  respectively 
fourth quarter earnings per share at  a record high for the company  exceeded the same period by 
selected profitability and other measures return on average assets  return on average equity  dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows at december  percentage of net income to average total assets percentage of net income to average shareholders equity percentage of dividends declared per common share to net income per common share percentage of average shareholders equity to average total assets net interest income net interest income is the amount that interest and fees on earning assets loans and investments exceeds the cost of funds  primarily interest paid to the company s depositors as well as interest on borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york  a million m t bank line of credit  and dividends on the company s million in trust preferred stock 
net interest margin is the difference between the gross yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
net interest income with non taxable income converted to a full tax equivalent basis totaled million in  this represents a million or increase over the prior year 
the increase was due both to higher earning asset volumes  which had a positive impact on net interest income of million  and interest rate changes  which had a favorable impact of million 
with regard to the components of s net interest income  greater average earning assets of million helped contribute to the million or rise in interest income 
average loans grew a total of million in  with the most significant portion occurring in the latter half of the year 
overall interest and fees on loans grew million or as a result of this growth and came despite a basis point bp decrease in loan yields to  which was caused by declining market rates during and the first part of this rate environment also produced limited investment portfolio buying opportunities until mid  resulting in a million decrease in average investments 
despite the lower outstandings  s investment interest income was slightly higher 
or  than the prior year due to an increase in the average investment yield from to 
rising market rates in the latter half of  which both increased the yield on new investments and decreased the amount of premium amortization of the company s existing premium collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  caused this increase in average investment yield 
loans ended at billion  up million or 
the average ratio of loans to earning assets increased from in to in as a consequence of strong business development efforts in the lending function and the aforementioned decrease in average investments 
comparing year end over year end  however  investments were million higher  reflective of purchases during the more attractive rate environment beginning in mid through september   the company s loan yield was in the favorable th peer bank percentile while the investment yield was in the favorable th percentile 
the average earning asset yield fell basis points to in because of the aforementioned declining loan yield  partially offset by the higher investment yield and the increased mix of loans to earning assets 
total average fundings deposits and borrowings grew by million in  largely attributable to a million increase in short term borrowings in part  related to cash raised for potential year outflows  partially offset by lower municipal time deposit levels 
despite higher average fundings  interest expense decreased by million due to a drop in the average cost of funds  which as a percentage earning assets was reduced by bps to 
the rate on interest bearing deposits fell bps to  due largely to across the board drops in deposit rates beginning in the fall of and continuing into early and a bp lower borrowing rate reflecting declines in market rates 
overall  through september   the company s average cost of funds rate fell favorably to the th peer bank percentile  compared to being in the th percentile through september the bp decline in the average cost of funds from to  in contrast to the bp decline in the earning asset yield  caused cbsi s net interest margin to increase by basis points from in to this year 
the company s net interest margin ranked in the th peer bank percentile through september   which favorably compares to the th peer bank percentile through september  for fourth quarter  the net interest margin was compared to one year earlier 
this can be attributed to a higher earning asset yield up bps at  with only a slight increase up bp s in the rate on interest bearing liabilities at

noninterest income the company s sources of noninterest income are of four primary types financial services  comprised of personal trust  employee benefit trust  investment  and insurance products  specialty products  largely electronic products and mortgage banking and servicing activities  general banking services related to loans  deposits and other activities typically provided through the branch network  and periodic transactions  most often net gains losses from the sale of investments or other occasional events 
total noninterest income in decreased by to million  largely due to the lack of the prior year s million in investment gains including a pretax  realized upon adoption of fas compared to s  in investment losses 
revenues excluding net investment gains losses and the impact of branch properties no longer in use were up nicely for the fifth consecutive year to approximately million in  a  improvement 
fees from the financial services segment of noninterest income rose in to million compared to growth in the prior year 
over the last five years  financial services revenues have climbed at a compound annual growth rate of nearly  and now comprise over on total noninterest income excluding net investment securities gains losses 
the reduction in s growth rate largely reflects a slower rate of increase in the sale of mutual fund products due to several factors discussed below  which management believes to be temporary 
the specific performance of the company s several financial services businesses is as follows o fees from personal trust services were million  up in as compared to a increase in recurring trust fees which excludes periodic estate fees related to individual investment management accounts and annual trust administration together representing of personal trust income grew a combined 
personal trust assets under management reached over million by year end  up over the prior twelve months 
greater focus on business development  including pro active integration of its major referral sources the company s ten financial consultants  its benefit plans administrative services subsidiary  its newly acquired asset management subsidiary  elias asset management  inc see below  and the cbna branch network is expected to accelerate future fiduciary income growth 
o revenue from record keeping and consulting services provided by benefits plans administrative services  inc acquired in july  combined with investment management services through the bank s employee benefits trust division ebt  totaled million in compared to million in  an increase 
retirement plan assets  reflecting more than plan sponsors  reached nearly million at year end  up almost over months earlier 
bpa ebt supports defined benefit  b   k  esop and other forms of defined contribution plans  enhancing these products with voice response and transactional web services 
bpa has been endorsed by several trade organizations and mutual fund companies  thus  its market continues to grow from a local base to plan sponsors located in the urban centers of new york state and beyond 
o is the sixth year in which cbsi has offered mutual funds  annuities  and other investment products through financial consultants fcs located in various locations throughout the bank s branch network 
commission income from this source grew in to million  down from over growth in reasons for the reduced growth include greater attractiveness of the bank s own fixed income products cds due to s rising interest rates beginning in the late spring of upon which no commission income is earned  some lag in sales as the bank implemented in the spring its own more cost effective broker dealer subsidiary  community investment services  inc cisi  and reluctance of some customers to invest toward the end of in light of year concerns 
a dedicated cisi office was established in the late fall in lockport  new york  with its two new financial consultants bringing the bank wide total to ten fcs 
in addition  our newly established insurance agency  community financial services  inc cfsi  has expanded the product capabilities of the financial consultants by adding long term health care and other selected insurance products to their offerings 
revenues from cfsi were nominal in o community bank has long been in the business of selling creditor life and disability insurance to installment and mortgage loan customers through its branch system 
revenues from this activity  including the bank s annual dividend from the new york state bankers insurance subsidiary through which the insurance is written  plus commissions generated by the company s financial consultants  amounted to  in  up over last year 
a very significant contribution to the company s future growth in financial services income is the acquisition announced in february of elias asset management eam  based in williamsville  new york  a suburb of buffalo 
this transaction significantly expands our financial services capabilities and is expected to close during the second quarter of the year 
founded in  eam is a nationally recognized investment advisory firm with over million in assets under management  comprised of more than accounts with individuals  foundations  and corporate pension and profit sharing plans 
by acquiring eam  the company is merging the strengths of two organizations that have successfully worked together since in various trust department and pension management capacities  satisfying customer preferences for an even greater range of services 
the decision to acquire eam is consistent with the direction of the financial services industry toward more diversified and broadly based companies a trend that will accelerate as a result of financial modernization legislation see brief discussion in the certain regulatory considerations section of this form k in item business 
operating as a separate  independent subsidiary  eam and its existing clients will benefit from additional resources that will enable eam to maintain its high quality reputation  while adding valuable personnel and enhanced services 
as of year end  approximately of eam s million in revenues was derived from individuals  with nearly from corporate pension and thrift plans  and the remainder from foundations and charitable trusts 
in addition to its financial services businesses  another segment of the company s noninterest income is its specialty products  which largely include electronic products and mortgage banking and servicing activities 
these activities in contributed of noninterest income excluding net investment securities gains losses 
total revenues were million  down slightly from million in  primarily due to reduced mortgage banking revenues as discussed below 
over the last five years  specialty product revenues have grown at an annual compound growth rate of nearly 
o fees earned from electronic products reached million this year  up from this increase was primarily due to income from the company s visa affiliation  which rose to  reflecting continued growth of visa check card revenues climbing and visa merchant discount fees up 
atm surcharge income rose to  o mortgage banking fees were  in  down from  in the prior year 
the primary reasons for the decrease were the disproportionate impact of recognizing the value of the company s mortgage servicing rights in and the fact that secondary market mortgages were sold at a slight loss this year versus a  gain in s more favorable financial market environment 
loan servicing fees more than doubled in to  on a serviced loan portfolio of million  consisting of about  loans 
o lastly  the company established a relationship this year with a national  third party leasing company  synergy resources of bloomington  minnesota  which pays referral commissions on leases booked for cbna customers 
revenues were  largely from small equipment leases 
customers may submit applications by telephone  fax  or the internet 
the third and largest segment of the company s recurring noninterest income is the wide variety of fees earned from general banking services  which reached million in  up from the prior year 
this segment contributed of noninterest income excluding net investment securities gains losses 
the increase in these revenues is generally in the single digit range because they are largely dependent on deposit growth and expansion of services provided through the branch network 
however  cbsi s branch acquisitions beginning in have resulted in a five year annual compound growth rate in these revenues of nearly 
o service charges on deposit accounts and overdraft fees increased to million in  a growth rate compared to a growth rate in last year s faster growth rate reflects the full year impact of the company s mid branch acquisitions 
o general commissions and miscellaneous income at million were up in this increase is attributable to approximately more in miscellaneous service fees and a swing in canadian exchange revenue from a loss in to a slightly positive level this year 
income from periodic transactions in largely includes  in losses taken on million in investment sales  with the net proceeds reinvested at higher yields to achieve greater resulting cash flows than had the securities been held to maturity 
this amount compares to gains of million last year on a combined million in investment sales 
the investment gains and losses taken over the last two years are illustrative of the company s active management of its investment portfolio to achieve a desirable total return and a targeted level of combined interest income and securities gains losses across financial market cycles 
other amounts of periodic income in were a small  compared to  in the prior year  the latter was the combined result of a gain on life insurance and an asset sold  partially offset by losses on the sale of former acquired branch properties 
noninterest income  excluding transactions related to investment securities and disposal of branch properties  as a percent of operating income was in  a decrease of 
percentage points from the prior year 
excluding the impact of mortgage servicing rights and gains losses on the sale of secondary product in both years  the ratio would have been up 
percentage point  the increase being limited by the company s record growth in net interest income 
since  the percentage has risen percentage points from  resulting from a focused effort to raise product revenues less susceptible to interest rate fluctuation 
compared to peers as of september   this ratio remained in the th peer percentile 
in light of management s ongoing objective to grow noninterest income  opportunities to develop new fee based products are actively pursued  including newly permitted activities under the financial modernization act  and emphasis continues on the collection of fees minimizing limitation on waived fees for providing quality service 
in an effort to focus on and accelerate growth of the company s financial service businesses  michael a 
patton  who has headed for many years the bank s trust department and financial consultant activities along with general banking activities in the southern region  was named president  financial services  in february the following table sets forth selected information by category of noninterest income for the company for the years and quarters indicated

this year s overhead of million as a percent of average assets was  a slight decrease from in  however  the ratio remains in the peer normal th percentile 
excluding amortization of intangible assets  which is a significant non cash expense for the company and virtually non existent for its peer group  cbsi s noninterest expense ratio was in compared to for peers 
non interest expense for fourth quarter was million  unchanged compared to the same period 
for cbsi as a whole  higher personnel expense accounted for over of s increase in overhead  with personnel costs being up versus being higher in as a result of acquisitions 
salary  benefit  and payroll tax expense increased primarily because of modest annual merit awards for employees 
total full time equivalent staff at year end was versus at year end  down as the result of attrition 
nonpersonnel expense rose  or this year as opposed to a million or increase in this was largely caused by losses on fraudulent customer transactions related to a floor plan dealer during the summer and write downs of leases on former branch properties closed due to duplicate facilities within the same proximity 
in addition  the increased expense can be explained by set up costs of the company s newly formed real estate investment trust reit and more aggressive advertising 
these unfavorable items were partially offset by a reduction in delivery costs of mutual funds and other related products as a result of the creation of the company s own broker dealer subsidiary  lower supplies expense in part reflecting an improved system of control  and reduced occupancy expense due to the full year impact of the disposition of former branch properties in the efficiency ratio is defined at two levels 
the nominal ratio is total overhead expense divided by operating income full tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding net securities gains and losses 
the adjusted or recurring efficiency ratio additionally excludes one time expense and intangible amortization a non cash expense as well as all one time noninterest income  over the last five years  these one time items have related to the disposal of branch properties 
the lower the ratio  the more efficient a bank is considered to be 
in  the nominal efficiency ratio decreased percentage points to while the recurring ratio decreased percentage points to 
management believes it is more meaningful to use the recurring ratio to compare to national norms  because as mentioned above  most of the company s peers do not have intangible expense to the significance that cbsi has 
on that basis  cbsi s ratio is more favorable than the national peer bank holding company median of based on data available as of september  the improvement in the efficiency ratio is a function of several factors an increase in net interest margin due to a lower cost of funds and reduced premium amortization on the company s cmo securities  growth in earning assets  steady progress in developing more sources of noninterest income  and persistent control of overhead expense 
while the company s expense ratios have generally been favorable  management maintains a heightened focus on controlling costs and eliminating inefficiencies 
areas for improvement have been identified through detailed peer comparisons  a bank wide program of employee involvement  targeted use of outside consultants  and review of productivity enhancing technology 
these combined efforts are intended to offset pressure from future price increases and higher transaction volumes and enable the company to more fully benefit from economies of scale as it continues to grow 
specifically  the bank benefited more fully in from the spring installation of frame relay to lower the cost of data communications  the creation of a broker dealer subsidiary during first quarter which brought down the expense of delivering mutual funds and related products  and the overhead savings following disposition of acquired branch properties in the following table sets forth information by category of noninterest expense of the company for the years and quarters indicated 
s omitted years ended quarters ended december  december  personnel expense      net occupancy expense    equipment expense    professional fees    data processing expense     amortization of intangibles     stationary and supplies    deposit insurance premiums other      total      total operating expense as a percentage of average assets efficiency ratio noninterest expense excluding nonrecurring items and amortization of deposit intangibles divided by operating income excluding all nonrecurring items 
income and income taxes income before tax in was million  up over the prior year s amount  which excluded the impact of fas accounting for selected securities gains 
when income is recast as if all tax exempt revenues were fully taxable on a federal basis  and all securities gains are stated on a pretax basis  s results rose by million or before tax 
the main reasons for improved pretax earnings were the favorable million increase in net interest income full tax equivalent basis related to strong earning asset growth up or million on average and a  climb in recurring noninterest income 
these factors were partially offset by a modest  increase in overhead expense largely relating to merit pay increases and selected vendor price adjustments and the lack of the prior year s million in investment gains as compared to s  in investment losses see investments section of this form k 
loan loss provision expense was held virtually constant at the level 
the company s combined effective federal and state tax rate decreased basis points this year to 
the decrease resulted from effective tax planning  which was additionally benefited in by an organizational change in the first quarter  as well as increased purchases of tax exempt municipal investments during the year 
capital shareholders equity ended at million  down from one year earlier  primarily reflective of the after tax market value adjustment mva of the bank s available for sale investments  dividends paid to shareholders  and  shares of cbsi common stock that was repurchased during  or of shares outstanding since the fall of 
this stock repurchase program reflects the company s belief that its common stock is an excellent investment and that the financial markets are not fully valuing its strong banking franchise 
these capital outflows are partially offset by the contribution of earnings 
excluding the mva in both and  capital rose by million or 
shares outstanding fell by over  during due to the aforementioned repurchase of stock partially offset by the exercise of stock options 
despite the repurchase of stock  the ratio of tier i capital to assets or tier i leverage ratio  the basic measure for which regulators have established a minimum to be considered well capitalized  remains sound at and compares to one year ago 
the total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of as of year end was above the minimum requirement for well capitalized banks 
the company is confident that capital levels are being prudently balanced between regulatory and investor perspectives 
cash dividends declared on common stock in of million represented an increase of over the prior year 
this growth largely reflects a two cent per share increase in the quarterly common stock dividend beginning in the third quarter of from 
to 
nineteen ninety nine is the eighth consecutive year of dividend increases  which have resulted in a compound annual growth rate over that time period 
raising the company s expected annualized dividend to per common share reflects management s confidence that earnings strength is sustainable and that capital can be maintained at a satisfactory level 
the dividend pay out ratio for the year was approximately  slightly lower than the level of 
however  this level is at the higher end of the company s targeted pay out range for dividends on common stock of 
its pay out ratio has historically been strong relative to peers  ranging from the th to th percentile from through  including preferred dividends 
the peer pay out ratio remained high in the th peer percentile 
loans the amounts of the bank s loans outstanding net of deferred loan fees or costs at the dates indicated are shown in the following table according to type of loan as of december  s omitted real estate mortgages residential      commercial loans secured by real estate      farm      total      commercial  financial  and agricultural agricultural      commercial and financial      total      installment loans to individuals direct      indirect      student and other      total      other loans      gross loans      less unearned discounts     net loans      reserve for possible loan losses      loans  net of loan loss reserve      loans outstanding  net of unearned discount  reached a record million as of year end  up over million or compared to twelve months earlier 
this marks the seventh consecutive year of double digit loan growth with the exception of  when loan growth was held to due to a minimal increase in installment lending  in part reflecting adoption of more conservative underwriting practices 
about of s growth came from branches acquired in mid from key bank  na and fleet bank  with combined year end loans outstanding of million 
including approximately million in mortgages sold on the secondary market  net loan generation in was nearly million  more than last year and the highest generation in the company s history 
the company s predominant focus on the retail borrower enables its loan portfolio to be highly diversified 
approximately of loans outstanding are oriented to consumers borrowing on an installment and residential mortgage loan basis 
over the last several years  the growth rate of cbsi s commercial business loans has exceeded that of loans to individuals  and this sector exhibits a high degree of diversification as well 
loans are typically for amounts under  with nearly of our customers representing about of commercial loans outstanding 
only thirty three percent of our commercial portfolio about customers  including automobile dealers is comprised of loans in excess of  the portfolio contains no credit card receivables 
the overall yield on the portfolio is in the attractive th peer percentile 
the nature of lending table below recasts the company s loan portfolio into four major lines of business 
as previously discussed  much of the loan growth relates to acquired branch locations and resulting market opportunities 
the increase in business lending accounted for of the million in total loan growth in versus of s million increase 
the increase in consumer direct loans contributed toward total growth this year versus a reduction of in consumer indirect loans accounted for of this year s increase  up from in the prior year 
lastly  the share of this year s total loan increase for consumer mortgages was  down from s share of reflective of that year s highly favorable interest rate environment for home mortgage refinancing 
the following more fully discusses the underlying reasons for these changes by each of the company s four major lending activities or lines of business 
nature of lending mix at year end million and total loans consumer mortgage business lending consumer indirect consumer direct year s change s total change s total change s total change s total change the combined total of general purpose business lending  dealer floor plans  mortgages on commercial property  and farm loans is characterized as the company s business lending activity 
at million  this segment represents of loans outstanding at year end  having steadily expanded its share by eight percentage points since year end outstandings climbed over million or in compared to a growth rate for growth in the past two years has resulted from persistent business development efforts and the contributions of new lenders who joined the bank coincident with or as part of s acquisitions 
demand for installment debt indirectly originated through automobile  marine  and mobile home dealers rose in outstandings ended the year or million higher  primarily resulting from growth in the bank s southern region 
this compares to growth of or million in this portfolio segment  of which relates to automobile lending of the vehicles are used versus are new  constitutes of total loans outstanding  equal to s share but down from its peak of in the segment of the company s loan portfolio committed to consumer mortgages includes both fixed and adjustable rate residential lending 
it accounts for million or of total loans outstanding 
growth during the last two years million or in and million or in is attributable to the nationwide refinancing boom as well as promotion  especially in the bank s northern region  of this vehicle as a way for consumers to term out higher cost credit card debt 
portfolio growth is lower than it could have been due to a program which began in mid to sell selected fixed rate originations in the secondary market 
the purpose of this program  with sales of million in  million in and million this year  is to develop a meaningful source of servicing income as well as to provide an additional tool to manage interest rate risk 
the direct consumer lending activity increased this year after a slight decrease in s outstandings rose or million  in part reflective of a promotion largely in the bank s southern region  versus a decrease of or million in this line of business is comprised of conventional installment loans including some isolated installment lending to small businesses  personal loans  student loans which are sold once principle repayment begins  and borrowing under variable and fixed rate home equity lines of credit 
the consumer direct segment as a percent of total loans remained essentially unchanged at in after a decrease in the portfolio share in the portfolio share decrease in percentage points is partially explained by consumer borrowing being refinanced as mortgage debt in overall mortgage refinancing activity  as discussed above

the company s policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status and recognize income on a cash basis when it is more than ninety days past due  except when in the opinion of management it is well secured and in the process of collection 
provision and reserve for loan losses nonperforming loans  defined as nonaccruing loans plus accruing loans days or more past due  ended at million 
this level is approximately million or higher than one year earlier  solely attributable to the delinquency of a large commercial customer in the bank s northern region in the fourth quarter 
the customer experienced start up problems with a new piece of equipment  thus causing a delay in projected higher cash flow 
the equipment is now operative  and the associated million loan is fully backed by collateral and a small specific assignment of loan loss reserve  nonetheless  management continues to monitor this situation carefully 
accordingly  the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans has risen basis points from twelve months earlier to 
excluding the aforementioned delinquency  nonperforming loans would have decreased by  or to million 
as of september   when the nonperforming loan ratio stood at  the company s asset quality was in the favorable th percentile compared to peers 
the ratio of nonperforming assets which additionally include troubled debt restructuring and other real estate to total loans plus oreo increased to  up basis points from one year earlier 
total delinquencies  defined as loans days or more past due and nonaccruing  improved nicely in to finish the year at as a percent of total loans outstanding compared to in this ratio has remained in the to band for the last months  well within the company s internal guideline of

these measures compare favorably to median delinquencies of peer bank holding companies as of september  of   and  respectively 
as of september   when overall delinquencies were at  the company ranked better than the peer norm  being in the favorable th peer percentile 
factors contributing to successful underwriting  collection  and credit monitoring include selective addition of experienced lenders over the last several years  loan servicing placed at the regional level  collection departments focused on taking prompt corrective action  and a centralized loan review function which is given priority attention and has monthly board of director accountability 
net charge offs for were lower by  or  finishing the year at an improved million or 
of average loans compared to million and 
last year 
as a result of lower installment loan charge offs in  total gross charge offs fell to million  or 
of average loans outstanding versus 
in this year s recoveries rose to an all time record in dollar amount of  while down as a percentage of prior year gross charge offs to from in as of september   the bank s total net charge off ratio was in the th peer percentile based on the peer norm of 
significant progress in lowering net charge offs to more satisfactory levels is evidenced by a fourth quarter ratio of 
compared to 
one year earlier 
this year s reduction in installment loan net charge offs of million is indicative of more conservative underwriting practices and follow up surveillance adopted during  installment net charge offs averaged this year versus last year 
commercial loan charge offs were up by  in due to three specific commercial loans written down during the second and third quarters  the resulting net charge off ratio rose from 
to a still low 
of commercial loans outstanding 
the full year loan loss provision covered total actual net charge offs by times  this margin serving as a precaution in the event the upstate new york economy weakens after its long sustained period of relative economic health 
management continually evaluates loan loss reserve adequacy from a variety of perspectives  including projected overall economic conditions for the coming year  concentration of the loan portfolio by industry and loan type  and individual customer condition 
the loan loss reserve was increased to million versus million in  as a percent of total loans  the loss reserve ratio decreased to at year end from at year end the slight decrease in the ratio is consistent with the target established following assumption of million in loans associated with branches acquired from key and fleet bank in mid the reserve ratio is presently at the peer median  being in the th peer percentile  and coverage of nonperforming loans as of september  was well above the norm in the th percentile  management believes the year end coverage at to be ample 
it should be noted that the dollars in the reserve are more than the bank s actual combined losses of the last three years 
another measure of comfort to management is that after conservative allocation by specific customer and loan type  almost of loan loss reserve remains available for absorbing general  unforeseen loan losses 
as a percentage of average loans  the annual loan loss provision was well above the peer norm in the th percentile as of september  despite a reduction in the loss provision ratio from 
in to 
this year  the company increased coverage of the provision over net charge offs from times to times 
due to lower net charge offs in as discussed above  loan loss provision expense increased by only  in this compares to an increase of  and million in and  respectively

there are three primary sources of funding that comprise cbsi s overall funding matrix  which considers maturity  stability  and price deposits of individuals  partnerships and corporations ipc deposits  collateralized municipal deposits  and capital market borrowings 
sources of funds average th quarter balances million year ipc deposits public funds capital borrowings total funds sources amount total amount total amount total amount change the company s funding matrix continues to benefit from a high level of ipc deposits  which reached an all time record for a fourth quarter average of billion  an increase of million or from the comparable period 
ipc deposits are frequently considered to be a bank s most attractive source of funding because they are generally stable  do not need to be collateralized  have a relatively low cost  and because they represent a working customer base with the potential to be cross sold a variety of loan  deposit and other financial service related products 
the mix of cbsi s ipc deposits has changed over the last five years as measured by the trend of fourth quarter average balances 
the time deposit share grew steadily  from of deposits in to in  reflecting consumer movement away from immediately available  lower earning savings and money market accounts  in addition  there is a relatively high mix of time deposits in the branches that have been acquired over the last few years 
after a slight reduction in time deposit mix in to  s mix increased slightly to as a result of a million or increase in average fourth quarter outstandings 
excluding time accounts  fourth quarter ipc deposits were up by million or 
in  a million or increase in demand deposits more than offset slight reductions in other ipc categories 
deposits of local municipalities decreased million or during the past year  with balances for fourth quarter averaging million versus million for the same quarter 
under new york state municipal law  the company is required to collateralize all local government deposits with marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of this stipulation  management considers this source of funding to be equivalent to capital market borrowings 
as such  cbsi endeavors to price these deposits at or below alternative capital market borrowing rates 
consequently  levels of municipal deposits fluctuate throughout the year depending on how competitive pricing compares to the aforementioned borrowing rates 
it should be noted that utilization of municipal deposits has generally been decreasing since as a percent of total funding sources 
capital market borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowing sources for the company include the federal home loan bank of new york  federal reserve bank of new york  as well as access to the national repurchase agreement market through established relationships with primary market security dealers 
also considered as borrowings are the million in company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities issued to support s acquisitions and a million advance on a million m t bank line of credit tied to the day libor rate issued in late december 
capital market borrowings averaged million or of total funding sources for fourth quarter compared to million or of total funding sources for the same period in as of december   more than or million of capital market borrowings excluding the aforementioned line of credit and trust preferred securities had original terms of one year or less 
the short term borrowings at year end reflected the need for the company to remain in a highly liquid position in preparation for potential year yk cash outflows 
the average daily amount of deposits and the average rate paid on each of the following deposit categories is summarized below for the years indicated 
years ended december  average average average average average average balance rate paid balance rate paid balance rate paid non interest bearing demand deposits    interest bearing demand deposits    regular savings deposits    money market deposits    time deposits    total average daily amount of domestic deposits    the remaining maturities of time deposits in amounts of  or more outstanding at december  and are summarized below at december  s omitted less than three months   three months to six months   six months to one year   over one years   total   the following table summarizes the outstanding balance of short term borrowings of the company for the years indicated

this must be accomplished within the constraints of a absorbing funds when loan demand is low and infusing funds when demand is high  b implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income  c providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day to day business activities  d considering investment risk weights as determined by regulatory risk based capital guidelines  and e generating a favorable return without undue compromise of other requirements 
since  the company has utilized total return as its primary methodology for managing investment portfolio assets 
under this analytical method  the company seeks to maximize shareholder value through both interest income and market value appreciation 
based on balance sheet simulation work completed throughout  the bank s net interest margin exposure continued to point towards risk to falling interest rates 
much of this exposure could be explained by examining the strong growth in floating rate commercial loan assets and management s ability to the hold core ipc deposit rates low in the face of rising interest rates 
while such strategies benefit the bank s net interest margin nicely in a rising interest rate environment  they do begin to expose the bank to some risk should rates begin to fall over the next few years 
the reversal of falling interest rates in mid provided the bank with a strategic opportunity to not only increase net interest income but also address its falling interest rate risk concerns 
this was accomplished by extending the maturity and call protection of new investment purchases made throughout the year 
such purchases were evenly balanced between long term aaa rated municipal bonds and callable agency bonds with a minimum of four years of call protection 
for the year  new purchases totaled million with a weighted average life to first call date of years and a weighted average life to maturity of years 
this compares to purchases of million in with a weighted average life to first call date of years and a weighted average life to maturity of years 
the increase in interest rates also significantly reduced the prepayment exposure found in the bank s premium collateralized mortgage obligation cmo portfolio 
premium cmos  for purposes of this discussion  are defined as those securities with an original purchase price of or higher 
under general accounting standards  any premium paid for mortgage related bonds is required to be amortized to par using a constant yield methodology 
as mortgage prepayments decreased throughout the second half of the year  the monthly premium amortization associated with these bonds also decreased  thus boosting the overall investment portfolio yield in the average portfolio yield  excluding money market investments  rose to in from in the prior year 
in the fourth quarter of  the portfolio yield averaged versus for the same time period in the fourth quarter figure reflects the height of the premium cmo prepayments which the bank experienced during that year 
in the third and fourth quarters of  the bank embarked upon a municipal tax loss strategy whereby low coupon municipal notes were swapped for higher yielding long term municipal bonds 
this strategy resulted in net investment losses for the year of  on sales of million 
in  gains of million including  pretax realized upon adoption of fas  reported as an after tax change in accounting were recognized on a combined million in investment sales 
sales for the prior year were part of a deleverage strategy that helped provide the bank with an opportunity to repurchase  shares of common stock in the late summer and early fall of that year 
the composition of the portfolio continues to heavily favor us agency debentures  us agency mortgage backed pass throughs  us agency cmos  and aaa rated and insured municipal bonds 
as of year end  these four security types excluding federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock accounted for a combined of total portfolio investments   and  respectively  down slightly from in the prior year 
as stated previously  the bank s interest rate simulation work pointed towards the need to increase call protection within the overall balance sheet structure of the organization 
this was most readily accomplished by extending the average life of the portfolio through purchases made throughout the year as discussed above 
aiding in this task  though to a much lesser extent  was the slowdown experienced from prepayments within the fixed rate portion of the cmo portfolio 
as a result  the average life of the portfolio stood at years as of year end  up from years as of the prior year end

interest rate risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk  over both a short term tactical and longer term strategic time horizon  is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors  which reviews and approves them annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits  and overall market interest related level and trends 
as the company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements  it has maintained an appropriate process and set of measurement tools which enable it to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk 
the primary tool used by the company in managing interest rate risk is income simulation 
the analysis begins by measuring the impact of differences in maturity and repricing of all balance sheet positions 
such work is further augmented by adjusting for prepayment and embedded option risk found naturally in certain asset and liability classes 
finally  balance sheet growth and funding expectations are added to the analysis in order to reflect the strategic initiatives set forth by the company 
changes in net interest income are reviewed after subjecting the balance sheet to an array of treasury yield curve possibilities  including an up or down basis point movement bp in rates from current levels 
while such an aggressive movement in rates provides management with good insight as to how the company s profit margins may perform under extreme market conditions  results from a more modest bp shift in interest rates are used as a basis to conduct day to day business decisions 
historically with increases in the yield curve  income simulations have shown that the bank s net interest income tended to be higher than in flat rate environments 
this was caused by the bank s structural asset sensitivity which by definition indicates that earning assets would mature or reprice sooner than a corresponding liability and because loan and investment rates tended to closely track prime or movement in various treasurys while funding costs largely deposits generally moved upward at a much slower pace 
conversely  the same factors that widened simulated margins in a rising rate environment created risk in a falling rate environment 
the mid reversal of falling interest rates provided the bank with a strategic opportunity to not only increase net interest income but also address its falling interest rate risk concerns 
this was accomplished by extending the maturity and call protection of new investment purchases made throughout the year as further explained in the investments section of this document and by making the strategic decision to keep the bulk of the bank s borrowing position short terms of days or less as opposed to longer term borrowings 
as a result  if there were no growth in the balance sheet  simulation results now show the bank to be better off as rates fall 
the following reflects the company s one year net interest income sensitivity based on asset and liability levels on december   assuming no growth in the balance sheet  and assuming bp movements over a twelve month period in the prime rate  federal funds rate and the entire treasury yield curve regulatory model rate change dollar change percent of flat rate in basis points in s net interest income bp  bp 
a second simulation was performed based on what the company believes to be conservative levels of balance sheet growth for loans  for deposits and necessary increases in borrowings  with no growth in investment or any other major portions of the balance sheet  along with bp movements over a twelve month period in the prime rate and federal funds rate  and a yield curve moving closer to historical spreads to fed funds 
under this set of assumptions  the bank is able to better take advantage of rising rates as earning assets mature or reprice and are replaced at higher yields with the opposite occurring as rates fall 
thus  given the second set of assumptions  the risk of rate changes of the magnitude tested appears to be somewhat negated 
the following reflects the company s one year net interest income sensitivity analysis based on asset and liability levels on december  assuming the aforementioned balance sheet growth and yield curve changes management model rate change dollar change percent of flat rate in basis points in s net interest income bp

the preceding interest rate risk analyses do not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cashflows  and others 
while the assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
furthermore  the sensitivity analyses do not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
liquidity due to the potential for unexpected fluctuations in deposits and loans  active management of the company s liquidity is critical 
in order to respond to these circumstances  adequate sources of both on and off balance sheet funding are in place 
cbsi s primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the basic surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the relationship within days between liquid assets and short term liabilities which are vulnerable to nonreplacement  and second  a projection of subsequent cash availability over an additional days 
the minimum policy level of liquidity under the basic surplus deficit approach is of total assets for both the and day time horizons 
as of year end  this ratio was and  respectively  excluding the company s capacity to borrow additional funds from the federal home loan bank

year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather the four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
based on its assessment  the company determined that the majority of its processing systems are outsourced to industry standard vendors 
the company  through its year committee  has identified critical vendors and processes and have put in place monitoring and measuring techniques to assure its critical vendors are complying with the federal financial institutions examining council guidelines for year compliance 
in brief  the company s loan  deposit and general ledger systems are outsourced to fiserv  inc  the investment accounting is outsourced to first tennessee bank  atm processing is outsourced to u 
s 
bank network services  and the trust account system employs sungard software 
the company is subject to quarterly reviews by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  including year compliance 
the company completed formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the status of year compliance and if appropriate contingency plans and business resumption plans were in place in the unlikely event the vendor or customer should experience a year compliant failure 
the company has utilized both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace  test and validate the software for year modifications 
the company has spent  for overall year upgrades and equipment along with an additional estimated labor cost of  the expenditures included but were not limited to upgrades to item processing software and hardware  pc software and hardware  ncr atm s  third party reviews of outsourcing vendors  proxy testing  the cost of service vendor mailings  follow up testing  customer awareness efforts and commercial customer risk assessments 
the company completed all renovations on critical systems prior to the roll over to year  including modifications to existing software and conversions to new software 
as a result  the year issue had no impact on the company s operation 
as a further precaution  cash reserves in the branches were maintained well above normal year end levels  but there was no activity that was out of the ordinary 
large cash reserves were then shipped out of the branches during the week of january rd  and cash levels are now back to normal operating levels 
as a result of a supportive senior management team  an energetic yk committee and a cooperative staff company wide  cbsi s yk transition was smooth and uneventful 
roll over weekend went very well with only a couple of minor issues  which were resolved on january or january rd 
all subsidiaries  departments and branches of the company participated in event weekend testing  and all was in order for reopening on january rd 
as of the date of this filing  the company has not incurred any significant business interruption as a result of the year issue 
the company will continue to monitor the issue throughout and expeditiously remediate any issues that may arise 
based on the company s readiness efforts  the company does not reasonably foresee any material year issues  and therefore  costs associated with any potential issues are not expected to have a material adverse effect on either the financial condition or operating capacity of the company 
new accounting pronouncements in  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
upon adoption of the sfas the company transferred investment securities from held to maturity to available for sale see note c 
as a result  securities previously classified as held to maturity were sold during the year and investment securities gains of approximately  net of tax  resulting from the sale have been reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the company has no outstanding derivative financial instruments and  accordingly  adoption of sfas had no other effect on the company s financial statements

this statement requires that after the securitization of a mortgage loan held for sale  an entity engaged in mortgage banking activities classify the resulting mortgage backed securities or other retained interests based on its ability and intent to sell or hold those investments 
sfas no 
is effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after december  and accordingly  would apply to the company for the quarter ending march  the company has not engaged in the securitization of its mortgage loans held for sale and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
therefore  this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the company
