impact of year the year computer problem can occur when a computer that has been programmed to store dates as two digit numbers rather than four digit numbers cannot properly recognize dates beyond computer calculations using such two digit dates may inaccurately interpret a date stored as as the year rather than the year  possibly resulting in incorrect calculations  execution of faulty logic  or outright system failure

under the terms of the swap agreement  the company may be required to pledge certain assets if the market value of the interest rate swap falls below an amount set forth in the agreement
