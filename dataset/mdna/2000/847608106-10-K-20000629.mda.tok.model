for the year ended march  fiscal  nortel and lgic accounted for approximately and of net revenues  respectively 
during the year ended march  fiscal  nortel and lgic accounted for approximately and of net revenues  respectively 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations have been materially adversely affected in the past by anticipated orders failing to materialize and by deferrals or cancellations of orders as a result of changes in oem requirements 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the fiscal year ended march   and the first and fourth quarters of fiscal  product orders fell sharply resulting in substantial losses in those fiscal periods 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such fluctuations in the future 
in september  the company announced that it expected that it would not be developing new products for nortel but would continue to supply nortel item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued with existing products 
if the company is unable to find other customers to generate demand for its new products  the company s revenues may be materially adversely affected 
if the company were to lose nortel or any other major oem customer  or if orders by nortel or any other major oem customer were to otherwise materially decrease either in unit quantity or in price  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
during fiscal  and  sales outside of the united states were  and  respectively 
the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of the company s net revenues for the foreseeable future 
financial market turmoil  economic downturn  consolidation or merger of customers  and other changes in business conditions in any of the company s current or future markets  such as korea and france  may have a material adverse effect on the company s sales of its products 
furthermore  because the company s products are priced in us dollars  currency fluctuations and instability in the financial markets that are served by the company may have the effect of making the company s products more expensive than those of other manufacturers whose products are priced in the local currency of the customer and may result in reduced revenues for the company 
in sunnyvale  california  the company manufactures low volume single carrier and multicarrier power amplifier products  and services all of its power amplifier products 
in addition  the company operates a four inch semiconductor wafer fabrication facility and semiconductor assembly and testing operation in sunnyvale  california 
during fiscal  the company transitioned the assembly and test of its higher volume single carrier power amplifier products to a contract manufacturer located in thailand on a turnkey basis 
in fiscal  the company plans to transfer the remaining power amplifier production in sunnyvale to the contract manufacturer 
the company utilizes contract manufacturing to decrease the company s manufacturing overhead and costs of its products  to increase flexibility to respond to fluctuations in product demand and to leverage the strengths of the contract manufacturer s focus on high volume  high quality manufacturing 
the cost of transitioning manufacturing activities to the contract manufacturer in fiscal were higher than the savings from costs of products  which adversely affected the company s gross margin for fiscal the company anticipates that its gross margin will be adversely affected in fiscal during the transition of the remaining power amplifier production to the contract manufacturer 
as a result of its wafer fabrication facility and other manufacturing and development infrastructure  the company has a high level of fixed costs and is dependent upon substantial revenue to maintain profitability 
the company s semiconductor fabrication facilities entails a number of risks  including a high level of fixed and variable costs  the management of complex processes  dependence on a single source of supply for certain components and services  and a strict regulatory environment 
during periods of low demand  high fixed wafer fabrication costs are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
in addition  the company s strategy of frequently introducing and rapidly expanding the manufacture of new products to meet evolving oem customer and wireless service provider needs has caused the company to experience high materials and manufacturing costs  including high scrap and material waste  significant material obsolescence  labor inefficiencies  high overtime hours  inefficient material procurement and an inability to realize economies of scale

the company s sg a expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  sg a expenses represented of net revenues for fiscal as compared to of net revenues for fiscal the increase in sg a expenses on a dollar basis for fiscal was in principal due to increased commissions and added maintenance and support for the new enterprise resource planning erp system 
the decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the increased revenue levels 
restructuring costs 
during fiscal  the company transitioned the assembly and test of its higher volume single carrier power amplifier products to a contract manufacturer located in thailand on a turnkey basis 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to transfer the remaining power amplifier production in sunnyvale  california  to the contract manufacturer to utilize lower labor costs than available domestically and to reduce fixed overheads 
in connection with the decision  the company recognized in fiscal an approximately million restructuring charge for estimated severance costs related to organizational changes and a planned reduction in work force 
approximately employees engaged in manufacturing and production related functions are anticipated to be terminated as a result of the restructuring 
the transfer of production to thailand is expected to be completed during the third quarter of fiscal interest income 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in interest income for the year was a result of lower interest bearing investment balances associated with the reduced average cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense for the year was a result of substantially reduced average borrowings levels due to repayments made at the time of the sale of property 
other income 
other income increased to million in fiscal from none in fiscal the increase in other income resulted from the sale of a light industrial building in december by the company for million  net of selling expenses 
a gain  net of selling expenses  of million was recognized on the sale 
the related bank debt of million that was secured by the building was retired upon the closing of the building sale 
income taxes 
due to the losses incurred by the company in the current and prior years and the related net operating loss carryforwards available to the company  the company did not record income tax expense except for the minimum state income tax expense for fiscal and fiscal item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended march  and net revenues 
the company s net revenues decreased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in net revenues for fiscal reflected a significant decrease in demand  primarily by nortel  for the company s tdma  gsm and pcs cdma products 
cost of sales 
the company s cost of sales decreased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross margin on sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decline in gross margin for fiscal reflects reduced average selling prices on some of the company s amplifier products  transition costs associated with transferring the company s higher volume amplifier products to a contract manufacturer  costs associated with the underutilization of the company s wafer fabrication facility due to reduced shipment volume levels in fiscal  warranty costs associated with some of the company s older products and costs associated with higher excess and obsolete inventory levels due to reduced shipment demand 
research and development 
the company s r d expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in r d spending in fiscal reflected increased spending in both amplifier and semiconductor r d for personnel expenses and project development expenses 
r d expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to an increase in costs and a decrease in revenues 
selling  general and administrative 
the company s sg a expenses increased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to costs associated with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system and a new product data management system and additional ongoing infrastructure support and depreciation costs associated with these new systems 
these costs were offset slightly by reduced outside sales commissions due to the decline in revenue in fiscal interest income expense  net 
interest income  net for fiscal was million compared to net interest income of million for fiscal  reflecting slightly higher average cash and short term investment balances in fiscal as compared to fiscal other income  net 
in fiscal  no other expense or other income was recorded

segment information under the management approach  the company has broken down its business into two divisions based upon product type amplifier division and semiconductor division  which operates under the tradename of ultrarf 
ultrarf derives virtually all of its net revenues from sales to the amplifier division 
the company allocates operating expenses to these item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued segments but does not allocate interest income and expense 
corporate expenses are allocated to the operating segments based on predetermined annual allocation methods 
appropriate intersegment eliminations are made in the consolidation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company operated and reported its financial information as one vertical integrated unit in the fiscal year ending march  and therefore did not identify or report separate segment information 
the company began reporting its operations by segment as of the fiscal period beginning april  segment information for the year ended march  is as follows in thousands consolidated statement of operations data fiscal year ended march  amplifier ultrarf other total net revenues  external   net revenues  intersegment   amortization and depreciation     income loss before income taxes    recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

fin is effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december   or january  the company believes that fin will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its growth through sales of common stock  private sales of equity securities and divisions  capital equipment leases  bank lines of credit and cash flows from operations 
principal sources of liquidity at march  consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and bank borrowing arrangements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company has a revolving line of credit of million with a bank collateralized by the majority of the company s assets 
the line of credit expires on june  under the terms of the master agreement governing this credit instrument  the company is required to maintain certain minimum working capital  net worth  profitability and other specific financial ratios 
the master agreement also has certain restrictions on other indebtedness and the payment of dividends 
the company was in default of certain of the covenants and the bank has granted a waiver of the default effective through june  the company expects to be in default of a covenant at the end of the first quarter of fiscal the amount available to borrow at march  was million 
the company can borrow at either i a variable rate equal to the prime rate or ii a fixed rate equal to basis points above the libor rate  which at march  was and  respectively 
the company had no borrowings under the line of credit at march  in april  the company announced a repurchase program pursuant to which it could acquire up to one million shares of common stock in open market purchases 
the company repurchased a total of one million shares during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal on the open market for a total purchase price of million 
in january  the company borrowed million under a term loan secured by certain capital equipment 
the loan  which expires in january  requires the payment of monthly principal plus interest and is subject to certain minimum working capital  net worth and other specific financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with these covenants as of march  in april  the company entered into an operating lease for an ancillary  square foot engineering design center in quincy  illinois 
the lease was subsequently renewed for another years lease term that expires in april the company s working capital increased by million to million as of march  from million as of march  however  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by million during the same period 
the company s short term investments were principally invested in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
cash used by operations was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal cash used by operations in fiscal was principally the result of a million increase in inventory  which is partially a result of the timing difference between nortel s requested delivery dates and the company s vendor purchase commitments to support the customer s delivery requirements  a million increase in accounts receivable  which increased proportionately with revenue growth and also reflects the longer standard payment terms in europe  partially offset by an million increase in accounts payable  which increased proportionately with production levels 
in addition  accrued liabilities decreased by million due primarily to the reduction of warranty reserves based upon repairing defective products previously accrued for and the timing of the payment of certain expenses  primarily payroll related 
the company s investing activities used cash of approximately million during fiscal as compared to providing million of cash during fiscal cash used for investing activities during fiscal resulted primarily from million additions to property and equipment  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of a light industrial building by the company 
capital expenditures during fiscal included manufacturing test and production equipment required to support new products  test equipment to support various research and development projects  and the erp system 
the company s financing activities provided cash of approximately million during fiscal as compared to cash used of million during fiscal cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was the result of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock  through the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan activity  which was partially offset by million in repayments of debt and capital lease obligations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company anticipates spending approximately million over the next twelve months for capital additions primarily to support manufacturing production and test requirements  development projects and facilities expansion 
the company currently believes that its cash and equivalents  its line of credit  and funds from current and anticipated operations  will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
if the company acquires one or more businesses or products or divests existing businesses or product lines  the company s capital requirements could increase or decrease substantially 
to raise additional capital  the company may issue equity securities that could dilute existing investors 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results customer concentration  dependence on nortel 
the wireless infrastructure equipment market is dominated by a small number of large oems  including ericsson  lucent  motorola  nortel and siemens 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from sales to a limited number of these oems  in particular  nortel 
furthermore  a substantial portion of revenues from nortel in the past has resulted from sales of a limited number of the company s products 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations have been materially adversely affected in the past by anticipated orders failing to materialize and by deferrals or cancellations of orders as a result of changes in oem requirements 
the company and nortel have a supply agreement  renegotiated annually  pursuant to which nortel commits to purchase a certain volume of its annual power amplifier requirements for specified prices from the company 
this agreement allows nortel to change the product mix requirements  which can significantly affect the company s gross margins  and to change requested delivery dates without significant financial consequences to nortel  which affect the company s ability to efficiently manage production schedules and inventory levels and to accurately forecast product sales 
in september  the company announced that it expected that it would not be developing products for nortel but that it will continue to supply nortel with existing products 
there can be no assurance that nortel will purchase existing products from the company in the future or otherwise agree to purchase the same or similar levels of its power amplifier requirements from the company or purchase its power amplifier requirements at the same or similar pricing 
any reduction in the level of purchases of the company s amplifiers by nortel  or any material reduction in pricing without significant offsets  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the company s current or new customers do not generate sufficient demand for the company s new products replacing prior demand from nortel  the company s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
further  if the company were to lose nortel or any other major oem customer  or if orders by nortel or any other major oem customer were to otherwise materially decrease  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  wireless infrastructure equipment oems have come under increasing price pressure from wireless service providers  which in turn has resulted in downward pricing pressure on the company s products 
the company expects to incur increasing pricing pressures from nortel and other major oem customers in future periods  which could result in declining average sales prices and gross margins for the company s products 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued capacity constraints 
ultrarf s facilities have a level of capacity beyond which it cannot cost effectively produce its products 
although ultrarf is not currently approaching those constraints  it may be unable to further expand its business if it fails to plan and build sufficient capacity 
ultrarf may attempt to increase its capacity by converting its existing facility to accommodate equipment that uses six inch wafers 
ultrarf does not have any experience processing six inch wafers in ultrarf s fabrication facilities 
ultrarf may be required to redesign its processes and procedures substantially to accommodate the larger wafers 
as a result  implementing additional capacity for six inch wafers may take longer than planned  which could harm ultrarf s results of operations 
the process of converting to six inch wafers must begin substantially prior to receiving actual customer demand for products 
if the customer demand for products is not realized or implementation takes longer than planned  the results will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in operating results 
the company s quarterly and annual results have in the past been  and will continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations due to a number of factors  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  the company s results of operations are likely to vary due to the timing  cancellation  delay or rescheduling of oem customer orders and shipments  the timing of announcements or introductions of new products by the company  its competitors or their respective oem customers  the acceptance of such products by wireless equipment oems and their customers  relative variations in manufacturing efficiencies  yields and costs  competitive factors such as the pricing  availability  and demand for competing amplification products  changes in average sales prices and related gross margins which vary significantly based upon product mix  subcontractor performance  variations in operating expenses  changes in manufacturing capacity and variations in the utilization of this capacity  shortages of key supplies  the long sales cycles associated with the company s customer specific products  the timing and level of product and process development costs  changes in inventory levels  and the relative strength or weakness of international financial markets 
anticipated orders from the company s oem customers have in the past failed to materialize and delivery schedules have been deferred or canceled as a result of changes in oem customer requirements and the company expects this pattern to continue as customer requirements continue to change and industry standards continue to evolve 
reduced demand for wireless infrastructure equipment in the past has caused significant fluctuations in the company s product sales 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such fluctuations in the future 
the company does not believe that it will have the annual revenue growth it experienced in fiscal  in the future  if at all 
the company establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on its expected revenues  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  variations in timing of revenues can cause significant variations in quarterly results of operations 
there can be no assurance that item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company will be profitable on a quarter to quarter basis in the future 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
due to all the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters the company s revenues or operating results will not meet the expectations of public stock market analysts or investors 
in such event  the market price of the company s common stock would be materially adversely affected 
declining average sales prices 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  declining average sales prices for its products 
wireless infrastructure equipment manufacturers have come under increasing price pressure from wireless service providers  which in turn has resulted in downward pricing pressure on the company s products 
in addition  competition has increased the downward pricing pressure on the company s products 
since wireless infrastructure equipment manufacturers frequently negotiate supply arrangements far in advance of delivery dates  the company often must commit to price reductions for its products before it is aware of how  or if  cost reductions can be obtained 
to offset declining average sales prices  the company believes that it must achieve manufacturing cost reductions 
if the company is unable to achieve such cost reductions  the company s gross margins will decline  and such decline will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product quality  performance and reliability 
the company expects that its customers will continue to establish demanding specifications for quality  performance and reliability that must be met by the company s products 
power amplifiers as complex as those offered by the company often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures 
the company has from time to time in the past experienced product quality  performance or reliability problems 
in addition  multicarrier power amplifiers have a higher probability of malfunction than single carrier power amplifiers because of their greater complexity 
there can be no assurance that defects or failures relating to the company s product quality  performance and reliability will not occur in the future that may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
internal amplifier design and production capabilities of oems 
the company believes that a majority of the present worldwide production of power amplifiers is captive within the manufacturing operations of wireless equipment oems  many of which have chosen not to purchase amplifiers from outside suppliers 
in addition  these manufacturers could decide to sell amplifiers to other wireless equipment oems 
if this should occur  the competition for power amplifiers would significantly increase and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also believes that those oems that purchase from third party amplifier vendors are reluctant to switch once committed to a particular merchant vendor 
consequently  the company has only limited opportunities to increase revenues by replacing internal oem amplifier production or displacing other merchant amplifier suppliers 
moreover  given the limited opportunities for merchant power amplifier suppliers  any decision by an oem to employ a second source merchant supplier for a product currently purchased from a merchant supplier may reduce the existing merchant supplier s ability to maintain a given level of product sales to such oem or  possibly  to retain the oem as a customer due to price competition from the second source merchant supplier 
there can be no assurance that the company s major oem customers will continue to rely  or increase their reliance  on the company as an external source of supply for their power amplifiers  or that other wireless equipment oems will become customers of the company 
if the major wireless infrastructure equipment suppliers do not purchase or continue to purchase their power amplifiers from merchant suppliers  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  dependence on new products 
the markets in which the company and its oem customers compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products and services 
in particular  because the company s strategy of rapidly bringing to market products customized for numerous and evolving modulation standards requires developing and achieving volume production of a large number of distinct products  the company s ability to rapidly design and produce individual products for which there is significant oem customer demand will be a critical determinant of the company s future success 
a softening of demand in the markets served by the company or a failure of modulation standard in which the company has invested substantial development resources may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that the company s product development efforts will be successful  that its new products will meet customer requirements and be accepted or that its oem customers product offerings will achieve customer acceptance 
if a significant number of development projects  including the company s new multicarrier products  do not result in substantial volume production or if technologies or standards supported by the company s or its customers products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance  the company s business may be materially adversely affected 
risks associated with internal wafer and device fabrication 
the company s operation of its wafer and device fabrication facilities entails a number of risks  including a high level of fixed and variable costs  the management of complex processes  dependence on a single source of supply for certain components and services  and a strict regulatory environment 
during periods of low demand  high fixed wafer fabrication costs are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the design and fabrication of rf semiconductors is a complex and precise process 
such manufacturing is sensitive to a wide variety of factors  including variations and impurities in the raw materials  quality control of the packages  difficulties in the fabrication process  performance of the manufacturing equipment  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer and the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment 
as a result of these and other factors  semiconductor manufacturing yields from time to time in the past have suffered  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve acceptable production yields in the future 
in addition  the company s wafer and device fabrication facility represents a single point of failure in its manufacturing process that would be costly and time consuming to replace if its operation were interrupted 
the interruption of wafer fabrication operations  the loss of key employees dedicated to the wafer and device fabrication facilities  or any failure to maintain acceptable wafer and device production levels could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ultrarf s business could be adversely affected by its failure to develop and market its ldmos rf power transistors competitively 
ultrarf is developing and refining its ldmos rf power transistor technology to address current and emerging wireless voice and data air interface standards 
ultrarf sells its products in an industry characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
ultrarf can provide no assurance that its development efforts will result in commercially successful ldmos products in a timely or cost effective manner  if at all 
ultrarf s competitors are also expected to develop and sell devices suitable for these markets and may produce devices with superior performance to ultrarf s planned developments 
failure by ultrarf to develop competitive devices could adversely affect its business 
ultrarf s close relationship with spectrian could limit ultrarf s potential to do business with spectrian s competitors 
spectrian currently is ultrarf s largest customer  and ultrarf expects to have a variety of ongoing contractual relationships with spectrian 
ultrarf cannot predict whether existing or potential customers who are competitors of spectrian will be deterred by the existence of such a item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued relationship between spectrian and ultrarf 
if they are deterred  ultrarf s future growth could be hindered 
sole or limited sources of materials and services 
the company currently procures from single sources certain components and services for its products including  but not limited to  turnkey amplifier assemblies and specialized components 
the company purchases these products  components and services on a purchase order basis  does not carry significant inventories of these components and does not have any long term supply contracts with its sole source vendors 
furthermore  the company began outsourcing assembly of some of its higher volume power amplifiers during the third fiscal quarter of and will transfer the remaining power amplifier production during fiscal to a contract manufacturer 
the company issues non cancelable purchase orders to the contract manufacturer days in advance of requested delivery which is greater than the committed delivery schedule of some of its customers  such as nortel 
the company s reliance on sole sources for certain components and its migration to an outsourced  turnkey manufacturing strategy entail certain risks including reduced control over the price  timely delivery  reliability and quality of the components 
if the company were to change any of its sole source vendors or contract manufacturers  the company would be required to requalify the components with each new vendor or contract manufacturer  respectively 
any inability of the company to obtain timely deliveries of components or assembled amplifiers of acceptable quality in required quantities or a significant increase in the prices of components for which the company does not have alternative sources could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has occasionally experienced difficulties in obtaining some components  and no assurance can be given that shortages will not occur in the future 
risks of international sales 
the company operates in an international market and expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of the company s total revenues for the foreseeable future 
these sales involve a number of inherent risks  including imposition of government controls  currency exchange fluctuations  potential insolvency of international distributors  representatives and customers  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  the impact of recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  political instability and generally longer receivables collection periods  as well as tariffs and other trade barriers 
in addition  because substantially all of the company s foreign sales are denominated in us dollars  increases in the value of the dollar relative to the local currency would increase the price of the company s products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more expensive and less price competitive than competitors products that are priced in local currencies 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company anticipates that turmoil in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in certain countries where the company has significant sales  such as south korea  may have an impact on its sales to customers located in or whose projects are based in those countries due to the impact of currency fluctuations on the relative price of the company s products and restrictions on government spending imposed by the international monetary fund the imf on those countries receiving the imf s assistance 
in addition  customers in those countries may face reduced access to working capital to fund component purchases  such as the company s products  due to higher interest rates  reduced funding of wireless infrastructure by domestic governments  reduced bank lending due to contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customer s or its bank s financial condition or the inability to access equity financing 
a substantial majority of the company s products are sold to oems who incorporate the company s products into systems sold and installed to end user customers 
these oems are not required by contract and do not typically provide the company with information regarding the location and identity of their end user customers  and  therefore  the company is not able to determine what portion of its product sales have been or future orders will be incorporated into oem item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sales to end users in countries experiencing financial market turmoil and or deterioration of economic conditions 
furthermore  a large portion of the company s existing customers and potential new customers are servicing new markets in developing countries that the company s customers expect will deploy wireless communication networks as an alternative to the construction of a wireline infrastructure 
if such countries decline to construct wireless communication systems  or construction of such systems is delayed for any reason  including business and economic conditions and changes in economic stability due to factors such as increased inflation and political turmoil  such delays could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance upon growth of wireless services 
sales of power amplifiers to wireless infrastructure equipment suppliers have in the past accounted  and are expected in the future to account  for substantially all of the company s product sales 
demand for wireless infrastructure equipment is driven by demand for wireless service 
although demand for power amplifiers has grown in recent years  if demand for wireless services fails to increase or increases more slowly than the company or its oem customers currently anticipate  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
market for the company s products is highly competitive 
the wireless communications equipment industry is extremely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  new product development and product obsolescence  evolving industry standards and significant price erosion over the life of a product 
the ability of the company to compete successfully and sustain profitability depends in part upon the rates at which wireless equipment oems incorporate the company s products into their systems and the company captures market share from other merchant suppliers 
the company s major oem customers continuously evaluate whether to manufacture their own amplification products or purchase them from outside sources 
there can be no assurance that these oem customers will incorporate the company s products into their systems or that in general they will continue to rely  or expand their reliance  on external sources of supply for their power amplifiers 
these customers and other large manufacturers of wireless communications equipment could also elect to enter the merchant market and compete directly with the company  and at least one oem  nec  has already done so 
such increased competition could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s principal competitors in the market for wireless amplification products provided by merchant suppliers currently include aml communications  amplidyne  microwave power devices  nec and powerwave technologies 
no assurance can be given that the company s competitors will not develop new technologies or enhancements to existing products or introduce new products that will offer superior price or performance features compared to the company s products 
uncertain protection of intellectual property 
the company s ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend  in part  on its ability to protect its proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others 
the company has a policy of seeking patents on inventions resulting from its ongoing research and development activities 
there can be no assurance that the company s pending patent applications will be allowed or that the issued or pending patents will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors 
notwithstanding the company s active pursuit of patent protection  the company believes that the success of its business depends more on the collective value of its patents  specifications  computer aided design and modeling tools  technical processes and employee expertise 
the company generally enters into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with its employees  suppliers  oem customers  and potential customers and limits access to and distribution of its proprietary technology 
however  there can be no assurance that such measures will provide adequate protection for the company s trade secrets or other proprietary information  or that the company s trade item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued secrets or proprietary technology will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary technology could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of third party claims of infringement 
the communications equipment industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
although there is currently no pending intellectual property litigation against the company  the company or its suppliers may from time to time be notified of claims that the company may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
if it is necessary or desirable  the company may seek licenses under such patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  there can be no assurance that licenses will be offered or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to the company 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by the company or otherwise secure rights to use such technology could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  to suspend the manufacture of products or expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in such development or that such licenses would be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
in the event that any third party makes a successful claim against the company or its customers and either a license is not made available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or a design around is not practicable  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to establish the validity of the company s proprietary rights 
litigation by or against the company could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a favorable determination for the company 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  indemnify its customers  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
government regulation of communications industry 
radio frequency transmissions and emissions  and certain equipment used in connection therewith are regulated in the united states  canada and throughout the rest of the world 
regulatory approvals generally must be obtained by the company in connection with the manufacture and sale of its products  and by wireless service providers to operate the company s products 
the united states federal communications commission the fcc and regulatory authorities abroad constantly review rf emission issues and promulgate standards based on such reviews 
if more stringent rf emission regulations are adopted  the company and its oem customers may be required to alter the manner in which radio signals are transmitted or otherwise alter the equipment transmitting such signals  which could materially adversely affect the company s products and markets 
the enactment by federal  state  local or international governments of new laws or regulations or a change in the interpretation of existing regulations could also materially adversely affect the market for the company s products 
although deregulation of international communications industries along with radio frequency spectrum allocations made by the fcc have increased the potential demand for the company s products by providing users of those products with opportunities to establish new wireless personal communications services  there can be no assurance that the trend toward deregulation and current regulatory developments favorable to the promotion of new and expanded personal communications services will continue or that other future regulatory changes will have a positive impact on the company 
the increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for such products  generally following extensive investigation of and deliberation over competing technologies 
the delays inherent in this governmental approval process have in the past caused  and may in the future cause  the cancellation  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by the company s oem customers 
these delays have had in the past  and in the future may have  a material adverse effect on the sale of products by the company to such oem customers 
environmental regulations 
the company is subject to a variety of local  state and federal governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture the company s products 
the company believes that it is currently in compliance in all material respects with such regulations and that it has obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct its business 
nevertheless  the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines on the company  suspension of production  alteration of its manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
compliance with such regulations could require the company to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses 
any failure by the company to control the use  disposal  removal or storage of  or to adequately restrict the discharge of  or assist in the cleanup of  hazardous or toxic substances  could subject the company to significant liabilities  including joint and several liabilities under certain statutes 
the imposition of such liabilities could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth  dependence on key personnel 
the company s business and growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s personnel  management and other resources 
the company s ability to manage any future growth effectively will require it to attract  motivate  manage and retain new employees successfully  especially in the highly competitive northern california job market  to integrate new employees into its overall operations and to retain the continued service of its key technical  marketing and management personnel  and to continue to improve its operational  financial and management information systems 
although the company has employment contracts with several of its executive officers  these agreements do not obligate such individuals to remain in the employment of the company 
the company does not maintain key person life insurance on any of its key technical personnel 
the competition for such personnel is intense 
the company has experienced loss of key employees in the past and could in the future 
such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company 
on march   the company employed mr 
thomas h 
waechter as its president and chief executive officer 
there can be no assurance that mr 
waechter will operate effectively with existing management nor that he will be able to retain or attract additional executive officers as needed 
as a result of the plan to discontinue manufacturing operations in sunnyvale  california  and the related restructuring  several key executives will cease to be employees of the company 
the company s ability to manage its growth will require it to continue to invest in its operational  financial and management information systems  procedures and controls 
we can give no assurance that the company will be able to manage its growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may  from time to time  pursue the acquisition of other companies  assets or product lines that complement or expand its existing business 
the company may also  from time to time  pursue divestitures of existing operations 
acquisitions and divestitures involve a number of risks that could adversely affect the company s operating results 
these risks include the diversion of management s attention from day to day business  the difficulty of combining and assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  charges to the company s earnings as a result of the purchase of intangible assets  and the potential loss of key employees as a result of an acquisition 
should any acquisition take place  we can give no assurance that this acquisition will not materially and adversely affect the company or that any such acquisition will enhance the company s business 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued volatility of stock price 
the market price of the shares of common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile  and is affected significantly by factors such as fluctuations in the company s quarterly and annual operating results  customer concentration  the timing difference between nortel s requested delivery dates and its vendor purchase commitments to support the customer s delivery requirements  reliance on international markets  the absence of the economies of scale achieved by some of its competitors  announcements of technological innovations  new customer contracts or new products by the company or its competitors  announcements by the company s customers regarding their business or prospects  changes in analysts expectations  estimates and recommendations  news reports regarding the company  its competitors and its markets  governmental regulatory action  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  announcements of significant acquisitions or strategic partnerships by the company or its competitors  announcements of significant divestitures of existing businesses or product lines  general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for power amplifier manufacturers in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that is often unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of the company s common stock  regardless of actual operating performance 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past 
legal proceedings 
on may   the company announced that it had reached a settlement in principle of the shareholder class action lawsuits which were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california and the superior court of the state of california for santa clara county 
the terms of the settlement will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results from operations 
the final settlement agreement is subject to court approval and class notice provisions 
shareholder rights plan  issuance of preferred stock 
the board of directors of the company adopted a shareholder rights plan in october the rights plan 
pursuant to the rights plan  the board declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right per share of common stock the rights and each such right has an exercise price of 
the rights become exercisable upon the occurrence of certain events  including the announcement of a tender offer or exchange offer for the company s common stock or the acquisition of a specified percentage of the company s common stock by a third party 
the exercise of the rights could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of the company s common stock 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock 
the board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the powers  preferences and rights and the qualifications  limitations or item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of undesignated preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series  without any further vote or action by the company s stockholders 
for example  in connection with the company s shareholder rights plan  the board of directors designated  shares of preferred stock as series a participating preferred stock although none of such shares have been issued 
the preferred stock could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to those of the holders of common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
year readiness many installed computer programs were written using a two digit date field rather than a four digit field to define the applicable year 
such computer programs utilizing a two digit date field may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the year issue 
to date  the company has not experienced disruptions in its business related to the year issue 
however  the company cannot provide any assurance that no year issues will impact its systems  products or other aspects of its business in the future 
the company has taken steps to address the year issue in the following three areas the company s internal systems  the company s products and the company s suppliers 
all of the company s networks  desktops  application servers  operating systems and an enterprise wide computer software system have been found compliant  have been replaced or remediation has been completed 
until recently the company s products did not contain embedded systems to which year compliance would be necessary 
the company s latest multicarrier product does include date stamp functionality and has been determined to be year compliant 
all of the new products are being manufactured using only hardware  software  or firmware that is currently year compliant 
the company believes that any future disruptions to its business from the year issue could have a material impact on operating expenses  but that the effect on revenues would not be material 
substantially all necessary remedial work was completed by the end of december in addition  certain of the materials and supplies critical to production and delivery of the company s products are furnished by a limited number of suppliers  and in some cases a sole supplier 
key suppliers to the company and its contract manufacturer have not experienced disruptions in their business related to the year issue 
however  the company cannot provide any assurance that no year issue will effect its suppliers or contract manufacturer in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company develops products in the united states and markets its products in north america  europe and the asia pacific region 
thus  the financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as all sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make the company s products less competitive in foreign markets
