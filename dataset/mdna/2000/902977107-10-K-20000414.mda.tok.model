item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements certain information contained in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
although the company believes that expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved 
forward looking information is subject to certain risks  trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
such risks  trends and uncertainties include the highly cyclical nature of the forest products industry  general economic conditions  competition  price conditions or trends for the company s products  the possibility that timber supply could increase if governmental  environmental or endangered species policies change  and limitations on the company s ability to harvest its timber due to adverse natural conditions or increased governmental restrictions 
the results of the company s operations and its ability to pay quarterly distributions to its unitholders depend upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond its control 
these factors include general economic and industry conditions  domestic and export prices  supply and demand for logs  seasonality  government regulations affecting the manner in which timber may be harvested  and competition from other supplying regions and substitute products 
these and other risks are described in the company s other reports and registration statements  which are available from the united states securities and exchange commission 
general the company s primary business is the growing and harvesting of timber see item business 
the company s results of operations are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond its control  including general industry conditions  domestic and international prices and supply and demand for logs  lumber and other wood products  seasonality and competition from other domestic and international supplying regions and substitute products 
supply and demand factors supply the supply of logs available for purchase has been most affected in recent years by significant reductions in timber harvested from public timberlands  principally as a result of efforts to preserve the habitat of certain endangered species  as well as a change in the emphasis of government policy toward habitat preservation  conservation and recreation and away from timber management 
since the early s  environmental and other similar concerns and governmental policies have substantially reduced the volume of timber under contract to be harvested from public lands 
the pace of regulatory activity accelerated in the late s 
the resulting supply decrease caused prices for logs to increase significantly  reaching peak levels during although prices have declined from these record levels  current prices still exceed pre levels 
the low supply of timber from public lands  which is expected to continue for the foreseeable future  has benefited private timber holders such as the company through higher stumpage and log prices 
industry participants do not expect environmental restrictions to ease materially within any reasonable planning horizon 
consequently  many producers of lumber and wood products are attempting to adapt to the new supply environment by increasing their emphasis on raw material yields  entering into long term timber supply arrangements and value added manufacturing  and accessing previously untapped supplies such as private wood lot owners  timber with difficult access  alternative species and imports 
these factors have tended to restrict prices from even greater increases 
while raw material supply is expected to be an ongoing challenge for the lumber and wood products industry  such conditions are likely to cause the favorable operating environment for timber owners such as the company to continue for the foreseeable future 
in response to an increase in timber prices in the early s  imports of logs and lumber from abroad from countries such as canada and new zealand increased 
these imports  however  only partially offset the lost volume of timber from public timberlands and did not replace the mature  high quality timber found in greater quantities on public timberlands 
since  log imports have decreased and their current impact on timber prices is minimal 
however  pine lumber imports almost doubled in the same period 
demand changes in general economic and demographic factors  including the strength of the economy and interest rates for home mortgages and construction loans  have historically caused fluctuations in housing starts and  in turn  demand and prices for lumber and commodity wood products 
united states housing starts for were at the highest level since because of the growth of the home center distribution business  the repair and remodeling markets have become a significant factor in terms of the demand for lumber and commodity wood products and have dampened the wide fluctuations that occurred when new housing starts were the primary factor 
a large portion of the company s property consists of pine species  which are used in the finishing market  for molding trim  doors and windows 
this market is more affected by repair and remodeling than new housing construction 
prices for these species  primarily ponderosa pine  reached a peak in the spring of and as a result attracted imports of radiata pine from new zealand and chile 
domestic markets have absorbed the increasing quantities of imported radiata pine lumber  and the result has been relatively stable pricing for ponderosa pine lumber 
the demand for logs in the united states is also affected by the level of lumber imports 
in response to increasing lumber imports from canada  the united states and canada signed an agreement in which restricts the availability of canadian softwood lumber in the united states 
the company believes that this agreement has not had a material impact on the price or demand for logs in the united states although its long term effect is uncertain 
due to transportation costs  domestic conversion facilities in the pacific northwest tend to purchase raw materials within relatively confined geographic areas  generally within a mile radius 
the conversion facilities in the vicinity of the timberlands need more wood supply to run at capacity than can be produced by nearby timberlands 
as a result  the demand from this region is relatively steady  although prices fluctuate with market conditions 
current market conditions log prices in the northwest generally improved in as compared to due to the robust united states economy and supply and demand factors 
in the united states economy continued to enjoy economic expansion 
low mortgage interest rates created favorable conditions for new home construction  home repair and remodeling  and industrial and other construction  which strengthened the demand for finished lumber and plywood products  resulting in increased demand for the company s logs and timber 
the supply of logs in the pacific northwest continued to tighten in due to increased export activity due to a gradual recovery of asian markets  the reduction of canadian deliveries due to an agreement between the united states and canada signed in restricting the availability of canadian softwood lumber in the united states  weather conditions and continued legal and governmental pressures on the availability of timber on public timberlands 
the gradual recovery of asian markets has led to an increased level of log exports  reducing the supply of logs available to domestic markets 
dry weather conditions during created extreme fire conditions  resulting in reduced wood deliveries for most of the summer 
in late  a us district court judge issued an injunction against the us forest service usfs  requiring the usfs to put on hold planned timber sales totaling million board feet 
the supply from public timberlands was further threatened in the fall of when the clinton administration presented an initiative that would more than double the approximately million acres of federal lands that are already protected as wilderness 
strong economic factors combined with increasing demand and decreasing supply resulted in strong prices for finished wood products 
composite indices for commodity lumber and plywood prices were higher in as compared to the combination of the declining log supply and increased demand for finished wood products  generally pushed log prices higher in as compared to during  the company s average delivered log price for ponderosa pine was consistent with the company s average delivered log prices for lodgepole pine  douglas fir  and white fir  however  were higher in than in by  and  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth sales volume for each of  and from the sale of logs  stumpage and timber deeds by thousand board feet mbf and price per thousand board feet and the sales of property

revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in timber deed sales of million and a million increase in log sales  partially offset by a million reduction in stumpage sales  a million decrease in by products and other revenues and the fact that the company had no land sales in compared to approximately million in land sales in to meet its working capital requirements  the company harvested and sold logs and stumpage in at rates in excess of both levels and the estimated current annual board footage growth on the timberlands 
timber deed sales for were million on volumes of  mbf  compared to no timber deed revenue for log sales for were million on volumes of  mbf  compared to log sales of million on volumes of  mbf in the average log sales price per mbf for was compared to an average log sales price per mbf of for  a increase  reflecting stronger markets  primarily for white fir and douglas fir logs 
stumpage sales for were million on volumes of  mbf  compared with stumpage sales of million on volumes on  mbf in the average stumpage sales price per mbf for was compared to an average stumpage sales price per mbf of for  a reduction 
the decrease in average stumpage sales prices from to was primarily due to a reduction in the grade of timber harvestedfrom the ochoco timberlands 
the overall reduction in stumpage sales volume is due to the increased use of timber deed sales in the company had no revenue from timber and property sales during as compared to approximately million in planned timber and property sales during gross profit 
gross profit increased by million from million in to million in and gross margin increased from in to in the increase in gross margin was primarily from three factors 
first  the company s normal annual review of its standing timber inventory and depletion rate during the first quarter of resulted in a reduction of the company s depletion rate  and a savings of approximately million in also  the company did not have any land sales during  which have typically resulted in lower margins than log  stumpage and deed sales 
in addition to the above items  the company benefited from an overall increase in log prices during selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million from million in to million in this expense also decreased as a percentage of net sales from in to in the decrease was primarily attributable to one time expenses of million related to severance costs and the repurchase of member interests in the general partner that were incurred during the first and fourth quarters of  combined with the provision in for the closure of the seattle office 
interest expense 
interest expense for was million as compared to million for  representing a million or reduction 
interest expense for both and was incurred primarily on the million of notes issued in the november public note offering 
the slight decrease in interest expense in can be attributed to a reduced level of borrowing against the available revolving credit facilities during as compared to interest income 
interest income for was million  an increase of million or from interest income for of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to imputed interest from deed sales with a term of more than one year 
imputed interest income from deed sales was approximately million in the increase in interest from timber deed sales was partially offset by a reduction in the cash and cash equivalents available in compared to other income expense  net 
other income  net  was million for compared to other expense  net  of million for  representing an increase to income of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to a mark to market gain on an interest rate collar of approximately million during in addition  revenues from land use management operations such as grazing permits increased in cash flow from operations 
during  cash flow from operations increased million or primarily as a result of increased gross margins and a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses  offset partially by decreased proceeds from timber and property sales  increase in balance of notes receivable and a decrease in accrued liabilities 
partners capital during the limited partner interest in the company declined million from million to million 
this decline was the result of distributions to unitholders of million during partially offset by the limited partner s share of the company s net income of in the general partner interest in the company also declined during reflecting its share of the company s distributions and net income for the company currently expects to continue making distributions to unitholders 
as a result  the company anticipates that partners capital will continue to decline 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues were million in  a decrease of million or from revenues of million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a million reduction in timber and property sales  a million reduction in log sales and a million reduction in by products and other revenues  partially offset by a million increase in revenues from stumpage sales 
to meet its working capital requirements  the company harvested and sold logs and stumpage in at rates in excess of both levels and the estimated current annual board footage growth on the timberlands 
revenue from planned timber and property sales decreased to million in from million during  representing a million or reduction 
the significant reduction was due to a decrease in the volume contained in the timber and property sales of  mbf as compared to  mbf in log sales for were million on volumes of  mbf  compared to log sales of million on volumes of  mbf in the average log sales price per mbf for was compared to an average log sales price per mbf of for  a reduction  reflecting weaker markets  primarily for ponderosa pine logs 
stumpage sales for were million on volumes of  mbf  compared with stumpage sales of million on volumes of  mbf in the average stumpage sales price per mbf for was compared to an average stumpage sales price per mbf of for  a reduction 
the decrease in average stumpage sales prices from to was primarily due to a reduction in the grade of timber harvested from the ochoco timberlands 
in addition  the company entered into six stumpage contracts in for an aggregate estimated revenue of million and  mbf 
the revenue from these six contracts was recognized in gross profit 
gross profit decreased by million from million in to million in and the gross margin decreased from in to in the decrease is primarily attributable to a lower margin on timber and property sales in of compared to in combined with an increase in depletion  depreciation and amortization expense during of million from depletion  depreciation and amortization expense was million in  a million or increase over million in this increase was primarily attributable to a net increase in log and stumpage sales volumes and an increase in the company s depletion rate per mbf  which resulted from the ochoco timberlands acquisition in july selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  an increase of million or over comparable expenses of million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to one time expenses of million related to severance costs and the repurchase of member interests in the general partner that were incurred in the first and fourth quarters of  combined with increased costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company  and implementing the company s strategy to pursue accretive acquisitions of timberland 
interest expense 
interest expense for was million as compared to million for  representing a million or reduction 
interest expense was incurred primarily on the million of notes issued in the november public note offering 
interest expense related primarily to million of term debt and million of revolving debt incurred in connection with the weyerhaeuser acquisition on august  and million of incremental debt incurred in connection with the ochoco acquisition on july  the reduction in interest expense is primarily attributable to the use of a substantial portion of the proceeds from the company s initial offering completed on november   to retire outstanding debt 
amortization of deferred financing fees and debt guarantee fees 
the company deferred million of fees incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes 
these fees will be amortized over the term of the notes  which are due in november the amortization of these fees during was million 
during the company recognized million of expense related to debt guarantee fees and amortization of deferred financing fees 
interest income 
interest income for was million  a decrease of million or from interest income for of million 
the reduction in interest income is primarily attributable to the reduction in the cash and cash equivalents available in compared to other expense  net 
other expense  net was million for compared to million for  representing a reduction of million or extraordinary items 
during the company refinanced certain long term borrowings resulting in extraordinary losses on extinguishment of debt of million due to the write off of existing unamortized deferred financing fees and other related fees 
cash flow from operations 
during  cash flow from operations decreased million or primarily as a result of decreased proceeds from timber and property sales  an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and a decrease of advance payments on stumpage sales contracts 
partners capital during the limited partner interest in the company declined million from million to million 
this decline is the result of the limited partner s share of the company s net loss and distributions to unitholders during  which were million and million  respectively 
the general partner interest in the company also declined during reflecting its share of the company s net loss and distributions for the company currently expects to continue to incur operating losses and make distributions to its unitholders 
as a result  the company anticipates that partners capital will continue to decline 
liquidity and capital resources effective november   the company completed its initial offering of  common units including common units issued upon the exercise by the underwriter s of their over allotment option in december 
net proceeds from the initial offering were million 
in addition  the operating company issued million of notes in the public notes offering 
the proceeds from the initial offering and the public notes offering were primarily utilized to retire all outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million of term debt 
for purposes of this discussion  these transactions are hereafter referred to as the transactions 
as of december   the company had a cash balance of million and million of working capital 
operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities in were million  as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million in the million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to a million increase in net income offset by a million increase in notes receivable related to timber deed sales and the addback of non cash operating items 
investing activities 
cash flows used by investing activities were million in  as compared to cash flows used by investing activities of million during the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in the amount invested in timber and road additions during compared to as well as a million investment in affiliate that was made during financing activities 
cash flows used in financing activities were million in  as compared to cash flows used by financing activities of million during during  the company paid million in distributions to unitholders and minority interest 
during  the company paid million to unitholders and minority interest and paid million to an affiliate for redemption of a certain member s interest 
notes on november   the operating company issued million aggregate principal amount of notes the notes representing unsecured general obligations of the operating company which bear interest at per annum  payable semiannually in arrears on may and november the notes mature on november  unless previously redeemed 
the notes will not require any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments prior to maturity and are redeemable at the option of the operating company in whole or in part  on or after november  at predetermined redemption prices plus accrued interest to the redemption date 
in addition  at any time on or prior to november   the operating company  at its option  may redeem the notes with the net cash proceeds of a common units offering or other equity interests of the company  at of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date  provided that at least of the principal amount of the notes originally issued remain outstanding immediately following such redemption 
upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as defined in the indenture  the company must offer to purchase the notes  at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase 
the indenture governing the notes the indenture contains various affirmative and restrictive covenants applicable to the operating company and its subsidiaries  including limitations on the ability of the operating company and its subsidiaries to  among other things  i incur additional indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness unless the operating company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture is greater than to  and ii make distributions to the company  make investments other than permitted investments in any person  create liens  engage in transactions with affiliates  suffer to exist any restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to make distributions or repay indebtedness to the company  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  enter into a merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets  sell assets or harvest timber in excess of certain limitations or engage in a different line of business 
under the indenture  the operating company will be permitted to make cash distributions to the company so long as no default or event of default exists or would exist upon making such distribution a if the operating company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture is greater than to  in an amount  in any quarter  equal to available cash as defined in the indenture for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter or b if the operating company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is equal to or less than to  in an aggregate amount after the closing of this offering not to exceed i million less the aggregate of all restricted payments made under this clause b i during the immediately preceding fiscal quarters or shorter period  if applicable  beginning on the issue date of the notes  plus ii the net proceeds of certain capital contributions including the sale of units received by the company 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at december  and affiliate credit facility during the second quarter of  the company replaced an existing bank credit facility through a credit agreement with an affiliate of the general partner affiliate credit facility 
the affiliate credit facility allows the company to borrow up to million under certain terms and covenants 
the covenants include restrictions on the company s ability to make cash distributions  incur certain additional indebtedness or incur certain liens 
in addition  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios 
the affiliate credit facility will expire on june  at that time  amounts borrowed will be due and payable 
as of december  there were no outstanding borrowings under the affiliate credit facility 
the company s intent is to replace the affiliate credit facility with a bank facility sometime during the first half of the company also has the ability to generate cash flow through the acceleration of planned log and timber deed sales 
in addition  the company s plan is to use investment and commercial banks to raise funds for acquisitions 
under the affiliate credit facility  so long as no event of default as defined in the affiliate credit facility exists or would result  the operating company will be permitted to make quarterly cash distributions to the company in an amount not to exceed available cash as defined in the affiliate credit facility in the preceding quarterly period 
capital expenditures cash distributions capital expenditures in totaled million 
capital expenditures incurred were mainly in the nature of land management silvicultural expenses  miscellaneous equipment and computer hardware and software 
capital expenditures were financed through cash flow generated by operations 
as the company does not currently own and does not plan to own manufacturing facilities  and all logging is subcontracted to third parties  it is anticipated that capital expenditures in the future will not be significant and will consist mainly of land management silvicultural expenditures 
it is currently anticipated that the company will not maintain significant log inventories  although small log inventories may be maintained for a short period of time  or incur material capital expenditures for machinery and equipment 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures will be approximately million in capital expenditures will consist primarily of capitalized silvicultural costs and miscellaneous equipment purchases 
cash required to meet the company s debt service and quarterly cash distributions will be significant 
to meet its working capital requirements  the company has been selling logs and making timber sales at a rate in excess of the general partner s estimate of the current annual board footage growth on the company s timberlands 
the general partner expects that the debt service and quarterly cash distributions will be funded from operations and borrowings 
given projected volumes for sales of logs and timber  estimated current board footage growth on the timberlands and the harvest restrictions in the notes  unless prices improve  costs are reduced  new markets are developed or the company makes accretive acquisitions  the company s ability in the future to make distributions at current levels may be adversely affected 
the company continues to evaluate means to improve cash flows  including the factors mentioned above 
however  there can be no assurance that prices will improve or that the company will be able to take any of these actions 
effects of inflation prices for the company s stumpage and logs may be subject to sharp cyclical fluctuations due to market or other economic conditions  including the level of construction activity but generally do not directly follow inflationary trends 
costs of forest operations and general and administrative expenses generally reflect inflationary trends 
year compliance the company has completed its year readiness work and did not experience disruption in its business related to the year issue 
in addition to internally assessing its systems and business for year  the company contacted all major external third parties that provide products and services to the company to assess their readiness for year the company made certain investments in systems  applications and products to address the year issues 
the company did not  however  track internal resources dedicated to the resolution of the year issue and therefore  is unable to quantify internal costs incurred to date that are associated with the year issue 
the company believes that direct and indirect expenditures to address the year issue were immaterial to the company s operations 
to date  the company has not experienced any significant  known year issues and has been informed by material third parties that they have also not experienced material year issues 
the company will continue to monitor any on going year issues
