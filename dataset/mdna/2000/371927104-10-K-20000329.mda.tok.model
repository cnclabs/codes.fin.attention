item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following review of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations selected financial data for this discussion of the results of operations follows  in thousands 
years ended december  revenues gathering marketing    pipeline    gross margin gathering marketing    pipeline    general and administrative expenses    depreciation and amortization    operating income    interest income expense  net  other income expense the profitability of genesis depends to a significant extent upon its ability to maximize gross margin 
the gross margin from gathering and marketing operations is generated by the difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  minus the associated costs of aggregation and transportation 
in addition to purchasing crude oil at the wellhead  genesis purchases crude oil in bulk at major pipeline terminal points and enters into exchange transactions with third parties 
these bulk and exchange transactions are characterized by large volumes and narrow profit margins on purchase and sales transactions  and the absolute price levels for crude oil do not necessarily bear a relationship to gross margin  although such price levels significantly impact revenues and cost of sales 
because period to period variations in revenues and cost of sales are not generally meaningful in analyzing the variation in gross margin for gathering and marketing operations  such changes are not addressed in the following discussion 
pipeline revenues and gross margins are primarily a function of the level of throughput and storage activity and are generated by the difference between the regulated published tariff and the fixed and variable costs of operating the pipeline 
changes in revenues  volumes and pipeline operating costs  therefore  are relevant to the analysis of financial results of genesis pipeline operations and are addressed in the following discussion of pipeline operations of genesis 
gross margin from gathering  marketing and pipeline operations varies from period to period  depending to a significant extent upon changes in the supply and demand of crude oil and the resulting changes in us crude oil inventory levels 
in general  gathering and marketing gross margin increases when crude oil inventories decline  resulting in crude oil for prompt generally the next month delivery being priced at an increased premium over crude oil for future delivery 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  gross margin 
gathering and marketing gross margins decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decline in gross margin is primarily attributed to lower volumes purchased at the wellhead and in bulk at major trade locations 
in  the partnership s average wellhead volumes declined approximately  barrels per day 
wellhead purchases fell from an average of  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in the decline in wellhead volumes began during the second half of in response to weakening crude oil prices 
volumes declined from  barrels per day during the first half of the year to  barrels per day during the second half of the year 
a large contract with pioneer natural resources expired at the end of  reducing volumes at the beginning of by an additional  barrels per day 
the loss of the pioneer volumes and continued declines associated with low crude oil prices cut wellhead volume during the first half of to an average of  thousand barrels per day 
the partnership increased wellhead volumes during the second half of by competitive marketing efforts 
wellhead purchases increased to  barrels per day during the third quarter and to  thousand barrels per day for the fourth quarter 
the partnership s lease business feeds into its marketing and exchange activities 
the decline in wellhead volumes  as well as significant changes in price relationships for various grades  locations and timing of delivery of crude oil  resulted in lower bulk and exchange volumes in bulk and exchange volumes declined  barrels per day  dropping from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in gathering and marketing gross margins in were positively impacted by a widening spread between the price of crude oil paid at the wellhead and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  as crude oil inventories declined and refinery demand for prompt supply improved 
the partnership also implemented changes in its operations in response to declining wellhead volumes that reduced field operating costs by million 
pipeline gross margin decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  although average daily volumes increased  the average length of the pipeline movement was shorter  resulting in less tariff income 
pipeline operating costs increased due to increased expenditures for corrosion control and the costs associated with the spill the partnership had from its mississippi system in december general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million in over the level 
this increase can be attributed to expenditures related to addressing the year issue in  totaling million that were charged to general and administrative expenses 
this increase in costs for the year issue was partially offset by small decreases in a number of areas 
depreciation and amortization 
in april  the partnership acquired the gathering and marketing assets of falco s d  inc falco 
twelve months of depreciation and amortization on these assets is included in  while only included depreciation and amortization from the date of acquisition 
the increase of million in depreciation and amortization to million for the year ended december   resulted primarily from this asset acquisition 
interest income expense  net 
in  the partnership had net interest income of million 
in  the partnership had net interest expense of million 
this difference of million is attributable to increased borrowings by the partnership in to acquire the falco assets and to acquire a pipeline near west columbia  texas 
as these acquisitions occurred  the partnership had less available funds and increased its borrowings under its loan agreement 
the borrowings were outstanding throughout additionally  market interest rates  as evidenced by the prime rate  rose during by  also increasing the partnership s interest costs 
other income expense 
in  the partnership recognized a gain of million as a result of the sale of excess tractors and trailers 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  gross margin 
gathering and marketing gross margins increased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin can be attributed to the acquisition of the gathering and marketing assets of falco in april and improvements in the relationships between various market prices during  allowing the partnership to apply its risk management techniques to forward purchases and sales opportunities to increase gross margin 
by the end of  price levels for crude oil had declined approximately from prices at the beginning of while the decline in price levels  as previously stated  does not directly impact the partnership s gross margins  the decline generally does reduce the quantities of crude oil available for purchase at the wellhead due to curtailed production and drilling activity 
through the acquisition of the gathering and marketing assets of falco in april  the partnership was able to improve its average wellhead volumes over levels  although volumes in the fourth quarter had declined to an average of  barrels per day 
pipeline gross margin decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the partnership experienced a decline in its daily throughput volumes of  decreasing pipeline revenues by million 
in october  the partnership acquired additional miles of pipeline in the west columbia area of texas 
this addition resulted in a restoration of throughput volumes by the end of to levels at the beginning of the year 
throughput volumes on the existing pipelines declined in as oil producers reduced exploration and production volumes in areas serviced by the partnership s pipelines 
also contributing to the decline in pipeline gross margins were higher operating costs in these higher costs can be attributed to lease payments beginning in the second quarter of on a new segment of pipeline  repairs on the main pass pipeline prior to its shut in  and increased routine maintenance expenditures 
general and administrative expenses 
in  general and administrative expenses increased by million or to million 
this increase can be attributed primarily to three factors 
first  the estimated total charge for the restricted unit plan is being recognized over the three year vesting period beginning in in  that noncash charge was million 
second  in the partnership no longer benefited from the sharing of certain costs with basis under the terms of a corporate services agreement as it did in third  costs increased due to the addition of marketing and administrative personnel by the partnership in april as a result of the falco asset acquisition 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased from million in to million in  primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired from falco 
nonrecurring charge 
in  the partnership recorded a non recurring charge of million as a result of the shut in of its main pass pipeline located offshore 
the charge consisted of million of costs related to the shut in and a million write down of the asset 
interest income expense  net 
net interest income declined million or to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  as a result of the acquisition of the assets of falco and the pipeline near west columbia  texas  in  the partnership had less cash available to temporarily invest 
interest expense increased as the partnership borrowed funds under its loan agreement during the year 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash flow in was due primarily to the reduction in the partnership s gross margin 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the partnership expended million on property additions and received million from the sale of excess trucking equipment 
in  the partnership acquired the gathering and marketing assets of falco  a pipeline near west columbia  texas  and other pipeline property additions 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in and  the partnership paid distributions to the common unitholders and the general partner totaling million 
in  the partnership received million of distribution support from salomon 
the partnership also paid million and million in and  respectively  to acquire common units in the open market for treasury  some of which were subsequently reissued under the restricted unit plan 
cash flows from financing activities were provided by borrowings in the amount of million and million under the loan agreement in and  respectively 
capital expenditures in  the partnership expended million for capital expenditures  with million of that amount for maintenance capital expenditures 
business expansion project expenditures totaled million for various small projects 
in  the partnership expended million for capital expenditures for projects related to the expansion of its business activities and million for maintenance capital expenditures 
the expansion projects included the acquisition of the gathering and marketing assets of falco  located primarily in louisiana and east texas and the acquisition of miles of pipeline in the west columbia area of texas 
this pipeline begins in jackson county  texas  and ends at genesis webster station in harris county 
in  the partnership made a one time expenditure of million for furnishings for new offices 
additionally  the partnership expended million for capital expenditures relating to its existing operations and million for project additions 
the principal project addition related to expenditures that enabled the partnership to transport crude from a new area in texas in its pipeline 
working capital and credit resources pursuant to the master credit support agreement  salomon is providing credit support in the form of a guaranty facility in connection with the purchase  sale or exchange of crude oil in the ordinary course of the partnership s business with third parties 
the aggregate amount of the guaranty facility will be limited to million for the year ending december  to be reduced in each case by the amount of any obligation to a third party to the extent that such party has a prior security interest in the collateral under the master credit support agreement 
the partnership is required to pay a guaranty fee to salomon which will increase over the remaining year  thereby increasing the cost of the credit support provided to the partnership under the guaranty facility 
at december   the aggregate amount of obligations covered by guarantees was million  including million in payable obligations and million in estimated crude oil purchase obligations for january salomon received a security interest in all the partnership s receivables  inventories  general intangibles and cash to secure obligations under the master credit support agreement 
salomon provided a working capital facility to the partnership until august at that time  the working capital facility was replaced with a revolving credit loan agreement loan agreement with bank one  texas  na bank one 
the loan agreement provides for loans or letters of credit in the aggregate not to exceed the greater of million or the borrowing base as defined in the loan agreement 
loans will bear interest at a rate chosen by gcolp which would be one or more of the following a a floating base rate as defined in the loan agreement that is generally the prevailing prime rate less one percent  b a rate based on the federal funds rate plus one and one half percent or c a rate based on libor plus one and one quarter percent 
the loan agreement provides for a revolving period until august   during which time interest will be paid monthly 
all loans outstanding on august   are due at that time 
the loan agreement is collateralized by the accounts receivable and inventory of gcolp  subject to the terms of an intercreditor agreement between bank one and salomon 
there is no compensating balance requirement under the loan agreement 
a commitment fee of on the available portion of the commitment is provided for in the agreement 
material covenants and restrictions include requirements to maintain a ratio of current assets as defined in the loan agreement to current liabilities of at least and to maintain tangible net worth in gcolp  as defined in the loan agreement  of million 
at december   the partnership had million of loans outstanding under the loan agreement 
the partnership had no letters of credit outstanding at december  at december   million was available to be borrowed under the loan agreement 
management of the partnership has entered into discussions with a bank regarding replacement of the bank one loan agreement with a long term facility 
based upon these discussions  management expects that it will be able to replace the loan agreement with a long term facility subject to similar terms 
if the partnership is unable to complete the replacement agreement noted above  then other options will be pursued  some of which may have terms not as favorable to the partnership  including increasing costs and pledging additional collateral 
while management believes that it will be able to replace the loan agreement on a long term basis prior to its maturity  there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
there can be no assurance of the availability or the terms of credit for the partnership 
at this time  salomon does not intend to provide guarantees or other credit support after the credit support period expires in december in addition  if the general partner is removed without its consent  salomon s credit support obligations will terminate 
further  salomon s obligations under the master credit support agreement may be transferred or terminated early subject to certain conditions 
management of the partnership intends to replace the guaranty facility with a letter of credit facility with one or more third party lenders prior to december and has had preliminary discussions with banks about a replacement letter of credit facility 
the general partner may be required to reduce or restrict the partnership s gathering and marketing activities because of limitations on its ability to obtain credit support and financing for its working capital needs 
the general partner expects that the overall cost of a replacement facility may be substantially greater than what the partnership is incurring under its existing master credit support agreement 
any significant decrease in the partnership s financial strength  regardless of the reason for such decrease  may increase the number of transactions requiring letters of credit or other financial support  make it more difficult for the partnership to obtain such letters of credit  and or may increase the cost of obtaining them 
this situation could in turn adversely affect the partnership s ability to maintain or increase the level of its purchasing and marketing activities or otherwise adversely affect the partnership s profitability and available cash 
distributions generally  gcolp will distribute of its available cash within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to the general partner 
available cash consists generally of all of the cash receipts less cash disbursements of gcolp adjusted for net changes to reserves 
a full definition of available cash is set forth in the partnership agreement 
distributions of available cash to the holders of subordinated olp units are subject to the prior rights of holders of common units to receive the minimum quarterly distribution mqd for each quarter during the subordination period which will not end earlier than december  and to receive any arrearages in the distribution of the mqd on the common units for prior quarters during the subordination period 
mqd is per unit 
salomon has committed  subject to certain limitations  to provide total cash distribution support  with respect to quarters ending on or before december   in an amount up to an aggregate of million in exchange for additional partnership interests apis 
salomon s obligation to purchase apis will end no later than december   with the actual termination subject to the levels of distributions that have been made prior to the termination date 
in  the partnership utilized million of the distribution support from salomon 
an additional million of distribution support was utilized in february after the distribution in february  million of distribution support has been utilized  and million remains available through december  or until such amount is fully utilized  whichever comes first 
based on current market conditions  management of the general partner expects to continue using distribution support at levels similar to recent support requirements 
management expects that distribution support will be fully utilized before its expiration at the end of any apis purchased by salomon are not entitled to cash distributions or voting rights 
the apis will be redeemed if and to the extent that available cash for any future quarter exceeds an amount necessary to distribute the mqd on all common units and subordinated olp units and to eliminate any arrearages in the mqd on common units for prior periods 
in and  the partnership paid total distributions of per unit to the common unitholders and the general partner 
this amount represented distributions for the period from october  to september  a distribution of per unit  applicable to the fourth quarter of  was paid on february  to holders of record on january  in  the partnership paid total distributions of per unit  representing distributions for the period from the partnership s inception in december through september  crude oil spill on december   the partnership had a spill of crude oil from its mississippi system 
approximately  barrels of oil spilled from the pipeline near summerland  mississippi and entered a creek nearby 
the oil then flowed into the leaf river 
the partnership responded to this incident immediately  deploying crews to evaluate  clean up and monitor the spilled oil 
at february   the spill had been substantially cleaned up  with ongoing maintenance and reduced clean up activity expected to occur for several more months 
the estimated cost of the spill clean up is expected to be million 
a final determination as to the cause of the spill has not been completed 
the incident was reported to insurers  and incurred costs related to the clean up efforts have been reimbursed or approved for reimbursement by the insurers 
the insurers  however  have reserved the right to claim the return of the insurance proceeds should the final determination of cause be a cause not covered by the insurance policies 
based on its review of the policies and its understanding of the facts associated with the spill  management of the general partner believes that the costs of the spill are covered by insurance and collection of the receivable is probable 
in its financial statements  the partnership charged to expense the deductible of  recorded a liability for the million of estimated clean up costs and recorded a receivable from the insurance company for the insurance proceeds 
should the ultimate determination of the cause of the spill prove not to be covered by insurance  the partnership will be required to write off the receivable of million 
as a result of this crude oil spill  certain federal and state regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties that would not be reimbursed by insurance 
at this time  it is not possible to predict whether the partnership will be fined  the amounts of such fines  or whether such governmental agencies would prevail in imposing such fines 
the segment of the mississippi system where the spill occurred has been temporarily shut down and will not be returned to service until regulators give their approval 
regulatory authorities may require specific testing or changes to the pipeline before allowing the partnership to restart that segment of the system 
at this time  it is unknown whether there will be any required testing or changes and the related cost of that testing or changes 
if the costs of testing or changes are too high  that segment of the system may not be restarted 
if this part of the mississippi system is taken out of service  annual tariff revenues would be reduced by approximately million and the net book value of that portion of the pipeline would be written down to its net realizable value  resulting in a non cash write off of approximately million 
current business conditions despite significant increases in crude oil prices since the first quarter of  us onshore crude oil production volumes have not improved 
further  management of the general partner has not seen significant improvement in the drilling and workover rig counts that would indicate that producers are expending capital to increase production 
the first sign of recovery is normally an increase in the number of workover rigs  the rigs used for jobs that increase production from existing wells 
in  the monthly average number of workover rigs operating in the partnership s primary operating areas was rigs 
that count dropped to in similarly  the average number of rotary rigs being utilized in the partnership s primary operating areas to find or develop oil or natural gas declined from rigs in to rigs in management of the general partner believes that producers that survived the price downturn in and early by borrowing from banks or utilizing cash reserves are using the increased cash flow from higher prices to repay debt and replenish cash 
although there has been some increase in the number of drilling and workover rigs being utilized in the partnership s primary operating areas during the early part of  management of the general partner expects that this increased activity is more likely to have the effect of reducing natural production declines rather than significantly increasing wellhead volumes in its operating areas 
the partnership s improved volumes during were due primarily to obtaining existing production through competitive marketing efforts 
increased competition for existing production generally results in lower margins per barrel 
therefore  the partnership expects production obtained through competitive marketing efforts will result in incrementally lower gross margins per barrel 
as crude oil prices rise  the partnership s utilization of  and cost of credit under  the guaranty facility increases with respect to the same volume of business 
the general partner may be required to reduce or restrict the partnership s gathering and marketing activities due to the million limit of the guaranty facility 
the cost of operating the partnership s trucking fleet also rises as fuel costs rise 
additionally  as prices rise  the partnership may have to increase the amount of its working capital facility in order to have funds available to meet margin calls on the nymex and to fund inventory purchases 
no assurances can be made that the partnership would be able to increase the size of its working capital facility or that changes to the terms of such increased working capital facility would not have a material impact on the results of operations or cash flows of the partnership 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership s primary price risk relates to the effect of crude oil price fluctuations on its inventories and the fluctuations each month in grade and location differentials and their effects on future contractual commitments 
the partnership utilizes new york mercantile exchange nymex commodity based futures contracts  forward contracts  swap agreements and option contracts to hedge its exposure to these market price fluctuations 
management believes the hedging program has been effective in minimizing overall price risk 
at december   the partnership used futures  forward and options contracts exclusively in its hedging program with the latest contract being settled in january information about these contracts is contained in the table set forth below 
sell short buy long contracts contracts crude oil inventory volume  bbls carrying value fair value commodity futures contracts contract volumes  bbls   weighted average price per bbl contract value in thousands   fair value in thousands   commodity forward contracts contract volumes  bbls   weighted average price per bbl contract value in thousands   fair value in thousands   commodity option contracts contract volumes  bbls  weighted average strike price per bbl contract value in thousands fair value in thousands the table above presents notional amounts in barrels  the weighted average contract price  total contract amount in us dollars and total fair value amount in us dollars
