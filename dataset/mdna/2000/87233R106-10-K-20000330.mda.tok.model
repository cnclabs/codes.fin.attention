item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information contained herein  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements contained herein are subject to certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward looking statements 
such factors include  but are not limited to  those discussed below under certain factors that may affect future results and in item of this form k 
overview tcsi currently operates in one segment  which is providing integrated software products and services for the global telecom industry 
the company s two product lines are catalant r  which offers carrier class network management application and platform capabilities  targeting next generation voice  data and wireless networks and worldwin r  which offers integrated oss solutions  including provisioning  service assurance  mediation and billing functionality for emerging service providers worldwide 
the company provides services to customers under time and material and fixed price contracts 
the company recognizes revenues under time and material type contracts as the services are performed 
for fixed price contracts  the company recognizes revenues using the percentage of completion method  which is based on the percentage of contract costs incurred in relation to total estimated contract costs 
the scope and size of the company s system solutions can be large and complex  often requiring delivery over several quarters 
from time to time  customers have established payment milestones  which can be achieved only after completion of the related services 
in limited cases  some customers have disputed fees charged for services provided 
although the company has been  and is  under no obligation to compromise its billed amounts  the company has periodically reduced its accounts receivable when such disputes could not be amicably resolved and may do so in the future 
additionally  a portion of the company s revenues has been  and is expected to continue to be  derived from software licensing fees from a limited number of customers 
the company also licenses software to customers under contracts  which do not require significant production  modification or customization of software 
the company recognizes revenues under these contracts when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been shipped  the fees are fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement 
the licensing and implementation of the company s software products generally involve a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers 
as a result  the company s sales process is subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes typically accompanying such significant capital expenditures 
accordingly  the company is substantially dependent on its customers decisions as to the timing and level of expenditures and resource commitments 
the variability in the timing of such expenditures could cause material fluctuations in the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in this regard  the consistency of the company s and quarterly results have been adversely affected by delays in the purchase of software licenses and related services 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues is derived from the sale of the company s software products and services to major telecom service providers and equipment manufacturers 
due to the complex nature of the advanced element  network  and service management systems being developed  successful deployment of these systems can contain significant technological risks 
the company has in the past relied  and will in the future rely  on its development and implementation expertise 
additionally  development and implementation of these systems often occurs over several quarters 
there exists the risk that a change in a customer s technology or business strategy during such lengthy development and implementation periods may cause early termination of a project or discontinuance of future phases 
in this regard  the company  in limited cases  has experienced  and may continue to experience  fluctuations in revenues and operating results on a quarterly basis due to termination  cancellation  or non renewal of agreements 
management believes that revenue growth is highly dependent upon the development and enhancement of software products that meet market needs 
although management intends to target company funded product development spending at levels consistent with other software companies  from time to time  spending may be greater or less than these amounts  as circumstances dictate 
furthermore  management expects that  from time to time  it may periodically acquire businesses  products  or technologies to enhance the company s current product offerings 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for each of the following years ended december revenues services software licensing fees total revenues costs  expenses  and special items services product development selling  general  and administrative write off of in process technology acquired nonrecurring special items  net loss from operations other income and expense  net loss before income tax provision income tax provision net loss includes charges recorded in the fourth quarter of related to i the write off of prepaid license fees  ii an employee incentive plan  iii reorganization consolidation costs and iv a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  respectively

for the following years ended december  the revenue breakdown is as follows in thousands total revenues services    software licensing fees    totals    total revenues decreased in to million from million in total revenues increased in from million in the decrease in total revenues in compared to was the result of a decline in service revenues and the increase in revenues in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in software licensing fees 
both are discussed in greater detail in the following two paragraphs 
total revenues from services for decreased to million from million 
the decrease in service revenues was primarily the result of the completion of several major projects during and a decline in follow on work from existing customers 
total revenues from services for decreased to million from million in total software licensing revenues for of million approximated licensing revenues of million in total software licensing revenues increased in from million in the increase was primarily due to the completion of several major projects in the united states that were delayed in and the company s focus on transitioning from being a custom software services provider to becoming a software product developer 
the company expects software licensing revenues to continue to vary on a quarterly and annual basis 
for the following years ended december  revenues by geographic location are summarized below in thousands revenues the americas asia pacific europe revenues from the americas decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due to the completion of several major projects and a lack of follow on work 
revenues from the americas increased to million in from million in the increase in was the result of continued relationships with existing customers  particularly lucent technologies  and the result of completing several major projects with tcsi s telecom service providers 
in  revenue from the asia pacific region decreased to million from million in the decrease was due to the completion of several large projects and a lack of follow on business 
in  revenue from the asia pacific region approximated the level due to continued relationships with existing customers resulting in revenues from follow on contracts signed in in  revenue from europe increased to million from million in this increase relates primarily to sales through a new channel partner in europe in in  revenue from europe decreased to million of total revenue from million in the decline was attributed largely to slow channel development 
the company generally realizes services revenues involving design  development  testing  and deployment over a twelve to eighteen month period 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenue in future periods 
to date  a significant portion of revenues has been concentrated among a limited number of customers 
in  and  revenues from the company s five largest customers represented   and of revenues  respectively 
in  and one customer with multiple contracts  nec corporation  represented approximately  and of total revenues  respectively 
in  lucent technologies represented approximately of total revenues  and in  two customers  italtel and idc  each represented approximately of total revenues 
the company anticipates that it will continue to experience significant customer concentration 
there can be no assurance that such customers or any other customers will continue to place orders with the company which will equal or exceed the comparable levels for prior periods 
costs of services the company incurs direct costs for the development and deployment of its customers software solutions 
the major components of direct costs are employee compensation  subcontractor fees  training costs and other billable direct costs  including travel expenses 
direct costs also include an allocation for benefits  facilities  telephone expenses  information systems support and depreciation and amortization of intangibles 
costs of services declined to million in from million in costs of services decreased in from million in as a percentage of service revenues  cost of services were   and for   and  respectively 
the cost of service percentage for increased compared to due to service revenues declining from levels without a corresponding decrease in direct costs and a million write off  in of license fees prepaid to a third party 
the cost of service percentage for remained relatively consistent compared to s percentage the cost of service percentage may remain at or go below levels until existing and future customers ramp up their development efforts 
product development product development expenses include employee compensation  subcontractor fees  training costs and other product development costs for existing and potential new products  in addition to an allocation for benefits  facilities  telephone expenses  information systems support  and depreciation 
the company invested million  or of revenues  in internally funded product development in compared to million  or of revenues  in internally funded product development in in  the company invested million  or of revenues  in internally funded product development 
during  product development spending increased compared to as the company intensified its efforts to secure the earliest possible completion of its next generation software releases 
during  product development spending increased compared to  reflecting the company s focus on becoming a software product supplier 
in december  tcsi acquired gte s network management organization gte nmo which provided the company with an established customer base particularly in the emerging carrier segment and a new product development center in the pacific northwest 
the company expects to continue to invest in its new component based applications 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s product development spending will result in the successful introduction of new products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling expenses include sales and marketing  employee compensation  promotional material  trade shows  travel and facilities expenses 
general and administrative expenses include compensation costs related to executive management  finance and administrative personnel along with the other administrative costs including recruiting  legal and accounting fees  insurance and bad debt expense 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased in from million in the increase in in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to expenses related to settlement of shareholder and derivative lawsuits and costs associated with an employee incentive program 
the decline in was primarily due to cost reduction efforts and an allocation of telephone and information systems support expenses to internal users offset by one time payments in connection with the gte nmo acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were   and in   and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in is primarily attributable to the decline in total revenues for the year compared to total revenues in addition to the costs noted above  related to shareholder lawsuits and the employee incentive program 
write off of in process technology acquired in connection with the acquisition of gte nmo  the company wrote off  in  approximately  of in process technology acquired since the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the value assigned to in process technology was determined by identifying the product development projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been achieved and assessing the date of completion of the product development effort 
the state of completion was determined by estimating the costs and time incurred to date relative to those costs and time to be incurred to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows only from the percentage of product development efforts complete at the date of acquisition  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology 
research and development costs to bring the products from the acquired company to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on the company s future results of operations or cash flows 
nonrecurring special items in  the company recorded charges of approximately million related to reorganizing and consolidating its operations 
such charges included i the write down of certain fixed assets and leasehold improvements  ii costs associated with excess leased space and iii costs resulting from the resignation of the company s president and chief executive officer 
in  the company recorded a nonrecurring gain of  following the settlement of litigation related to the sale of a non telecom business unit 
the gain resulted from a claim  made by atmel  in  under the tcsi atmel corporation purchase agreement 
in  tcsi obtained an equitable settlement of this matter with the escrow agent releasing  of a million escrow fund plus interest to tcsi  and the remaining  less fees to atmel 
in  the company recorded a non recurring loss of million resulting from adjustments to the market value of equipment held for resale related to the termination of a transportation contract in the company concluded the sale of the equipment in income tax provision benefit tcsi recorded an income tax provision benefit of million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the tax provision for relates primarily to the payment of taxes in foreign jurisdictions and the establishment of a valuation allowance against the remaining balance of the company s deferred tax assets 
the tax provision for differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded in that year of million 
the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding the amount and timing of future taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million  and million for the years   and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities for primarily reflected a net loss of million  a decrease of million in deferred income taxes  a decrease of million in accounts payable  and an increase of 
million in receivables 
cash flows from operating activities for primarily reflected a net loss of million  a decrease of million in the receivables balance  a decrease of million in deferred revenue  and an increase of million in accounts payable 
cash flows from operating activities for primarily reflected a net loss of million  an increase of million in income taxes payable  an increase of million in deferred revenue  a decrease of million in accounts payable  and a decrease of million in other assets 
investing activities net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years   and  respectively 
the company purchased million  million  and million of marketable securities in   and  respectively  while million  million  and million of marketable securities matured in each respective year 
the net increase in cash flows from investing activities in also included million of cash used for capital and leasehold improvement expenditures 
in  the company acquired gte nmo  this contributed to decreases in cash flows from investing activities of million 
the net decrease in cash flows from investing activities also included million of cash used for capital expenditures in compared to million of cash used for capital expenditures and leasehold improvements during the capital expenditures during are primarily related to the consolidation of the company s facilities in northern california and to the establishment of the company s office in the united kingdom 
management expects cash used in investing activities will continue to vary on a quarterly and annual basis and from time to time  it may acquire businesses  products  or technologies to enhance the company s current product offerings 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million for the years   and  respectively 
the decreases from to and to were primarily the result of decreases in stock options exercised and stock purchased pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan  which is a function of market conditions and investment decisions made by employees 
additional information on liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash and equivalents and short term marketable securities of million 
the company believes that existing cash balances including cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with existing sources of liquidity  including cash flows from operating activities  will provide adequate cash to fund its operations for at least the next twelve months 
over the past three years  the company has satisfied its liquidity needs principally through its existing cash balances and cash flows from operating activities 
however  fluctuating receivable balances may affect the company s operating cash flows in the future 
the company s receivables are primarily from large  credit worthy customers and  as a result  the company does not anticipate any significant default from a customer s inability to make a payment for products and or services received 
during  working capital decreased to million from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents  which were used to fund operating activities of the company 
during  working capital decreased to million from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to the purchase of gte nmo 
during  working capital increased to million from million in the increase was primarily due to the maturity of approximately million of long term marketable securities that were reinvested in short term instruments and the receipt of approximately million in income tax refunds 
as of december   the company had no outstanding debt 
certain factors that may affect future results and market price of stock statements in this report which are prefaced with words such as expects  anticipates  believes and similar words and other statements of similar sense  are forward looking statements 
these statements are based on the company s current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances which may or may not be within the company s control and as to which there can be no firm assurances given 
these forward looking statements  like any other forward looking statements  involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated 
the following discussion highlights some of the risks the company faces 
potential fluctuations in future operating results the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results on a quarterly or an annual basis as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include the cancellation  modification  or non renewal of service  license  or maintenance agreements  the size and timing of significant customer engagements and license fees  the relative proportion of services and software licensing fees  personnel changes  capital spending patterns of the company s customers  concentration of the company s customers  the lengthy sales cycles of the company s products and services  industry acceptance of the company s products and services  changes in operating expenses  new product introductions and product enhancements by the company or its competitors  the ability of the company to develop  introduce  and market new products and product enhancements on a timely basis  changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  regulatory changes  currency fluctuations  and general economic factors 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
historically  a portion of the company s revenue has been derived from software licensing fees from a limited number of customers 
variability in the timing of such license fees has caused  and may continue to cause  material fluctuations in the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company s products and services generally require significant capital expenditures by customers as well as the commitment of resources to implement  monitor  and test the company s enhancements to such systems 
accordingly  the company is substantially dependent on its customers decisions as to the timing and level of such expenditures and resource commitments 
in addition  the company typically realizes a significant portion of license revenues in the last weeks or even days of a quarter 
as a result  the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations may not become evident until late in  or after the close of  a particular quarter 
the company s expenses are based in part on the company s expectations as to future revenue levels and to a large extent are fixed in the short term 
if revenues do not meet expectations  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition are likely to be materially adversely affected 
in particular  because only a small portion of the company s expenses varies with revenues  results of operations may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenues 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
lengthy sales and implementation cycles the company s products are typically intended for use in applications that may be critical to a customer s business 
the licensing and implementation of the company s software products generally involves a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers 
historically  the company s sales process has been subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that typically accompany significant capital expenditures 
however  the company s latest products are intended to reduce the time and resources required for delivery to customers  and  therefore reduce the sales cycle 
still  the time required to implement the company s products can vary significantly with the needs of its customers and is generally a process that extends for several months 
because of their complexity  larger implementations may take multiple quarters to complete 
from time to time  the company has provided services to implement certain large projects  and  although no contractual basis exists for the customer to do so  certain customers have delayed payment of a portion of service fees and in some cases have disputed the fees charged 
there can be no assurance the company will not experience additional delays or disputes regarding payment in the future  particularly if the company receives orders for large  complex installations 
therefore  the company believes that its quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition are likely to vary significantly in the future 
acceptance of the company s products  product development risks a substantial portion of the company s revenues are derived from the sale of the company s products and services which provide software solutions to major corporations in the worldwide telecom services and equipment industries 
although many telecom companies currently seek to integrate their business operation systems and network operation systems  there can be no assurance that these or other service providers will continue to seek the integration of such systems or that such companies will use the company s products 
due to the complex nature of the oss software developed by the company  the company has in the past relied  and will in the future continue to rely  on its development and implementation expertise 
the company continues to develop software products that reduce the customization necessary to fully integrate customers systems 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will continue to successfully develop and market such products or  even if successful  that the revenue from such products will compensate for any concurrent loss of development and implementation service revenues 
the failure by the company to successfully develop and market such products and technologies would have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company s future business  operating results  and financial condition are significantly dependent upon the continued market acceptance of its portfolio of products and services 
there can be no assurance that the company s technology will continue to achieve market acceptance or that the company will be successful in developing  introducing  or marketing improvements to its products 
moreover  the life cycle of component based products is difficult to estimate due in large part to the recent changes in the telecom market  the effect of future product enhancements  and competition 
a decline in the demand for the company s software as a result of new or existing competing technologies or other factors would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
customer concentration to date  a significant portion of the company s revenues has been concentrated among a limited number of customers 
in  and a large portion of revenues was derived from contracts negotiated with a large equipment manufacturer in asia 
revenue for from that customer decreased by compared to due primarily to the completion of several large projects 
the company anticipates that it will continue to experience significant customer concentration 
there can be no assurance that such customers or any other customers will in the future continue to place orders with the company which equal or exceed the comparable levels for prior periods 
in addition  the company s customers typically designate one individual to procure network management software 
if any of such individuals were terminated  transferred  or replaced  the company would be vulnerable to cancellation of an order if  for example  the company s competitors had existing relationships with the individual s replacement 
as a result of these factors  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
product defects the company provides complex software products for major telecom equipment manufacturers  systems integrators  and service providers 
the development and enhancement of such complex software entails substantial risks of product defects 
the company has in the past identified software defects in certain of its products 
there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in existing or new products or releases after commencement of commercial licensing  which may result in delay or loss of revenues  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  or may otherwise adversely impact the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
implementation risks as is characteristic of companies providing software solutions to the telecom industry  the complexities involved in implementing the company s software solutions entail risks of performance shortfalls 
in some cases  the company has agreed to accept some financial responsibility  in the form of negotiated penalty amounts  if the company s products did not meet specifications or caused customer system downtime 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter delays or other difficulties due to such implementation complexities 
because the company s customer base consists of a relatively limited number of customers  the product defects or implementation errors could be potentially damaging to the company s reputation 
any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
international sales revenues outside of the americas accounted for of the company s total revenues for the year ended december  the company expects that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenues in future periods 
the company intends to penetrate additional international markets and to further expand its existing international operations 
the company s international business involves a number of inherent risks  including greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and  therefore  longer accounts receivable collection periods  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  a longer sales cycle than with domestic customers  potentially unstable political and economic conditions  language barriers  cultural differences in the conduct of business  seasonality  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including a slowdown in the rate of privatization of telecom service providers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  tariffs and other trade barriers 
access to foreign markets is often difficult due to the established relationships between government owned or controlled communications companies and local suppliers of communications products 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to successfully penetrate such foreign markets 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain or increase revenues derived from international licensing and services or that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international business  and consequently  on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
international sales also entail risks associated with currency fluctuations 
the company has attempted to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates associated with international revenues by pricing its products and services in united states dollars whenever possible 
the company  however  generally pays the expenses of its international operations in local currencies and generally does not engage in hedging transactions with respect to such obligations 
upward fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause the company s products to become relatively more expensive to foreign customers  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability 
furthermore  future international activity may result in foreign currency denominated sales  and  in such event  gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in the company s operating results 
in order to reduce the risk of exchange rate losses from foreign currency denominated sales  which historically have not been material  the company has engaged in a limited quantity of hedging transactions 
there can be no assurance that such hedging transactions will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
dependence on telecommunications carriers  government regulation many of the company s principal customers are major telecom carriers 
such companies operate within the telecom industry  which has recently been characterized by intense competition in the development of new technology  equipment  and customer services 
the company believes that large telecom carriers have become increasingly cautious in making significant capital expenditures  due in part to increased competition from smaller  rapidly developing alternative carriers  decreasing prices for telecom services and equipment  and regulatory rate structures that have become less dependent on the level of carriers capital expenditures 
these and other factors have in the past and may in the future cause such customers to experience significant fluctuations in capital expenditures for network management software solutions 
the telecom industry is subject to extensive regulation in the united states and other countries  and the company s customers generally must receive regulatory approvals in conducting their businesses 
although the telecom industry has been characterized by government deregulation  there can be no assurance that deregulatory trends will continue or that reregulation will not occur 
government regulatory policies are likely to continue to have a major impact on the company s ability to attract and retain customers 
for example  regulatory authorities may continue to oversee the pricing of new and existing telecom services  which  in turn impact carriers ability to make significant capital expenditures 
the enactment by federal  state  or foreign governments of new laws or regulations or change in the interpretation of existing regulations could adversely affect the company s customers  and thereby affect the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
competition the company offers products and services in the evolving market for telecom software 
the telecom industry is intensely competitive  subject to extremely rapid technological change and is characterized by evolving industry standards  changing regulatory requirements  frequent product introductions and rapid changes in customer requirements 
these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to tcsi 
the rapid pace of technological change continually creates new opportunities for existing and new competitors 
the catalant product line competes in the equipment manufacturer and service provider markets  offering solutions for next generation telecom applications and platforms  while the worldwin product line competes in the emerging service provider market  by offering integrated oss and billing data mediation solutions 
the company competes with numerous vendors in each product category 
tcsi expects that the overall number of competitors providing next generation network solutions will increase due to the market s attractive growth 
on the other hand  the company expects the number of vendors supplying oss solutions for basic telephone services solutions will decrease  due to maturity of this market and the rapid introduction of more cost effective technologies 
tcsi s competitors include vertel  dorado systems  objective systems integrators  hewlett packard and micromuse for the catalant product line  and eftia oss solutions  objective systems integrators  telcordia  hewlett packard and metasolv for the worldwin product line 
some of the company s competitors compete across both tcsi s product lines  while others do not offer as wide a breadth of solutions 
several of the company s current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing and technical resources than the company 
the principal competitive factors in the markets in which the company presently competes and may compete in the future are quality  price  performance  customer support  corporate reputation  and product features such as scalability  interoperability  functionality  customizability and ease of use 
the company also faces competition in each of the three functional areas that the company believes are necessary for the delivery of network management software solutions development environments  turnkey applications  and custom services 
the company s catalant and worldwin product lines enable the company to provide its customers with development environments and turnkey applications 
because certain of the company s competitors focus only on one functional area  such competitors may be in a position to develop competitive products targeted solely at the segment they serve 
there can be no assurance that the company s current or potential competitors will not develop products comparable or superior to those developed by the company or adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies  evolving industry standards  new product introductions or changing customer requirements 
rapid technological change  need to manage product transitions the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  changing regulatory environments  frequent new product introductions  and rapid changes in customer requirements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate 
this poses substantial risks for the company because the company s products and software solutions typically have lengthy development and sales cycles 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and product features that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the evolving needs of its customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product features that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards  that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction  and marketing of these new products and features  or that its new products or product features will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
if the company is unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce enhancements of existing products or new products in a timely manner  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
the company s products are designed to operate on a variety of hardware and software platforms and with a variety of databases employed by its customers in their networks 
the company must continually modify and enhance its products to keep pace with changes in hardware and software platforms and database technology 
as a result  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements and introductions or modifications by systems vendors and by vendors of relational database software could materially adversely impact the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  the failure of the company s products to operate across the various existing and evolving versions of hardware and software platforms and database environments employed by consumers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the introduction or announcement of products by the company or one or more of its competitors embodying new technologies  or changes in industry standards or customer requirements  could render the company s software products and solutions obsolete or unmarketable 
the introduction of new or enhanced versions of its products requires the company to manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering 
there can be no assurance that the introduction or announcement of new product offerings by the company or one or more of its competitors will not cause customers to defer licensing of existing company products or engaging the company s services 
any deferral of license or service revenues could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
protection of intellectual property the company s success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its proprietary software technology 
the company relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements  and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights 
to date  the company has patents and patents pending related to its telecom products 
the company expects to continue to file patent applications where it believes it is appropriate to protect its proprietary technologies 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will prevent misappropriation of such technology  and such steps may not preclude competitors from developing products with functionality or features similar to the company s products 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
while the company believes that its products and trademarks and their use by customers does not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that the company will not receive future communications from third parties asserting that the company s products or their use by customers infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of such third parties 
the company expects that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the numbers of products and competitors in the company s industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  including meritless claims  could result in costly  time consuming litigation  and diversion of technical and management personnel 
in the event any third party was to make a valid claim and a license was not made available on commercially reasonable terms  or if the company was unable to develop non infringing alternative technology  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  certain of the company s customers regard the solutions provided by the company to be proprietary to such customers and may attempt to prohibit the company from using or otherwise benefiting from certain of the advances made in developing such solutions 
although the company intends to increasingly standardize its integration solutions through the use of component based software products  there can be no assurance that the prohibition or restrictions imposed by certain customers on the use of certain intellectual property will not adversely affect the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company relies on certain software that it licenses from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in the company s products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurance that these third party software licenses will continue to be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or that such licenses will not be terminated 
although the company believes that alternative software is available from other third party suppliers  the loss of or inability to maintain any of these software licenses or the inability of the third parties to enhance their products in a timely and cost effective manner could result in delays or reductions in product shipments by the company until equivalent software could be developed internally or identified  licensed  and integrated  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s future growth and success depends to a significant extent on its ability to attract and retain qualified managerial  sales  and software engineering personnel 
the company has at times experienced and continues to experience difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
the company s future success will also depend on the ability of its current and future management personnel to operate effectively  both independently and as a group 
the company has experienced changes in its executive management 
for example  as a result of the resignation  in december  of the president and chief executive officer  the company is currently recruiting to fill that vacancy 
competition for the hiring of such personnel in the software industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in locating candidates with appropriate qualifications 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
risks associated with acquisitions the company periodically evaluates potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products and technologies 
to support its growth plans  the company may acquire companies that have a significant installed base of products not yet offered by the company  have strategic distribution channels or customer relationships or otherwise present opportunities which management believes enhance the company s competitive position 
such acquisitions could subject the company to numerous risks  including risks associated with the integration into the company of new employees and technology 
moreover  the negotiation and acquisition of such transactions involve the diversion of substantial management resources and the evaluation of such opportunities requires substantial diversion of engineering and technological resources 
in addition  transactions involving the issuance by the company of common stock or other securities could result in immediate and substantial dilution to the company s existing shareholders  large one time write offs  or the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in amortization expenses 
the failure to successfully evaluate  negotiate and effect acquisition transactions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in december  the company acquired gte nmo 
this provided the company with an established customer base  particularly in the emerging carrier segment and a new product development center in the pacific northwest 
volatility of stock price the market price of the shares of the company s common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company s business  operating results and financial condition  announcements of technological innovations  new products or new contracts by the company or its competitors  developments with respect to proprietary rights  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  general market conditions and other factors 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that the company s revenues or operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in some future period 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the stock market from time to time has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of technology company stocks 
these types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
year compliance in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
during  the company completed its year remediation and testing efforts 
as a result of those efforts  the company incurred less than  in total costs related to the year issue and experienced no disruptions in its information systems or products  and believes those systems and products successfully responded to the year date change 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers  vendors and customers throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
as of december   the company s cash and investment portfolio includes only fixed income securities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of the company s investment portfolio  an immediate basis points increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of the company s portfolio 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates in its investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the majority of the company s revenues are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  the company has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
