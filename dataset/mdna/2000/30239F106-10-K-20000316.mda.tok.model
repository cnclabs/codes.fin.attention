item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following sections include a summary of fbl financial group  inc 
s consolidated results of operations  financial condition and where appropriate  factors that management believes may affect future performance 
please read this discussion in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
unless noted otherwise  all references to fbl financial group  inc we or the company include all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries  including its primary life insurance subsidiaries  farm bureau life insurance company farm bureau life and equitrust life insurance company equitrust collectively  the life companies 
overview we sell universal life  variable universal life  traditional life and disability income insurance and traditional and variable annuity products 
these products are principally marketed through a core distribution force consisting of approximately  exclusive farm bureau agents in midwestern and western states 
variable universal life and variable annuity products are also marketed in other states through alliances with unaffiliated farm bureau companies 
we also market variable products through alliances with two life insurance companies and a regional broker dealer not affiliated with farm bureau 
several subsidiaries support various functional areas of the life companies and other affiliates  by providing investment advisory  marketing and distribution  and leasing services 
in addition  we manage four farm bureau affiliated property casualty insurance companies 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  premiums and considerations received for interest sensitive products such as universal life insurance and ordinary annuities are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues 
revenues reported for interest sensitive products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance  administration charges  amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances 
surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses 
the life companies receive investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances  a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited 
amounts for interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
premium revenues reported for traditional life and disability income insurance products are recognized as revenues when due 
future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits 
for variable universal life and variable annuities  premiums received are not reported as revenues 
similar to universal life and ordinary annuities  revenues reported consist of fee income and product charges collected from the policyholders 
expenses related to these products include benefit claims incurred in excess of policyholder account balances 
the costs related to acquiring new business  including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses principally commissions  defined as deferred policy acquisition costs  are capitalized and amortized into expense 
for nonparticipating traditional life and accident and health insurance products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies  in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumptions used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits 
for participating traditional life insurance and interest sensitive products  these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality  and expense margins 
this amortization is adjusted when the life companies revise their estimate of current or future gross profits or margins 
for example  deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity 
death and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year based on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits 
the profitability of the life companies is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality  morbidity  other policyholder benefits  expense levels  interest spreads ie  the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders and persistency 
we have the ability to mitigate adverse experience through adjustments to credited interest rates  policyholder dividends or cost of insurance charges 
revenues and income from continuing operations are primarily derived from our life insurance segment 
revenues and expenses of our other segments  which consist of investment advisory  marketing and distribution  leasing and management operations  are principally recorded in the other income and other expense line items on the consolidated statements of income 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements page for additional information regarding segment information 
results of operations for the three years ended december  net income applicable to common stock totaled million in  million in and million in the increase in net income in is primarily the result of increased equity income and the impact of realized gains and losses on investments 
these items are offset by an increase in operating expenses relating to the closing of an administrative service center and an increase in the level of operations to support our expanding variable alliances 
in addition  net investment income decreased in due partially to a decrease in fee income from mortgage loan prepayments and bond calls 
the decrease in net income in is attributable primarily to the impact of realized gains and losses on investments 
adjusted operating income applicable to common stock  which does not include the impact of realized gains and losses on investments and other items that management believes are not indicative of operating trends  totaled million in  million in and million in the following is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted operating income 
year ended december  dollars in thousands  except per share data net income applicable to common stock    adjustments net realized losses gains on investments    gain on disposal of property casualty operations  net income from fbl ventures adjusted operating income applicable to common stock    earnings per common share assuming dilution adjusted operating earnings per common share assuming dilution the adjustment for realized gains and losses on investments noted in the table above is net of adjustments for that portion of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  unearned revenue reserve  value of insurance in force acquired and income taxes attributable to such gains and losses 
fbl ventures was a wholly owned investment company subsidiary which invested in start up and mezzanine level venture capital investments in various sectors 
fbl ventures was dissolved on june  the change in earnings per common share from year to year is positively impacted by a decrease in the weighted average common shares outstanding during the three year period ended december  weighted average common shares outstanding totaled million in  million in and million in these decreases are the result of acquisitions of common stock by the company during  and a summary of our premiums and product charges is as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands premiums and product charges interest sensitive product charges    traditional life insurance and accident and health premiums    total    interest sensitive product charges increased in to million and in to million 
these increases are due primarily to increased cost of insurance charges resulting from an increase in the volume and age of business in force 
in addition  mortality and expense charges have increased as a result of growth in variable product account balances 
surrender charge income decreased in to million and increased in to million as a result of changes in the amount of interest sensitive product surrenders 
traditional life insurance and accident and health premiums increased in to million and in to million 
during  traditional life premiums increased to million and accident and health premiums increased to million 
during  traditional life premiums increased to million and accident and health premiums increased to million 
management believes the relatively flat sales of traditional life insurance products are the result of a marketing emphasis placed on the sale of variable universal life insurance contracts 
premiums collected on variable universal life insurance products increased to million in and increased to million in the increase in accident and health premiums is primarily the result of the recapture of certain reinsurance ceded business  which is not expected to be a recurring item in net investment income  which excludes investment income on separate account assets relating to variable products  decreased in to million and increased in to million 
the decrease in is attributable to a decrease in the yield partially offset by an increase in average invested assets 
the increase in is attributable to increases in yield and average invested assets 
average invested assets totaled  million in   million in and  million in the annualized yield earned on average invested assets was in compared to in and in the yield during the period declined due principally to a reduction in the amount of prepayment and bond call fee income 
despite a general decline in market interest rates during and  yield on invested assets during increased due principally to an increase in prepayment and bond call fee income 
fee income from mortgage loan prepayments and bond calls totaled million in  million in and million in in addition  we recorded million in interest income during relating to settlement of a fixed maturity security that had been in default 
we had discontinued the accrual of interest on this security during the revenue from these sources is not expected to stay at these levels 
realized gains losses on investments increased in to a loss of million and decreased in to a loss of million 
realized gains losses include writedowns of investments that became other than temporarily impaired totaling million in  million in and million in these writedowns are the result of sustained operating losses  unsuccessful efforts to raise capital and various other operational or economic factors that became evident in the respective years 
net realized gains in resulted primarily from the sale of equity securities 
the level of realized gains losses is subject to fluctuation from year to year depending on the prevailing interest rate and economic environment and the timing of the sale of investments 
other income decreased in to million and increased in to million 
the decrease in is primarily due to a million decrease in rental income resulting from the exchange of the home office properties for common stock on march  the increase in is attributable to an increase in the level of leasing  investment advisory and other financial services provided to affiliates and third parties  partially offset by a million decrease in rental income due to the exchange of home office properties 
see exchange of home office properties 
a summary of our policy benefits is as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands policy benefits interest sensitive products benefits    traditional life insurance and accident and health benefits    increase in traditional life and accident and health future policy benefits    distributions to participating policyholders    total    interest sensitive product benefits increased in to million and decreased in to million 
the components of interest sensitive product benefits  along with selected average contractual interest crediting rates  are as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands interest credited to account balances    death benefits in excess of related account balances    weighted average contractual crediting rates universal life liabilities annuity liabilities we decreased interest crediting rates on many of our products during and in response to the general decline in market interest rates during the impact of the decreases in interest crediting rates was partially offset by increases in the average account balances outstanding 
traditional life insurance and accident and health benefits  including the related changes in reserves  increased in to million and decreased in to million 
death and surrender benefits on traditional products increased in to million and in to million 
accident and health benefits increased in to million and decreased in to million 
during  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the change in reserves on life and accident and health policies 
a million decrease in the change in reserves in compared to is attributable primarily to a million decrease in the change in accident and health reserves resulting from fewer disability income claims 
traditional life insurance and accident and health benefits tend to fluctuate from year to year as a result of changes in mortality and morbidity experience 
distributions to participating policyholders decreased in to million and in to million 
these decreases are primarily attributable to decreases in the average interest rate used in the dividend formula for these policies to at december   from at december  and at december  a summary of our underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses is as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses commission expense  net of deferrals    amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs    other underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses  net of deferrals    total    commission expense increased in to million and in to million 
commission expense increased during the periods due primarily to an increase in direct life insurance premiums collected 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased in to million and in to million 
the increases are partially attributable to increases in the unamortized acquisition cost asset due to growth in the volume of business in force 
during  there was also a shift in product profitability to blocks of business that have a larger acquisition cost remaining to be amortized or that have higher amortization factors 
during  amortization also increased due to an increase in the profitability of the underlying business 
other underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses increased in to million and in to million 
the increases are generally attributable to an increase in the level of operations to support the promotion and administration of variable products sold by our variable alliance partners 
in addition  included in insurance expenses for are restructuring charges totaling million relating to the closing of an administrative service center 
see restructuring 
expenses totaling million in  million in and million in were incurred to modify our computer systems to prepare for the year date conversion 
see impact of year the increases were partially offset by a million decrease in and million decrease in in home office real estate expense due to the exchange of home office properties on march  see exchange of home office properties 
changes in the amounts and timing of estimated guaranty fund assessments resulted in a related credit of million in  while the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement in resulted in an increase in guaranty fund expense of million in interest expense increased in to million and in to million due to an increase in average debt outstanding 
other expenses decreased in to million and increased in to million 
other expenses were relatively consistent during as the level of financial services provided to affiliates and third parties were comparable 
the increase in is due principally to an increase in the level of leasing  management and financial services provided to affiliates and third parties during compared to income taxes decreased in to million and in to million 
the effective tax rate was for  for and for the effective tax rates were lower than the federal statutory rate of due primarily to tax exempt interest and dividend income and a tax benefit in  and a portion of associated with the payment of dividends on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary trust 
dividends on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary trust were million in and and million in the underlying securities were issued on may  the increase in is offset by a corresponding decrease in dividends on serial preferred stock 
equity income  net of related income taxes  increased in to million and decreased in to million 
equity income includes our proportionate share of gains and losses on investments owned by the underlying partnerships and joint ventures 
the level of these gains and losses is subject to fluctuation from year to year depending on the prevailing economic environment and the timing of the sale of investments held by the partnerships and joint ventures 
restructuring we closed an administrative service center during july and merged two life insurance subsidiaries effective july  as a result of the closing of the service center  a leased property was vacated  job positions were eliminated and moving costs were incurred 
during  we charged to expense costs totaling million  million of which remains accrued at december   for related severance benefits  lease costs and other costs primarily associated with closing the service center 
we expect to have pre tax savings from these two transactions of approximately million annually beginning in approximately million in pre tax cost savings were earned during as a result of the restructuring 
discontinued operations and product line we recorded a gain of million in and million in  net of related income taxes  on the sale of utah farm bureau insurance company utah insurance  a former wholly owned property casualty insurance company  to farm bureau mutual insurance company farm bureau mutual  an affiliate 
in addition  during the increase in net unrealized appreciation on securities classified as available for sale was reduced million  net of related income taxes  as a result of the sale 
the gain on the sale may be increased in future years in accordance with an earn out provision included in the related sales agreement 
see liquidity fbl financial group  inc income loss from discontinued operations totaled million for and million for revenues from discontinued operations totaled million through the date of sale in and million in during  it is anticipated that we will discontinue underwriting long term disability income insurance and begin to offer  to our agents  a long term disability income product underwritten by one of our variable alliance partners 
we will not share in the risks  costs or profits of the new product  but will earn a commission on new sales 
it is anticipated that this change  over time  will result in a decrease in accident and health premiums and benefits as our existing block of business matures 
exchange of home office properties on march   we exchanged a subsidiary owning our home office properties for  unregistered shares of class a common stock owned by the iowa farm bureau federation 
we are leasing a portion of the properties back from a wholly owned subsidiary of the iowa farm bureau federation under a year operating lease 
the value of the transaction  which was structured as a tax free exchange of a real estate subsidiary  was million  or per common share 
the book value of the properties was million on the date of the exchange 
a gain on the transaction of approximately million was deferred and is being amortized over the term of the operating lease 
the exchange did not have a significant impact on income from continuing operations in or  nor is it expected to have a significant impact in the future 
the impact is not significant because the increase in net expense associated with leasing the properties versus owning them directly is substantially offset by the amortization of the deferred gain on the transaction 
impact of year many of our computer programs were originally written using two digits rather than four to define a particular year 
as a result  these computer programs had time sensitive software that could have recognized a date using as the year rather than the year this could have caused a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions to operations  including  but not limited to  a temporary inability to process transactions  send premium notices and calculate policy reserves and accruals 
the year could have also caused other non information technology systems  such as telephone switches  to fail or malfunction 
as of march   we have not encountered any significant year date related problems that adversely impact our operations 
the fact that we have not encountered any significant problems is attributable to a three year date conversion project  which began in the plan consisted of the following phases identification of all information technology and non information technology systems that have time sensitive software 
modification or replacement of the software systems 
testing the modified or new software systems 
development of a contingency plan to address any critical system that may malfunction 
in addition  we had ongoing formal communications with all of our significant vendors to keep abreast of the extent to which our interface systems were vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the total incremental cost of the year project those costs which would not have been incurred had the year issue not existed attributable to continuing operations was million and was funded through operating cash flows 
year modification costs incurred and charged to expense totaled million in  million in and million in we also incurred internal costs associated with the year project 
these costs  which are principally payroll related expenses for information systems personnel  have not been separately accounted for and  therefore  are not available 
we expect costs incurred during related to the year project to be negligible 
despite our success to date  we could still experience a disruption to our operations as a result of the year however  we believe the likelihood of experiencing year problems is remote  as our critical systems and programs have been used in our daily operations since december  and  as stated previously  no related problems have been encountered 
financial condition investments our total investment portfolio decreased to  million at december  compared to  million at december  this decrease is primarily the result of a million decrease in unrealized appreciation on fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale  partially offset by positive cash flows from operations 
the decrease in unrealized appreciation on fixed maturity securities is the result of an increase in market interest rates at december  compared to december  over the last several years  the mix of the our life insurance business has been shifting from traditional and interest sensitive products to variable products 
in addition  in an attempt to enhance our persistency rate  we have promoted an exchange program for the rollover of universal life policies to variable universal life policies 
we expect the shift to variable products to continue due to this program and the continued popularity of variable products 
a majority of premiums received on variable products are typically invested in our separate accounts as opposed to the general account investments 
this trend is expected to impact the future growth rate of our investment portfolio and separate account assets 
internal investment professionals manage our investment portfolio 
the investment strategy is designed to achieve superior risk adjusted returns consistent with the investment philosophy of maintaining a largely investment grade portfolio and providing adequate liquidity for obligations to policyholders and other requirements 
we continually review the returns on invested assets and change the mix of invested assets as deemed prudent under the current market environment to help maximize current income 
our investment portfolio is summarized in the table below december  carrying carrying carrying value percent value percent value percent dollars in thousands fixed maturities public    a private placement    private placement    total fixed maturities    equity securities    mortgage loans on real estate    investment real estate acquired for debt  investment    policy loans    other long term investments    short term investments    total investments    as of december   based on carrying value of the fixed maturity securities were investment grade debt securities  defined as being in the highest two national association of insurance commissioners naic designations 
non investment grade debt securities generally provide higher yields and involve greater risks than investment grade debt securities because their issuers typically are more highly leveraged and more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than investment grade issuers 
in addition  the trading market for these securities is usually more limited than for investment grade debt securities 
we regularly review the percentage of our portfolio that is invested in non investment grade debt securities naic designations through 
as of december   the investment in non investment grade debt was of fixed maturity securities 
at that time no single non investment grade holding exceeded of total investments 
the following table sets forth the credit quality  by naic designation and standard poors s p rating equivalents  of fixed maturity securities

comparisons between naic designations and s p ratings are published by the naic 
s p has not rated some of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio 
mortgage and other asset backed securities constitute a significant portion of our portfolio of securities 
these securities were purchased at a time when we believed these types of investments provided superior risk adjusted returns compared to returns of more conventional investments such as corporate bonds and mortgage loans 
these securities are diversified as to collateral types  cash flow characteristics and maturity 
the return of principal on mortgage and other asset backed securities occurs more frequently and is more variable than that of more traditional fixed maturity securities 
the principal prepayment speeds eg  the rate of individuals refinancing their home mortgages can vary based on a number of economic factors that can not be predicted with certainty 
these factors include the prevailing interest rate environment and general status of the economy 
deviations in actual prepayment speeds from that originally expected can cause a change in the yield earned on mortgage and asset backed securities purchased at a premium or discount 
increases in prepayment speeds  which typically occur in a decreasing interest rate environment  generally increases the rate at which discount is accrued and premium is amortized into income 
decreases in prepayment speeds  which typically occur in an increasing interest rate environment  generally slows down the rate these amounts are recorded into income 
the mortgage backed portfolio includes pass through and collateralized mortgage obligation cmo securities 
with a pass through security  we receive a pro rata share of principal payments as payments are made on the underlying mortgage loans 
cmos consist of pools of mortgages divided into sections or tranches which provide sequential retirement of the bonds 
we invest in sequential tranches  which provide cash flow stability in that principal payments do not occur until the previous tranches are paid off 
in addition  to provide call protection and more stable average lives  we invest in cmos such as planned amortization class pac and targeted amortization class tac securities 
cmos of these types provide more predictable cash flows within a range of prepayment speeds by shifting the prepayment risks to support tranches 
we do not purchase certain types of collateralized mortgage obligations that we believe would subject the investment portfolio to greater than average risk 
these include  but are not limited to  interest only  principal only  floater  inverse floater  pac ii  z and support tranches 
the following table sets forth the par value  amortized cost and carrying value of our mortgage and asset backed securities at december   summarized by type of security

commercial mortgage backed securities typically have cash flows that are less sensitive to interest rate changes than residential securities of similar types due principally to prepayment restrictions on many of the underlying commercial mortgage loans 
other asset backed securities are principally mortgage related manufactured housing and home equity loans which historically have also demonstrated relatively less cash flow volatility than residential securities of similar types 
at december   we held million or of invested assets in mortgage loans 
these mortgage loans are diversified as to property type  location and loan size  and are collateralized by the related properties 
at december   mortgages more than days delinquent accounted for less than of the carrying value of the mortgage portfolio 
our mortgage lending policies establish limits on the amount that can be loaned to one borrower and require diversification by geographic location and collateral type 
regions with the largest concentration of our mortgage loan portfolio at december  include pacific  which includes california  and west south central  which includes oklahoma and texas 
mortgage loans on real estate are also diversified by collateral type with office buildings and retail facilities representing the largest holdings at december  other assets deferred policy acquisition costs increased to million at december  due principally to the capitalization of costs incurred with new sales 
in addition  deferred policy acquisition costs increased million during due to the impact of the decrease in unrealized appreciation on fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale 
assets held in separate accounts increased to million at december  due primarily to net transfers to the separate accounts resulting from sales of our variable products 
total assets increased to  million at december  during  the impact of net income on assets was offset by the decrease in unrealized appreciation on fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale and a million repurchase of our class a common stock 
liabilities policy liabilities and accruals increased to  million at december  the relatively modest increase in policy liabilities is partially attributable to our marketing emphasis on the sale of variable products 
as noted under the investments section above  the shift in sales to variable products will have an impact on the future growth rate of our policy liabilities and accruals as well as the separate account liabilities 
during  we issued million in long term debt and used the proceeds to fund the maturity of our million short term note payable 
deferred income taxes decreased from a liability of million at december  to an asset of million at december   due principally to the decrease in unrealized appreciation on fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale 
at december   we had total liabilities of  million  a increase from total liabilities at december  stockholders equity stockholders equity decreased  to million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease is principally attributable to the decrease in unrealized appreciation on securities classified as available for sale and stock repurchases  partially offset by net income during at december   common stockholders equity was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share at december  included in stockholders equity per common share is at december  and at december  attributable to unrealized investment gains losses resulting from marking our fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale to market value

market risks of financial instruments interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure 
substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the profitability of insurance products and market value of investments 
the yield realized on new investments generally increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
the market value of our fixed maturity and mortgage loan portfolios generally increases when interest rates decrease  and decreases when interest rates increase 
a majority of our insurance liabilities are backed by fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans 
the fixed maturity securities have laddered maturities and a weighted average life of years at december  and years at december  accordingly  the earned rate on the portfolio lags behind changes in market yields 
the extent that the portfolio yield lags behind changes in market yields generally depends upon the following factors the average life of the portfolio 
the amount and speed at which market interest rates rise or fall 
the amount by which bond calls  mortgage loan prepayments and paydowns on mortgage and asset backed securities accelerate during periods of declining interest rates 
the amount by which bond calls  mortgage loan prepayments and paydowns on mortgage and asset backed securities decelerate during periods of increasing interest rates 
for a majority of our traditional insurance products  profitability is significantly affected by the spreads between interest yields on investments and rates credited on insurance liabilities 
for variable products  profitability on the portion of the policyholder s account balance invested in our general account  if any  is also affected by the spreads earned 
the variable policyholder assumes essentially all the investment earnings risk for the portion of the account balance invested in the separate accounts 
for a substantial portion of our business in force  we have the ability to adjust interest or dividend crediting rates in reaction to changes in portfolio yield 
we had the ability to adjust rates on of our liabilities at december  and however  the ability to adjust these rates is limited by competitive factors 
surrender rates could increase and new sales could be negatively impacted if the crediting rates are not competitive with the rates on similar products offered by other insurance companies and financial service institutions 
in addition  if market rates were to decrease substantially and stay at a low level for an extended period of time  our spread could be lowered due to interest rate guarantees on many of our interest sensitive products 
at december  and  interest rate guarantees on interest sensitive products ranged from to 
the weighted average guarantee was at december  and we design our products and manage our investment portfolio in a manner to encourage persistency and to help ensure targeted spreads are earned 
in addition to the ability to change interest crediting rates on our products  certain interest sensitive contracts have surrender and withdrawal penalty provisions 
the following is a summary of the surrender and discretionary withdrawal characteristics of our interest sensitive products and supplementary contracts without life contingencies reserve balance at december  dollars in thousands surrender charge rate greater than or equal to   less than  but still subject to surrender charge   not subject to surrender charge   not subject to surrender or discretionary withdrawal   total   a major component of our asset liability management program is structuring the investment portfolio with cash flow characteristics consistent with the cash flow characteristics of our insurance liabilities 
we use computer models to perform simulations of the cash flows generated from existing insurance policies under various interest rate scenarios 
information from these models is used in the determination of interest crediting rates and investment strategies 
effective duration is a common measure for price sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
it measures the approximate percentage change in the market value of a portfolio when interest rates change by basis points 
this measure includes the impact of estimated changes in portfolio cash flows from features such as bond calls and prepayments 
when the estimated durations of assets and liabilities are similar  exposure to interest rate risk is reduced because a change in the value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities 
the effective duration of our fixed maturity portfolio was approximately at december  and at december  the effective duration of the interest sensitive products was approximately at december  and at december  if interest rates were to increase from levels at december  and  our fixed maturity securities and short term investments  net of corresponding changes in the values of deferred policy acquisition costs  value of insurance in force acquired and unearned revenue reserves  would decrease approximately million at december  and million at december  this hypothetical change in value does not take into account any offsetting change in the value of insurance liabilities for investment contracts since we estimate such value to be the cash surrender value of the underlying contracts 
if interest rates were to decrease from levels at december  and  the fair value of our debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary trust would increase million at december  and million at december  the computer models used to estimate the impact of a change in market interest rates use many assumptions and estimates that materially impact the fair value calculations 
key assumptions used by the models include an immediate and parallel shift in the yield curve and an acceleration of bond calls and principal prepayments on mortgage and other asset backed securities 
due to the subjectivity of these assumptions  the actual impact of a change in rates on the fair market values would likely be different from that estimated 
equity price risk is not material to us due to the relatively small equity portfolio held at december  however  we do earn investment management fees on those investments managed by us and mortality and expense fee income based on the value of our separate accounts 
on an annualized basis  the investment management fee rates range from to for and the mortality and expense fee rates range from to for and as a result  revenues from these sources do fluctuate with changes in the market value of the equity  fixed maturity and other securities held by the separate accounts 
liquidity fbl financial group  inc 
our parent company cash inflows from operations consists primarily of dividends from subsidiaries  if declared and paid  fees which it charges the various subsidiaries and affiliates for management of their operations and tax settlements between our parent company and its subsidiaries 
cash outflows are principally for salaries and other expenses related to providing these management services  dividends on outstanding stock and interest on our holding company debt issued to a subsidiary 
in addition  our parent company will on occasion enter into capital transactions such as the acquisition of our common stock 
we received million in cash on march  in connection with the sale of utah insurance 
we received million before applicable taxes subsequent to the sale in accordance with an earn out provision included in the underlying sales agreement 
we may receive additional consideration during each of the three years in the period ending december   in accordance with the earn out provision 
under the earn out arrangement  we and farm bureau mutual share equally in the dollar amount by which the incurred losses on utah insurance s direct business  net of reinsurance ceded  is less than the incurred losses assumed in the valuation model used to derive the initial million acquisition price 
the earn out calculation is performed and settlements subject to a maximum of million per year are made on a calendar year basis 
on may   fbl financial group capital trust the trust  a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary  issued million of preferred securities to the iowa farm bureau federation 
in connection with the trust s issuance of the preferred securities and the related purchase of all of the trust s common securities  the parent company issued to the trust million principal amount of its subordinated deferrable interest notes  due june  the notes 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we purchased from the iowa farm bureau federation  shares of our series a preferred stock at its liquidation value of million 
in addition  we issued  shares of series b preferred stock to the iowa farm bureau federation for million 
the purchase of series a preferred stock and simultaneous issuance of series b preferred stock and preferred securities were noncash transactions 
except for the maturity of the notes on june   the parent company s future cash flow requirements were not changed significantly by the aforementioned transactions 
we acquired class a common shares totaling  in   in and  in as a result of three stock repurchases and the exchange of a subsidiary owning our home office properties 
these transactions reduced stockholders equity million in  million in and million in we paid common and preferred stock dividends totaling million in  million in and million in it is anticipated that dividend requirements for will be per quarter per common share and per quarter per preferred share  or approximately million 
in addition  interest payments on the notes are estimated to be million for fbl financial group  inc expects to rely on available cash resources and on dividends from farm bureau life to make any dividend payments to its stockholders and interest payments on its notes 
the ability of farm bureau life to pay dividends to fbl financial group  inc is limited by law to earned profits statutory unassigned surplus as of the date the dividend is paid  as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities of the state of iowa 
in addition  under the iowa insurance holding company act  farm bureau life may not pay an extraordinary dividend without prior notice to and approval by the iowa insurance commissioner

on september   farm bureau life paid an extraordinary dividend totaling million  consisting of cash and fixed maturity securities  to fbl financial group  inc because of this dividend  we expect that further regulatory approval will be required for any dividends prior to the expiration of the aforementioned month measurement period ending september  however  management believes that  due to the financial strength of farm bureau life  such regulatory approval would be granted to fund fbl financial group s regular quarterly interest and dividend subject to board approval requirements  if needed 
primarily as a result of the million dividend  fbl financial group  inc has cash and investments totaling million at december  except for the potential acquisition of approximately million worth of our common stock to complete a stock repurchase plan and payment of expected recurring dividends  management does not have any immediate plans to deploy this capital and is currently evaluating capital management and investment options 
we may from time to time review potential acquisition opportunities 
it is anticipated that funding for any such acquisition would be provided from available cash resources  debt or equity financing 
as of december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
insurance operations the life companies cash inflows consist primarily of premium income  deposits to policyholder account balances  product charges on variable products  income from investments  sales  maturities and calls of investments and repayments of investment principal

the remaining cash flow is generally used to increase the asset base to provide funds to meet the need for future policy benefit payments and for writing new business 
the life companies liquidity positions continued to be favorable in  with cash inflows at levels sufficient to provide the funds necessary to meet their obligations 
for the life insurance operations  cash outflow requirements for operations are typically met from the year s normal premium and deposit cash inflows 
this has been the case for all reported years as the life companies continuing operations and financing activities relating to interest sensitive products provided funds amounting to million in  million in and million in these funds were primarily used to increase the insurance companies short term and fixed maturity investment portfolios 
in developing their investment strategy  the life companies establish a level of cash and securities which  when combined with expected net cash inflows from operations  maturities of fixed maturity investments and principal payments on mortgage and asset backed securities and mortgage loans  are believed adequate to meet anticipated short term and long term benefit and expense payment obligations

fixed maturity securities with a carrying value of million are on deposit with the fhlb as collateral for the note 
interest is payable at the current market rate on the date of issuance 
proceeds from the note were used to fund the maturity of our million short term debt
