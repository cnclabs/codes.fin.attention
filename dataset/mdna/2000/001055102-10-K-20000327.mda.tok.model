our businesses in japan aflac japan and the united states aflac us service the two markets for our insurance operations 
results of operations several significant non operating items affected our net earnings during the three year period ended december  two corporate income tax rate reductions were enacted in japan 
the statutory tax rate for aflac japan declined from to in and from to in these tax rate declines caused reductions in our deferred income tax liability

another factor affecting net earnings was a policyholder protection system mandated by the japanese government during the first quarter of the pretax charge for our obligation to the new protection fund was million million after tax  or 
per basic and diluted share 
in  toho mutual life insurance company  a japanese insurer  was declared insolvent by japanese government regulators 
this insolvency is expected to deplete most of the policyholder protection fund established in in order to replenish the policyholder protection fund  the japanese government and the life insurance industry agreed to new legislation that will increase the life insurance industry s legal obligation to the fund

exh foreign currency translation due to the relative size of aflac japan  fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported results 
in years when the yen weakens  translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported

japanese economy japan s economy has been weak for several years 
the financial strength of many japanese financial institutions deteriorated during that time  and some experienced bankruptcy 
as we have indicated in the past  the weak economy in japan in recent years has resulted in a difficult marketing environment for aflac japan  continued low yields available for new investments and decreased consumer confidence 
many commentators believe the japanese economy has bottomed out and is on the way to recovery 
the japanese government has developed various economic stimulus packages in the last few years 
the time required for the japanese economy to fully recover remains uncertain 
exh aflac japan sales the percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force 
the increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of in  in and in reflect the high persistency of aflac japan s business and the sales of new policies 
annualized premiums in force were billion yen billion at december   billion yen billion at december   and billion yen billion at december  aflac japan produced strong sales results in  despite the weak japanese economy 
new annualized premiums from sales were million in  up  million in  up  and million in  down 
new annualized premiums from sales in yen were billion yen in  up  billion yen in  up  and billion yen in  down 
although consumer confidence continued to lag because of the economic worries  aflac products remained popular 
our reputation for financial strength  combined with a diverse product line and aggressive sales and marketing  helped guide us through the difficult economy 
we reported an increase in new annualized premium sales  while the life insurance market as a whole declined in new product development is one of several actions we have taken to help mitigate the impact of the weak sales environment in japan 
one of our new products  rider max  was one of our most popular products in this product  which was introduced in  provides accident and medical sickness benefits as a rider to our cancer life policy 
we began test marketing a fixed annuity product in we introduced ordinary life and an economy cancer life policy in the economy plan  which has lower premium rates and benefit levels  was developed to combat the impact of increased premium rates for new issues 
we continue to invest in marketing to improve sales 
the incentive pay system for aflac japan s employed sales managers was revised in to better reward them for improved sales performance 
we increased expenditures during the last three years for expanded sales promotion efforts in japan and will continue to do so in in addition  we will continue our popular television advertising program that was initiated in we have also emphasized our financial strength ratings in japan and are recruiting more individual agencies 
aflac japan s sales mix is changing  although cancer life still accounts for the majority of insurance in force 
cancer life sales accounted for of total new sales in yen in  in and in rider max accounted for of our sales in and in ordinary life accounted for of new sales in  in and in living benefit life accounted for of total new sales in  in and in our objectives for are to increase sales in yen by to compared with and to improve the profit margin 
exh aflac japan investments investment income is affected by available cash flow from operations  investment yields achievable on new investments and foreign currency exchange rates 
investment income in yen increased in  compared with in this is due primarily to the effect of translating aflac japan s dollar denominated investment income into yen 
the stronger yen has the effect of reducing dollar denominated investment income as reported in yen 
also  rates of return on yen denominated debt securities in japan remained low in for instance  the yield on year japanese government bonds  as measured by a composite index  fluctuated from a high of in february to a low of in may and closed the year at 
aflac japan s new money rates for investments in debt securities including dollar denominated were for  for and for the overall rate of return net of investment expenses on aflac japan s average investments and cash at amortized cost has declined 
these returns  which were in  in and in  reflect the cumulative effect of lower investment yields available in japan since the early s 
aflac japan has made investments in reverse dual currency bonds and the private placement market to secure higher yields than japanese government bonds would have provided while still adhering to conservative standards for credit quality 
we believe that we can invest new money in the near term at an adequate spread over policy premium pricing assumptions for new business and assumed interest rates for policy liabilities 
the premium rate increases recently implemented  including one in  have a positive impact on investment margins and therefore should contribute to stability in the pretax operating profit margin 
aflac japan uses short term security lending arrangements to increase investment income with minimal risk 
this program produced investment income for aflac japan of approximately million in each of the years through for further information regarding such arrangements  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance deregulation in japan in december  the governments of the united states and japan reached an agreement on deregulation of the japanese insurance industry 
the agreement called for the gradual liberalization of the industry through the year and included provisions to avoid radical change in the third sector of the insurance industry  which includes our supplemental health insurance products 
aflac and other foreign owned insurers  as well as many small to medium sized japanese insurers  operate primarily in the third sector 
beginning january   additional insurance companies will be allowed to sell the type of third sector products that aflac japan currently offers 
aflac has inherent competitive advantages through its distribution  products  administrative efficiency and financial strength that should enable it to grow even in a more competitive environment 
however  the ultimate impact of deregulation is not known 
exh aflac japan other the increase in the expense ratio in was primarily due to increased expenditures for sales promotion  marketing and advertising 
the benefits ratio has declined primarily due to the mix of business shifting to newer products that have a lower loss ratio than the traditional cancer life insurance and also due to favorable claims experience on cancer life insurance 
pretax operating earnings in yen increased for this increase was largely due to the lower benefit ratio during even with japan s depressed economic conditions  we believe the market for supplemental insurance remains bright 
the need for our products in japan has continued  and we remain optimistic about increasing penetration within existing groups  selling new products  opening new accounts and developing additional supplemental products for the japanese market

aflac us sales the percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force

annualized premiums in force were billion at december   billion at december   and billion at december  new annualized premiums from sales and policy conversions were million in  up  million in  up  and million in  up 
accident disability coverage was the best selling product for the sixth year in a row  accounting for more than of new sales in both and  and of new sales in cancer expense insurance accounted for to of new sales during the three year period ending december  exh aflac us investments investment income increased in compared with in  and in the larger increases in and are the result of investment income received from investing the proceeds received in from the sale of the television business and investing the majority of the annual profit repatriation funds 
profit repatriation in was million  including million of a nonrecurring nature 
during  available cash flow was invested at an average yield of compared with during and during the overall return on average invested assets  net of investment expenses  was for  compared with for and for aflac us other we expect the operating expense ratio  excluding discretionary advertising expenses  to benefit in the future from continued improvements in operating efficiencies 
state of the art technology is one way we can control expense growth  and smartapp  a laptop based  point of sale system  is a good example 
in  smartapp enabled us to process approximately of our business electronically 
about half of these policies required no human intervention 
the electronic imaging of our claims and correspondence is also benefiting our expense ratio 
by improving administrative systems and controlling other costs  we have been able to redirect funds in recent years to national advertising programs without significantly affecting the operating expense ratio 
the aggregate benefit ratio has been relatively stable 
the mix of business has shifted towards accident and hospital indemnity policies  which have lower benefit ratios than other products 
we expect the pretax operating profit margin to remain approximately the same in we continue to believe that there are significant opportunities to market high quality  affordable supplemental insurance products in the us marketplace 
other operations corporate expenses are net of investment income of million in and million in both and corporate operating expenses consist primarily of salary  retirement  litigation and consulting expenses 
corporate expenses excluding investment income were million in  million in and million in the reduction in corporate expenses primarily reflects lower retirement and litigation expenses

the investment portfolios of aflac japan and aflac us have continued to grow and primarily consist of investment grade securities 
the yen dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to translate yen denominated balance sheet items to us dollars for reporting purposes 
the exchange rate at december   was yen to one us dollar  stronger than the december   exchange rate of

market risks of financial instruments our financial instruments are exposed primarily to three types of market risks interest rate  equity price and foreign currency exchange rate 
interest rate risk our primary interest rate exposure results from the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt securities 
we use modified duration analysis  which provides a measure of price percentage volatility  to estimate the amount of sensitivity to interest rate changes in our debt securities 
for example  if the current duration of a debt security is five  then the market value of that security will increase by approximately if market interest rates decrease by basis points 
likewise  the value of the debt security will decrease by approximately if market interest rates increase by basis points

the unrealized gains and losses on debt securities  less amounts applicable to policy liabilities and deferred income taxes  are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the portion of unrealized gains credited to policy liabilities represents gains that would not inure to the benefit of our shareholders if such gains were actually realized

for aflac japan  the duration of policy benefit liabilities is longer than that of the related invested assets due to the unavailability of acceptable long duration yen denominated securities 
at december   the average duration of policy liabilities was approximately years  compared with years in the average duration of the yen denominated debt securities was approximately nine years in and currently  when our debt securities mature  the proceeds are reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years 
however  the investment yield on new investments exceeds interest requirements on policies issued in recent years 
since  premium rates on new business have been increased several times the latest occurred in july to help offset the lower investment yields available 
over the next five years  billion at amortized cost with an average yield of  of aflac japan s yen denominated debt securities are scheduled to mature 
we have outstanding interest rate swaps on billion yen million of variable interest rate yen denominated bank borrowings 
these swaps reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on borrowing costs and effectively change our interest rates from variable to fixed 
therefore  movements in market interest rates should have no material effect on earnings 
at december   we also had yen denominated bank borrowings in the amount of billion yen million with a variable interest rate of

aflac invests primarily within the japanese  us and euroyen debt securities markets 
we use specific criteria to judge the credit quality and liquidity of our investments and use a variety of credit rating services to monitor these criteria 
applying those various credit ratings to a standardized rating system based on the categories of a nationally recognized rating service  the percentages of our debt securities  at amortized cost  as of december were as follows aaa aa a bbb bb at december   we owned debt securities rated below investment grade in the amount of million at amortized cost  or of total debt securities

private placement investments accounted for and of our total debt securities as of december  and  respectively 
aflac japan has made investments in the private placement market to secure higher yields than those available from japanese government bonds 
at the same time  we have adhered to historically conservative standards for credit quality 
we require that all private placement issuers have an initial rating of class or as determined by the securities valuation office of the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
most of aflac s private placement issues are issued under medium term note programs and have standard covenants commensurate with credit rankings  except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and or event risk covenants are required 
during the fourth quarter of  we revised our investment management policy regarding the holding period intent for certain of our private placement debt securities 
our past practice was to hold these securities to their contractual or economic maturity dates 
we have made this our formal policy

these proceeds were temporarily invested in short duration securities and are being used primarily to purchase shares of our common stock 
the net proceeds may also be used to repay indebtedness or for general corporate purposes

aflac incorporated also has an unsecured revolving credit agreement that provides for bank borrowings through november in either us dollars or japanese yen 
at december   billion yen million were outstanding 
we have entered into interest rate swaps that effectively change the interest rates on a portion of these loans from variable to fixed 
we make interest payments to the bank based on variable interest rates  and we pay to  or receive from  the swap counterparty an amount necessary to equal the fixed rate 
we also had a 
short term yen denominated note payable in the amount of million at december   which was due january  this loan was renewed until april  the proceeds from these loans were primarily used to fund our share repurchase program 
when any portion of these loans is denominated in yen  the principal amounts of the loans as stated in dollars will fluctuate due to changes in the yen dollar exchange rate

policyholder guaranty funds under insurance guaranty fund laws in most us states  insurance companies doing business in those states can be assessed for policyholder losses up to prescribed limits that are incurred by insolvent companies with similar lines of business 
such assessments have not been material to us in the past 
we believe that future assessments relating to companies in the us currently involved in insolvency proceedings will not materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
exh the life insurance association of japan  an industry organization  implemented a policyholder protection fund in to provide capital support to insolvent life insurers 
aflac japan pledged investment securities to the life insurance association of japan under this program 
a separate  mandatory policyholder protection system was enacted by the japanese government during the life insurance industry is making contributions to these funds over a year period 
we have recorded a liability for our share of these obligations 
in  toho mutual life insurance company  a japanese insurer  was declared insolvent by japanese government regulators 
most of the mandatory policyholder protection fund that was established in is expected to be used to satisfy the industry s share of the policyholder obligations in this new insolvency 
the japanese government and the life insurance industry agreed to new legislation that will increase the life insurance industry s legal obligation to the fund 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
shareholders equity our insurance operations continue to provide the primary sources of liquidity 
capital needs are also supplemented by borrowed funds 
the principal sources of cash from insurance operations are premiums and investment income 
primary uses of cash in the insurance operations are policy claims  commissions  operating expenses  income taxes and payments to aflac incorporated for management fees and dividends 
both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable 
our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the ownership of high quality investment securities 
aflac insurance policies are generally not interest sensitive and therefore are not subject to unexpected policyholder redemptions due to investment yield changes 
also  the majority of our policies provide indemnity benefits rather than reimbursement for actual medical costs and thus are not subject to the risks of medical cost inflation 
the achievement of continued long term growth will require growth in aflac s statutory capital and surplus 
we may secure additional statutory capital through various sources  such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by aflac incorporated from funds generated through debt or equity offerings 
in april  aflac incorporated received net proceeds of million from an issuance of million of senior notes which increased our capital resources 
we believe outside sources for additional debt and equity capital  if needed  will continue to be available for capital expenditures  business expansion and the funding of our share repurchase program 
aflac incorporated capital resources are largely dependent upon the ability of aflac to pay management fees and dividends 
the georgia insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends  management fees  loans and advances by aflac to aflac incorporated 
the georgia insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of statutory earnings for the previous year or of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end 
in addition  the georgia insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group 
these regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by aflac to aflac incorporated 
a life insurance company s exh statutory capital and surplus is computed according to rules prescribed by the naic  as modified by the insurance department in the insurance company s state of domicile 
statutory accounting rules are different from generally accepted accounting principles and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency 
currently  prescribed or permitted statutory accounting principles sap used by insurers for financial reporting to state insurance regulators may vary among states and among companies 
the naic has recodified sap to promote standardization throughout the industry 
the naic has scheduled these new accounting principles to become effective for the naic uses a risk based capital formula relating to insurance risk  business risk  asset risk and interest rate risk to facilitate identification by insurance regulators of inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurer s operations 
aflac s naic risk based capital ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital and surplus position 
also  there are various ongoing regulatory initiatives by the naic relating to insurance products  investments  revisions to the risk based capital formula and other actuarial and accounting matters 
in addition to restrictions by us insurance regulators  the japanese financial supervisory agency fsa may impose restrictions on transfers of funds from aflac japan 
payments are made from aflac japan to aflac incorporated for management fees and to aflac us for allocated expenses and remittances of earnings 
total funds received from aflac japan were million in  million in and million in these amounts include annual profit transfers from aflac japan of million in  million in and million in the fsa may not allow transfers of funds if the payment would cause aflac japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders
