if sales do not materialize in a quarter as expected  the company s results of operations for that quarter would be adversely affected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
as of december   the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
interest rate risk as part of the company s cash management strategy  at december   spectralink had short term investments of  and long term investments of  consisting mainly of us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities 
spectralink has the intent and the ability to hold these investments to maturity and thus have classified these investments  which are stated at amortized cost as held to maturity 
the company has completed a market risk sensitivity analysis of these investments based on an assumed increase in interest rates 
if market interest rates had increased during the year ended december  spectralink would have experienced an unrealized loss of approximately  on these investments 
this is only an estimate 
any actual loss due to an increase in interest rates could differ from this estimate 
other certain statements in this annual report on form k  as well as statements made by the company in periodic press releases  oral statements made by the company s officials to analysts and stockholders in the course of presentations about the company and conference calls following earnings releases  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the reform act 
caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date of the making of such statements and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
such factors include  among other things  o the failure of the market for on premises wireless telephone systems to grow or to grow as quickly as the company anticipates  o the intensely competitive nature of the wireless communications industry  and a customer preference to buy all telephone communications systems from a single source provider that manufactures and sells pbx or key hybrid systems 
other purchasers may prefer to buy their wireless telephone communications systems from a single source provider of wireless lans such as symbol technologies  who provides wireless application devices  such as bar code scanners  as well as wireless telephones 
because the company focuses on wireless on premises telephone communications  it cannot serve as the sole source for a complete telephone or data communications system  o the ability of the company and its resellers to develop and execute effective marketing and sales strategies  o the company s reliance on sole or limited sources of supply for many components and equipment used in its manufacturing process  o the risk of business interruption arising from the company s dependence on a single manufacturing facility  o the company s ability to manage potential expansion of operations in the us and internationally  o the company s ability to attract and retain personnel  including key technical and management personnel  o the company s ability to respond to rapid technological changes within the on premises wireless telephone industry  o the company s reliance on a limited number of significant customers  o changes in rules and regulations of the fcc  o the company s ability to protect its intellectual property rights  o the assertion of intellectual property infringement claims against the company  o changes in economic and business conditions affecting the company s customers  o a lower than anticipated rate of adoption of the standard in international markets  o the company s reliance on its technology partners to continue to provide the wireless local area network for the company s netlink product  and to provide access points which support spectralink voice priority  o the homologation process for its netlink product for use in countries that support the standard  o other factors over which the company has little or no control and o potential fluctuations in the company s future operating results 
the company has experienced  and may in the future continue to experience  significant quarterly fluctuations in revenue  gross margins and operating results due to numerous factors  some of which are outside the company s control 
these factors include a fluctuating market demand for  and declines in the average selling prices of  the company s products  b the timing of and delay of significant orders from customers and c seasonality in demand 
historically  the company has not operated with a significant order backlog and a substantial portion of the company s revenue in any quarter has been derived from orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
accordingly  the company s revenue expectations are based almost entirely on its internal estimates of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
planned expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and are based in large part on these estimates  and if orders and revenue do not meet expectations  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  due to the timing of orders from customers  the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenue in the last month of a quarter 
as a result  minor fluctuations in the timing of orders and the shipment of products may  in the future  cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
it is possible that due to such fluctuations or other factors  the company s future operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in such an event  or in the event that adverse market conditions prevail or are perceived to prevail either generally or with respect to the company s business  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected
