 reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for reporting and presentation of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements

we do not consider the interest rate risk for these investments to be material 
in addition  we do not have any material outstanding borrowings and  therefore  we do not have a significant risk due to potential fluctuations in interest rates for loans at this time
