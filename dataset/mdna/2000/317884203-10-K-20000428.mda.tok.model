liquidity and capital resources finlay s primary capital requirements are for funding working capital for new departments and for working capital growth of existing departments and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures for opening new departments  renovating existing departments and information technology investments 
for  capital expenditures totaled million and in totaled million 
total capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million  exclusive of the fixed assets acquired in the jb rudolph acquisition 
although capital expenditures are limited by the terms of the revolving credit agreement  to date this limitation has not precluded the company from satisfying its capital expenditure requirements 
finlay s operations substantially preclude customer receivables and in recent years  on average  approximately of finlay s domestic merchandise has been carried on consignment 
accordingly  management believes that relatively modest levels of working capital are required in comparison to many other retailers 
the company s working capital balance was million at january   an increase of million from january  the increase resulted primarily from the impact of s net income exclusive of depreciation and amortization partially offset by capital expenditures and additions to deferred charges 
based on the seasonal nature of finlay s business  working capital requirements and therefore borrowings under the revolving credit agreement can be expected to increase on an interim basis during the first three quarters of any given fiscal year 
see seasonality 
the seasonality of finlay s business causes working capital requirements to reach their highest level in the months of october  november and december in anticipation of the year end holiday season 
accordingly  finlay experiences seasonal cash needs as inventory levels peak 
the revolving credit agreement provides finlay with a line of credit of up to million to finance working capital needs 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to  at finlay s option  i the index rate as defined in the revolving credit agreement plus a margin ranging from zero to or ii adjusted libor plus a margin ranging from to  in each case depending on the financial performance of the company

borrowings under the revolving credit agreement at january  and january  were zero 
the average amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement for and were million adjusted for the impact of the temporary paydown of the revolving credit facility due to certain call requirements associated with the old debentures and the old notes and million  respectively 
the maximum amount outstanding for was million 
finlay does not expect that significant additional working capital will be required with respect to the operation of the former jb rudolph departments because finlay purchased the inventory of those jb rudolph departments which it acquired 
on a going forward basis  finlay expects that inventory purchases for the former jb rudolph departments will be financed in part by trade payables combined with the utilization of consignment inventory 
finlay financed the jb rudolph acquisition with borrowings under its revolving credit agreement 
on january   sonab sold the majority of its assets for approximately million 
as of january   sonab had received million of the sale proceeds 
sonab received an additional million in february upon the completion of the post closing audit  and the balance of million remains paid subject to certain escrow arrangements among the parties 
after the sale  the buyer operated more than locations previously included in sonab s location base in france 
the remaining departments were closed 
the company recorded a pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of of million  or per share on a diluted basis after tax  for the write down of assets for disposition and related closure expenses 
the cash portion of this charge was approximately million 
finlay s long term needs for external financing will depend on its rate of growth  the level of internally generated funds and the ability to continue obtaining substantial amounts of merchandise on advantageous terms  including consignment arrangements with its vendors 
as of january   million of consignment merchandise from approximately vendors was on hand as compared to million at january  for  finlay had an average balance of consignment merchandise of million as compared to an average balance of million in see business store relationships and business purchasing and inventory

finlay jewelry can obtain  pursuant to the gold consignment agreement  up to the lesser of i  fine troy ounces or ii million worth of gold  subject to a formula as prescribed by the gold consignment agreement 
at january   amounts outstanding under the gold consignment agreement totaled  fine troy ounces  valued at approximately million 
the average amount outstanding under the gold consignment agreement was million in many of finlay s computer systems  software products  other systems using embedded chips and third party systems  accepted only two entries in the date field to distinguish the year 
beginning in the year  these date fields needed to accept four digit entries  or properly handle two digit entries  to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  finlay s date critical functions would have been adversely affected unless the computer systems and software products of both finlay and significant third parties were year compliant 
a comprehensive plan was prepared so that all systems critical to the operation of the company would be year compliant 
the plan was structured into five primary phases identification  assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
the company completed all phases and implemented all remediated applications during the third quarter of the company continued to conduct general systems testing as well as testing of specific year scenarios through january in addition  the company formally communicated with its host stores  vendors and other third parties to determine the extent to which the company may have been vulnerable to the failure of their systems and to obtain year compliance certification

during  the company began several information technology initiatives  including the design and development of a new merchandising system and the upgrade of point of sale systems and related hardware in the majority of finlay s departments 
these projects will serve to support future growth of the company as well as provide improved analysis and reporting capabilities and are expected to be completed by mid the cost associated with these projects is estimated to be million for software and implementation costs  to be included in deferred charges and other assets  and approximately million for hardware and related equipment  included as a component of the company s capital expenditures and reflected in fixed assets 
at january   approximately million was expended and included in deferred charges and other assets 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code restricts utilization of net operating loss nol carryforwards after an ownership change exceeding 
as a result of the recapitalization  a change in ownership of the company exceeding occurred within the meaning of section of the code 
similar restrictions apply to other carryforwards 
consequently  there is a material limitation on the company s annual utilization of its nols and other carryforwards which requires a deferral or loss of the utilization of such nols or other carryforwards 
the company had  at october  the company s tax year end  a nol for tax purposes of approximately million which is subject to an annual limit of approximately million per year 
however  for financial reporting purposes  no nol exists as of january  from time to time  finlay enters into futures contracts  such as options or forwards  based upon the anticipated sales of gold product in order to hedge against the risk arising from its payment arrangements 
changes in the market value of futures contracts are accounted for as an addition to or reduction from the inventory cost 
for the year ended january   the gain or loss on open futures contracts was not material 
at january   the company had two open positions in futures contracts for gold totaling  fine troy ounces  valued at million  which expire during the first quarter of there can be no assurance that these hedging techniques will be successful or that hedging transactions will not adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial position

no assurances  however  can be given that finlay jewelry s current level of operating results will continue or improve or that finlay jewelry s income from operations will continue to be sufficient to permit finlay jewelry and the company to meet their debt service and other obligations 
currently  finlay jewelry s principal financing arrangements restrict annual distributions from finlay jewelry to the company to of finlay jewelry s net sales for the preceding fiscal year and also allow distributions to the company to enable it to make interest payments on the senior debentures 
the amounts required to satisfy the aggregate of finlay jewelry s interest expense and required amortization payments totaled million and million for and  respectively 
seasonality finlay s business is highly seasonal  with a significant portion of its sales and income from operations generated during the fourth quarter of each year  which includes the year end holiday season 
the fourth quarter accounted for an average of of finlay s domestic sales and of its domestic income from operations for  and finlay has typically experienced net losses in the first three quarters of its fiscal year 
during these periods  working capital requirements have been funded by borrowings under the revolving credit agreement
