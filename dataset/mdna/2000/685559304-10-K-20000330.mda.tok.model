the company repurchased approximately  shares at an average price of per share 
the company has not made any repurchases since the first quarter of the company s existing capital resources  including its bank credit facilities  and its cash flow from operations are expected to be adequate to cover the company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
inflation has not materially impacted the operations of the company 
certain material trends the company continues to face a very difficult business environment with continuing pressure on the company s prices for its sole source sales and a general reduction in the level of funding for the defense sector 
the company continues to pursue many business opportunities  including programs in which it has long participated but  due to industry wide funding and pricing pressures  the company has encountered delays in the awards of these contracts 
the delay in receiving these awards shifted a portion of shipments anticipated for into the year however  the company continues to experience delays in contract awards and because of this uncertainty  does not see any improvement to revenue levels in the year the company continues to seek new contracts which require incurring up front design  engineering  prototype and preproduction costs 
while the company attempts to negotiate contract awards for reimbursement of product development  there is no assurance that sufficient monies will be set aside by its customers  including the united states government  for such effort 
in addition  even if the united states government agrees to reimburse development costs  there is still a significant risk of cost overrun which may not be reimbursable 
furthermore  once the company has completed the design and preproduction stage  there is no assurance that funding will be provided for future production 
the company is heavily dependent upon military spending  particularly the department of the navy  as a source of revenues and income 
the us navy fleet has been significantly reduced in the past several years thereby impacting the procurement of equipment 
any further reductions in the level of military spending by the united states government and or further reductions to the us fleet could have a negative impact on the company s future revenues and earnings 
in addition  due to major consolidations in the defense industry  it has become more difficult to avoid dependence on certain customers for revenue and income 
behlman s line of commercial products gives the company some diversity and the orbit instrument division is beginning to introduce certain of its products into commercial and foreign markets as well as to other departments of defense

in response to the year issue  the company developed a plan to modify its information technology systems to recognize the year  including the purchase of a new manufacturing software package  and proceeded to convert its critical data processing systems 
the company spent approximately  funded by cash from operations  on its year compliance 
the expenses primarily included the price of new software as well as implementation of the new software package 
the company also spent resources to communicate with its significant suppliers  large customers and financial institutions to ensure that those parties had appropriate plans to remediate year issues where their systems interface with company systems or otherwise impact its operations  and to prepare contingency plans including manual workarounds  increase of inventories and protective cash management proceeds 
as of march  the company has experienced no disruptions in operations as a result of the year issue and does not anticipate additional material expenses related to the year issue

however  the company will continue to monitor the year issue in the event such incidents become evident
