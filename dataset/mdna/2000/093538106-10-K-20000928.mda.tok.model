overview during the past several years  we diversified our operations from being a franchisor of blimpie subs salads outlets into franchising several concepts and operating company owned outlets 
we acquired or developed four new brands  including maui tacos  pasta central  smoothie island and smoothie island juice bar  all of which are quick service restaurant concepts 
we also opened a company owned maui tacos location in atlanta  georgia and one in new york city  invested in another maui tacos location in new york city  and opened three company owned smoothie island juice bar locations in houston  texas 
we started the above initiatives in an effort to expand our opportunities for growth 
the five restaurant concepts that we are franchising do not compete directly with one another 
further  several are intended to co brand with each other  offering the ability to generate greater sales from each franchised outlet in operation 
in fiscal  the incremental revenues generated by these new concepts exceeded million  and we expect these revenues to more than double in fiscal during fiscal and  we invested heavily in these new concepts 
with the opening of several company owned locations in fiscal  we increased our investments in these new concepts through higher s  g a expenses and also incurred losses in the outlets during their start up phase 
losses from company restaurant operations were  in fiscal  compared to only  in fiscal we expect that we will continue to incur losses in our restaurant operations in fiscal  but believe that these losses will be significantly lower in fiscal as the restaurants and the related concepts begin to mature  and pre opening costs decrease due to fewer new company owned store openings 
as we predicted last year  fiscal saw many changes to our operations 
we diversified our business  and now have a family of brands and a number of company owned restaurants 
this diversification has been expensive  and likely will continue to negatively impact earnings in fiscal but  we believe the losses from these new concepts will decrease in fiscal  which will lead to improved profitability for blimpie international  inc no assurance can be given that the losses from the new concepts will decrease in fiscal  or that the company will improve its net income or its earnings per share 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  our income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal our basic and diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was per share in both years 
the improvement in income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was due primarily to lower s  g a expenses  partially offset by losses from company restaurant operations 
due to a higher effective tax rate  income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal these changes and others are discussed further below 
our continuing fees derived from franchises increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase resulted from an increase in the sales in stores open during both fiscal and fiscal  but partially offset by a decrease in the number of locations open 
blimpie subs salads traditional location same store sales increased in fiscal for the year  blimpie subs salads opened locations and closed locations  a net decrease of locations 
there were  blimpie subs salads locations open at june  as compared to  locations open at june  during fiscal  we experienced a shift in demand for our traditional and nontraditional locations 
from fiscal to  nontraditional development outpaced the growth in traditional locations 
nontraditional locations include convenience stores  hospitals  universities  and other locations within another structure 
in fiscal  which included the opening of new traditional locations and nontraditional locations  this trend reversed 
historically  traditional locations have had significantly higher sales volumes than nontraditional locations 
in fiscal  we and several of the convenience store chains who operate nontraditional locations reviewed the growth and performance of their blimpie subs salads operations 
after these reviews  locations with poor performance were closed 
in addition  a greater number of traditional locations closed during the past year than in prior years due to a variety of factors 
certain international stores and domestic stores in areas in which we do not have a strong presence were closed as a result of poor sales 
many older locations were closed as either rents escalated too much  which made operations too costly  or demographics shifted  which lowered sales below acceptable levels 
accordingly  during fiscal  traditional locations and nontraditional locations were closed 
we believe that certain convenience store operators will continue to close weaker locations  while others will continue to expand their blimpie subs salads operations 
similar fluctuations will continue to occur with traditional locations as well 
our current focus is on helping our franchised locations improve their operating performance  which we believe will diminish the number of store closings 
however  we can give no assurances that our efforts in this area will be successful  or that store closings will not increase from the levels experienced in fiscal subfranchisor fees  master license fees and fees from the sales and resales of franchises decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the following table summarizes the components of these fees for fiscal and year ended june  amounts in s change amortization of deferred subfranchise and master license fees   franchise fees   resale fees total   during fiscal  we granted development rights for nine maui tacos subfranchise territories  one international blimpie territory  one international pasta central territory  and one domestic blimpie territory 
during fiscal  we granted development rights for five maui tacos subfranchise territories and two international blimpie territories 
in fiscal  the amortization of these fees was higher than in fiscal due primarily to increased amortization of maui tacos subfranchise fees 
revenues from sales of franchises decreased in fiscal due primarily to a decrease in new outlets opened  from new outlets in fiscal to new outlets in fiscal the lower decrease in revenues as compared to outlets opened is due to a higher average franchise fee for locations opened  as well as revenues recognized for outlets sold more than two years ago  but not opened as of june  resale fees decreased in fiscal due primarily to fewer outlets and subfranchise territories being transferred to new owners 
as of june   we had master licensors operating in countries  and blimpie outlets operating in of these countries 
our focus in will be to continue to sell new international territories while assisting our master licensors with the aggressive development of the existing areas 
although we have strengthened our infrastructure and created an international department to support international expansion  the international market has not developed as rapidly as expected with regard to master license fees and outlet openings 
no assurances can be given that our investment in the international marketplace will increase either franchise grants  master license fees or outlet openings  or if such increases do occur  that they will result in material increases in revenue 
store equipment sales decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease was consistent with the decrease in new outlets opened in the two years 
in addition  we stopped soliciting new business from sales to customers other than our franchisees  and stopped selling the point of sale systems to the franchisees 
in most of fiscal  the point of sale vendor sold systems directly to the franchisees 
license fees and other income for the year ended june  increased to  from  in fiscal this increase was due primarily to greater license fees from the canteen vending service program 
company restaurant sales increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in fiscal  we operated one maui tacos location 
in fiscal  we opened a maui tacos location with two other investors  opened a second company owned maui tacos location  and opened three company owned smoothie island juice bar locations 
we intend to continue to open and operate a limited number of company owned outlets for maui tacos and smoothie island juice bar 
we opened a fourth smoothie island juice bar location in july  and expect to open another two locations in september additionally  we have secured a lease for a co branded blimpie pasta central smoothie island location  and expect to open the outlet soon 
the subfranchisors shares of franchise and continuing fees decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the most significant portion of this expense is the subfranchisor s share of continuing fees  which generally is of the fees we collect 
continuing fees increased  but franchise fees and resale fees both decreased in fiscal  resulting in the decrease in this expense 
store equipment cost of sales decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease was due to the decrease in store equipment sales  combined with an increase in the profit margin on the sales 
the gross margin on store equipment sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to lower sales in two segments with low gross profit margins  including sales to customers other than our franchisees and of point of sale systems 
selling  general and administrative expense declined to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to abnormally high expenses in fiscal  when we incurred higher professional fees related to changing to a different subfranchisor and master license fee revenue recognition method  increased our allowance for doubtful accounts and wrote off certain deferred franchise fees and start up costs 
we continue to try to reduce selling  general and administrative expenses  but no assurances can be made that we will be successful in that regard in fiscal company restaurant operations increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as noted above  we opened several company owned maui tacos and smoothie island juice bar locations in fiscal company restaurant sales increased in fiscal as a result of these openings 
we incurred losses of  from these restaurant operations  due primarily to high pre opening costs and low sales as the new concepts develop a customer base 
we believe the operating performance of the company owned outlets will improve in  but cannot give any assurances that these operations will improve 
we intend to open additional company owned outlets  and will incur additional pre opening costs in fiscal interest income in fiscal decreased by to  from  in fiscal this decrease was the result of the selling of a portion of the us treasury notes we owned in february in order to satisfy the remaining  trademark obligation  as well as lower average notes receivable in fiscal the effective income tax rates income taxes expressed as a percentage of pre tax income were in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal  excluding the impact of the change in accounting principle 
the increase in fiscal was due to an increase in non deductible losses as a percentage of our overall taxable income 
certain losses of our subsidiary  maui tacos international  inc  currently are not deductible for income tax purposes because we cannot consolidate this subsidiary in our income tax returns 
fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  prior to july   we recognized fees relating to subfranchisor and master licensor territory sales when collected or due 
if fees were collectible over an extended period and no reasonable basis existed for estimating collectibility  we recognized those fees as we collected them or when the uncertainty regarding collectibility was resolved 
effective july   we changed our methodology of accounting for fees relating to subfranchisor and master licensor territory sales to recognize such fees as revenue on a straight line basis over a year period 
we estimate that years is approximately the period over which our performance obligation to the subfranchisor and master licensor extends 
we consider the new revenue recognition methodology to result in a better matching of revenues and related expenses we incur in the earnings process related to such revenues 
the effect of the change in fiscal was to increase income before the cumulative effect adjustment by approximately  per share 
the adjustment of  after reduction for income taxes of  to apply retroactively the new method is included in the net loss in fiscal our income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal our basic and diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal such decreases are attributable primarily to decreases in subfranchise  master license and franchise fees and equipment sales  and an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  all of which are discussed below 
our continuing fees derived from franchises increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was due primarily to the increase in the number of open outlets from  at june  to  at june  continuing fees increased at a faster rate than the rate of outlet openings primarily because a large number of low volume outlets closed during the year 
subfranchisor fees  master license fees and fees from the sales and resales of franchises decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the following table summarizes the components of these fees for fiscal and year ended june  amounts in s change subfranchisor fees n a master license fees n a amortization of deferred subfranchise and master license fees  n a franchise fees   resale fees total   deferred subfranchise and master license fees assuming retroactive change in accounting policy   in fiscal  we changed our accounting policy relating to subfranchise and master license fees 
the fiscal amounts presented above are based on the previous policy  and the fiscal amounts are based on the new policy 
if the new policy was in place in fiscal  amortization of deferred subfranchise and master license fees would have been  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  or an increase of in fiscal during fiscal  we granted development rights for five maui tacos subfranchise territories and two international blimpie territories 
in fiscal  we granted development rights for international blimpie territories 
in fiscal  the amortization of these fees was greater than the fees generated by new development grants  so the deferred revenue balance decreased during the year 
revenues from sales of franchises decreased in fiscal due primarily to a decrease in new outlets opened  from new outlets in fiscal to new outlets in fiscal the lower decrease in revenues as compared to outlets opened is due to a higher average franchise fee for locations opened  as well as revenues recognized for outlets sold more than two years ago  but not opened as of june  resale fees increased in fiscal due primarily to more outlets and subfranchise territories being transferred to new owners 
as of june   we had master licensors operating in countries  and blimpie outlets operating in of these countries 
store equipment sales decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease was consistent with the decrease in new outlets opened in the two years 
the decrease in sales to blimpie franchisees was partially offset by an increase in sales to non affiliates 
in fiscal  we expanded bi concept systems in order to sell equipment to franchisees of other chains 
outside sales approximated of equipment sales in fiscal  up from in fiscal license fees and other income for the year ended june  increased to  from  in fiscal this increase was due to greater license fees from the sale of blimpie branded products  as well as royalties from the canteen vending service program 
in october  we opened the first mainland maui tacos location in atlanta  georgia 
the location is owned and operated by a subsidiary of ours  and currently is the only outlet operated by us 
company restaurant sales were  for the portion of fiscal that the outlet was in operation 
the subfranchisors shares of continuing and franchise fees increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the most significant portion of this expense is the subfranchisor s share of continuing fees  which generally is of the fees we collect 
the overall increase in this expense was due primarily to the increase in continuing fees 
another component of this expense is the subfranchisor s share of franchise and resale fees 
this share generally amounts to between and of the franchise fee for new franchises and between and of the resale fees collected 
due to the overall decrease in franchise and resale fees  this portion of the total expense decreased in fiscal from fiscal the final component of this expense is the trademark license fee paid to mbi 
see business trademarks  trade names  service marks and logos  know how and methods of operation 
mbi receives a fee on blimpie subs salads revenues earned in all international markets and certain domestic markets  which consist of all or a portion of states in which we had open franchises as of june  generally  the fee earned by mbi is of the amount received by us  net of direct costs  including amounts paid to subfranchisors and master licensors and the cost of equipment 
the trademark license fees earned by mbi decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to the decrease in blimpie franchise  master license and subfranchise fees collected 
store equipment cost of sales decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease was due to the decrease in store equipment sales  combined with a decline in the profit margin on the sales 
the gross margin on store equipment sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to price increases received from manufacturers which were not fully passed on to customers 
selling  general and administrative expense rose to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was due primarily to additional personnel and related costs associated with the growth in number of blimpie outlets  as well as personnel  legal and other costs incurred in the development of the maui tacos  smoothie island and pasta central brands 
additionally  we incurred higher professional fees related to changing to a different subfranchisor and master license fee revenue recognition method  increased our allowance for doubtful accounts and wrote off certain deferred franchise fees and start up costs during fiscal we believe that the number of blimpie outlets will continue to increase and the new brands will continue to require increased support as franchises and or subfranchise territories are sold 
company restaurant operations were  in fiscal  with no comparable expense in fiscal the first company owned outlet was opened in october through june   restaurant operating expenses exceeded restaurant sales due primarily to high food costs associated with testing alternative product sources and preparation methods 
operating results for the outlet have improved consistently through the year 
interest income in fiscal decreased by to  from  in fiscal this decrease was the result of the selling of a portion of the us treasury notes we owned in february in order to satisfy the remaining obligation from the purchase of the international trademarks and service marks in february see business trademarks  trade names  service marks and logos  know how and methods of operation 
the effective income tax rates income taxes expressed as a percentage of pre tax income were excluding the impact of the change in accounting principle in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to certain losses of our subsidiary  maui tacos international  inc  which are not deductible for tax purposes in fiscal liquidity and capital resources during fiscal years  and we did not incur any material capital commitments 
as of june   our working capital was  and total cash and investments were  we generated cash flows from operating activities of   and  in the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and customer equipment deposits and an increase in income taxes receivable  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
the increase in fiscal was primarily the result of a smaller increase in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and was partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable and lower income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
net cash provided by investing activities was  in fiscal net cash used in investing activities during fiscal and totaled  and  respectively 
the cash provided in fiscal was due to the proceeds from us treasury bills  which were reinvested in money market funds and therefore classified as cash and cash equivalents as of june  this increase was partially offset by higher purchases of property and equipment due to opening several company owned restaurants during the year 
the greater use of cash in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to payments made for international trademark rights  partially offset by lower purchases of investments 
net cash used in financing activities during fiscal  and totaled   and  respectively 
the increase in the use of cash in fiscal was due to higher purchases of treasury stock and the absence of collections on subscriptions receivable in fiscal we repurchased  shares in fiscal  up from  shares in fiscal and  shares in fiscal the decrease in the use of cash from to was due to lower purchases of treasury stock in  and to collections on subscriptions receivable 
in december  we announced a plan to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock 
as of june   we had repurchased  shares under the repurchase program 
we repurchased an additional  shares through september  we continue to believe that our stock is undervalued  and intend to continue to repurchase our common stock under the repurchase program 
we currently may repurchase an additional  shares under the repurchase program  and may initiate additional repurchase programs in the future 
our primary liquidity needs arise from opening company owned outlets  expansion and capital expenditures 
these needs are primarily met by the cash flows from operations and from our cash and investments 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and our cash and investments will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future
