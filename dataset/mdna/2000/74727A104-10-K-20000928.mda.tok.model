item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides additional information regarding our operations for the fiscal years ended june   and  and financial condition for the fiscal years ended june  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included or incorporated by reference elsewhere in this document 
overview quad city was formed in february for the purpose of organizing the bank 
the bank opened in january with million in assets and grew to million as of june  management expects continued opportunities for growth  even though the rate of growth will probably be slower than that experienced to date 
quad city reported earnings of million or basic earnings per share for fiscal as compared to million and per share for fiscal and million and per share for fiscal the improvement in fiscal from fiscal was attributable to increased net interest income and increased volumes of business for the bank  reduced by an increase in noninterest expenses 
the improvement in fiscal from fiscal was attributable to increased net interest income and increased volumes of business for the bank  reduced by a decrease in noninterest income 
the decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to the one time gain in fiscal resulting from the restructuring of bancard s merchant broker agreement 
quad city s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on its loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
quad city s operating results are also affected by sources of noninterest income  including merchant credit card fees  trust fees  deposit service charge fees  fees from the sales of residential real estate loans and other income 
operating expenses of quad city include employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expense and other administrative expenses 
quad city s operating results are also affected by economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
the majority of the bank s loan portfolio is invested in commercial loans 
deposits from commercial customers represent a significant funding source as well 
the bank has added facilities and employees to accommodate both its historical growth and anticipated future growth 
as such  overhead expenses have had a significant impact on earnings 
this trend is likely to continue as the bank s newest davenport location is expected to open in november however  the primary challenge for the bank currently  from a profitability standpoint  is to increase its net interest margin 
large commercial depositors and certificate of deposit customers create a relatively high cost of funds and this fact  along with a very competitive loan rate environment  have resulted in the bank s interest margin being below its national peer group 
management is addressing this issue with alternative funding sources and pricing strategies 
during  the bank began to develop internally a merchant credit card processing operation and in transferred this function to bancard  a separate subsidiary of quad city 
bancard initially had an arrangement to provide processing services exclusively to clients of a single iso 
this iso was sold in  and the purchaser requested a reduction in the term of the contract 
bancard agreed to amend the contract to reduce the term and accept a fixed monthly processing fee of  for merchants existing at the time the agreement was signed and a lower transaction fee for new merchants in exchange for a payment of million  the ability to transact business with other isos and the assumption of the credit risk by the iso 
approximately two thirds of the income from this settlement  or million  was reported in fiscal  with the remainder of  being recognized as an adjustment to the fixed processing fee during fiscal bancard terminated its processing for this iso in may during fiscal  bancard began processing for seven new isos 
however  bancard expects its merchant credit card fee income to remain below previous levels until such time as bancard can develop relationships with additional isos  increase volumes with existing isos or allied can generate processing business revenues comparable to those bancard experienced prior to termination of processing for the initial iso 
bancard s average dollar volume of transactions processed during fiscal was million  and million was attributable to the iso that terminated its relationship 
the average dollar volume of transactions processed during june and july was million 
this reduction in processing fees and cessation of the settlement income at bancard is expected to adversely affect comparisons of consolidated net income in fiscal with fiscal during fiscal  the bank expanded its presence in the mortgage banking market by hiring several experienced loan originators and an experienced underwriter 
the bank originates mortgage loans on personal residences and sells the majority of these loans into the secondary market to avoid the interest rate risk associated with long term fixed rate financing 
the bank realizes revenue from this mortgage banking activity from a combination of loan origination fees and gain on sale of the loans in the secondary market 
during fiscal  the bank originated million of real estate loans and sold million of loans  which resulted in gains of  the increase in interest rates during that time caused a significant reduction in the bank s mortgage origination volume 
in fiscal and  the bank originated million and million of real estate loans and sold million and million of loans  which resulted in gains of million and  respectively 
trust department income continues to be a significant contributor to noninterest income  growing from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal income is generated primarily from fees charged based on assets under management for corporate and personal trusts and for custodial services 
assets under administration have grown from at june  to million at june  growth in the current fiscal year resulted primarily from new trust relationships created during the year 
quad city s initial public offering during the fourth calendar quarter of raised approximately million 
in order to provide additional capital to support the growth of the bank  quad city formed a statutory business trust  which issued million of capital securities to the public for cash on june  results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal overview 
net income for fiscal was million as compared to net income of million for the same period in for an increase of  or 
basic earnings per share for fiscal were as compared to for fiscal the increase in net income was comprised of an increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses of million and an increase in noninterest income of  reduced by an increase in noninterest expenses of million 
the increase in noninterest income occurred despite the fact that fiscal included  of revenue  which was related to a one time gain recognized by bancard 
the recognition of this income ceased as of june  interest income 
interest income increased by million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the rise in interest income was basically attributable to greater average outstanding balances in interest earning assets  principally loans receivable  and higher interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to greater average outstanding balances in interest bearing liabilities and higher interest rates 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is established based on factors such as the local and national economy and the risk associated with the loans in the portfolio 
quad city had an allowance for estimated losses on loans of approximately of total loans at june  as compared to approximately at june  the provision for loan losses increased by  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal for fiscal  commercial and real estate loans combined for total charge offs of  and total recoveries of less than  consumer loan charge offs and recoveries totaled  and  respectively  for fiscal indirect auto loans accounted for a majority of the consumer loan charge offs 
because asset quality is a priority for quad city and its subsidiaries  management has made the decision to downscale indirect auto loan activity based on charge off history 
the ability to grow profitably is  in part  dependent upon the ability to maintain asset quality 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased by  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal noninterest income for fiscal consisted of the amortization of deferred income resulting from the restructuring of a merchant broker agreement  income from the merchant credit card operation  the trust department  depository service fees  gains on the sale of residential real estate mortgage loans  and other miscellaneous fees

during fiscal  merchant credit card fees  net of processing costs  increased by million to million  from million for fiscal the increase was due to increased volumes of credit card transactions processed during fiscal as previously discussed  pursuant to the contract with its largest iso  bancard terminated processing for it in may recently  visa has enacted new capital standards that may restrict the amount of transaction volume that bancard is allowed to process in the future 
this may have resulted in reduced volumes even if the large iso relationship had been retained 
given the volume restrictions imposed by visa  bancard will focus on processing transactions only for the most profitable iso relationships 
for fiscal  trust department fees increased  or  to approximately million from million for fiscal the increase was primarily a reflection of the development of additional trust relationships during the period 
gains on sales of loans  net  were  for fiscal  which reflected a decrease of  or  from million for fiscal the decrease resulted from higher interest rates  which created fewer home refinances and first time home purchases during the fiscal year

one measure of the adequacy of the allowance for estimated losses on loans is the ratio of the allowance to the total loan portfolio 
provisions were made monthly to ensure that an adequate level was maintained 
the allowance for estimated losses on loans as a percentage of total loans was at june  and at june  although management believes that the allowance for estimated losses on loans at june  was at a level adequate to absorb losses on existing loans  there can be no assurance that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts or that quad city will not be required to make additional provisions for loan losses in the future 
asset quality is a priority for quad city and its subsidiaries 
the ability to grow profitably is in part dependent upon the ability to maintain that quality 
nonperforming assets

quad city also generates liquidity from the regular principal payments and prepayments made on its portfolio of loans and mortgage backed securities 
the liquidity of quad city is comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  and cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal net cash used in investing activities  consisting principally of loan funding and the purchase of securities  was million for fiscal and million for fiscal net cash provided by financing activities  consisting primarily of deposit growth and proceeds from short term borrowings  for fiscal was million and for fiscal was million  consisting primarily of deposit growth  proceeds from the issuance of preferred securities of the subsidiary trust  and proceeds from short term borrowings

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of quad city s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of quad city are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on quad city s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
forward looking statements safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
quad city intends such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities reform act of  and is including this statement for purposes of these safe harbor provisions 
forward looking statements  which are based on certain assumptions and describe quad city s future plans  strategies and expectations are generally identifiable by use of the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project or similar expressions 
quad city s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
factors which could have a material adverse affect on quad city s operations and future prospects include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  legislative regulatory changes  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve board  the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in our market area  our implementation of new technologies  quad city s ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems and accounting principles  policies and guidelines 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quad city  like other financial institutions  is subject to direct and indirect market risk 
direct market risk exists from changes in interest rates 
quad city s net income is dependent on its net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net income 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management monitors quad city s interest rate risk 
the asset liability committee meets quarterly to review quad city s interest rate risk position and profitability  and to make or recommend adjustments for consideration by the board of directors 
management also reviews the bank s securities portfolio  formulates investment strategies  and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions to assure attainment of the board s objectives in the most effective manner 
notwithstanding quad city s interest rate risk management activities  the potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net income 
in adjusting quad city s asset liability position  the board and management attempt to manage quad city s interest rate risk while maintaining or enhancing net interest margins 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long term and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the board and management may determine to increase quad city s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to increase its net interest margin 
quad city s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long term and short term interest rates 
one approach used to quantify interest rate risk is the net portfolio value npv analysis 
in essence  this analysis calculates the difference between the present value of liabilities and the present value of expected cash flows from assets and off balance sheet contracts 
the following table sets forth  at june  and june   an analysis of quad city s interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in npv resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve or basis points 
change in estimated increase decrease in npv interest estimated rates npv amount amount percent basis points june  june  june  june  june  june  dollars in thousands quad city does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk 
even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the board of directors  quad city does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting quad city 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of quad city s business activities
