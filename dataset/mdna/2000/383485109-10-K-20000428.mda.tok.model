lamonts is a northwest based regional department store chain currently operating thirty eight department stores  with twenty three located in the state of washington  seven in alaska  five in idaho  two in oregon and one in utah 
lamonts filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code in january  and the purchase is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court

the company expects to repay the short term financing  due december   with proceeds from a newly issued certificate under its receivables securitization program 
the new certificate  which is expected to be issued by the end of the third quarter of fiscal  will be collateralized by credit card receivables in excess of required amounts in the company s current portfolio  and by new receivables expected to be generated in the acquired locations

the company had million of excess availability under the credit facility as of january  receivables securitization program 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company sells all of its accounts receivable arising under its private label credit cards on an ongoing basis under a receivables securitization facility 
the facility provides the company with an additional source of working capital and long term financing that is generally more cost effective than traditional debt financing 
on march   the company issued a million principal amount fixed base class a credit card certificate the series to a single investor through a private placement

subject to certain conditions  the company may expand the securitization program to meet future receivables growth 
uses of liquidity 
capital expenditures in fiscal  totaling million  were primarily related to tenant improvements and fixtures and equipment for the two new department stores opened during the year  and to the renovation and refixturing of certain existing locations and certain of the company s new harris gottschalks locations 
commitments for fiscal currently include the remodeling and enlargement of the company s existing store in san luis obispo  california  and the opening a new  square foot store in grants pass  oregon 
while these projects are expected to be completed by july and august  respectively  there can be no assurance that they will not be delayed due to a variety of conditions precedent or other factors 
the remaining estimated cost of these projects as of january  of approximately million are expected to be funded through existing capital resources 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has other long term obligations with total outstanding balances of million at january  million as of january  
the loans mature at dates ranging from to  bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to  and are collateralized by various properties and equipment of the company 
the scheduled annual principal maturities on the company s various long term obligations are million  million  million  million and  for fiscal through  with million due thereafter 
in addition  in fiscal the company issued a million subordinated note in connection with the harris acquisition 
the subordinated note is due august   but may be extended to august under certain circumstances 
on february   the board of directors of the company approved the repurchase of up to million of company common stock  in open market or private transactions  for a period of up to twelve months 
any shares that may be repurchased will be held as treasury shares initially and may be used in connection with the company s stock option program and for other general corporate purposes or acquisitions 
the company expects to finance the repurchases from working capital 
no shares have been repurchased as of the date of this report 
the company s revolving line of credit agreement  and certain of its long term debt and lease arrangements contain various restrictive covenants 
the company was in compliance with all such restrictive covenants as of january  management believes the previously described sources of liquidity are adequate to meet the company s working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for fiscal management also believes it has sufficient sources of liquidity for its long term growth plans at moderate levels 
the company may engage in other financing activities if they are necessary or deemed to be advantageous 
inflation although inflation has not been a material factor in the company s operations during the past several years  the company has experienced increases in the costs of certain of its merchandise  salaries  employee benefits and other general and administrative costs 
the company is generally able to offset these increases by adjusting its selling prices or by modifying its operations 
the company s ability to adjust selling prices is limited by competitive pressures in its market areas 
the company accounts for its merchandise inventories on the retail method using last in  first out lifo cost based upon the department store price indices published by the bureau of labor statistics 
under this method  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current costs and thus reduces the impact of inflation on reported income due to increasing costs 
seasonality the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with the major portion of net sales  gross profit and operating results realized during the christmas selling months of november and december of each year  and to a lesser extent  during the easter and back to school selling seasons 
the company s results may also vary from quarter to quarter as a result of  among other things  the timing and level of the company s sales promotions  weather  fashion trends and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and in the company s market areas 
working capital requirements also fluctuate during the year  increasing substantially prior to the christmas selling season when the company must carry significantly higher inventory levels 
the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly results of operations for fiscal and in thousands  except per share data 
see note to the consolidated financial statements

net income in the three month period ended january  includes a non recurring  pre tax charge of  to reflect the impairment of an investment accounted for under the cost method 
the increase in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during fiscal resulted from the issuance of  shares of common stock to harris on august  in connection with a business acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards the securities and exchange commission recently issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which is effective for fiscal and requires that leased department sales no longer be combined with net sales for financial reporting purposes  and that all prior periods presented be reclassified to conform with the required presentation 
the company  like most retailers  previously combined sales from leased departments with owned sales  with the related costs combined with cost of sales 
the adoption of sab no 
has no impact on the company s prior or future operating results and relates only to financial statement presentation and disclosure 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as deferred by sfas no 
 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company currently does not have any derivatives and therefore does not expect that the adoption of this standard  effective beginning fiscal  will have a material impact on the company s financial position or the results of its operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the normal course of business due to changes in interest rates on short term borrowings under its revolving line of credit 
as of january   line of credit borrowings subject to a variable interest rate represented of the company s total outstanding borrowings both on and off balance sheet 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for speculative or trading purposes  nor does the company purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
the interest payable on the company s revolving line of credit is based on a variable interest rate and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
an increase of basis points on existing line of credit borrowings a change from the company s weighted average interest rate as of january  would reduce the company s pre tax net income and cash flow by approximately  this basis point increase in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of the company s fixed rate financial instruments
