they represent the second largest earning asset component after loans 
the corporation holds various types of securities  including mortgage backed securities 
inherent in mortgage backed securities is prepayment risk  which occurs when borrowers prepay their obligations due to market fluctuations and rates 
in an effort to reduce this risk  management monitors the amount of mortgage backed securities contained in the portfolio

the lending policies address risks associated with each type of lending  collateralization  loan to value ratios  loan concentrations  insider lending  and other pertinent matters 
these functions are monitored by subsidiary and corporate loan review personnel and by the loan committees of the subsidiaries boards of directors for compliance and loan quality 
management believes that careful loan administration and high credit standards minimize credit risk 
speculative loans are prohibited and the loan portfolio contains no foreign loans 
the corporation s loan portfolio is diversified by type of loan and industry  and  within its market area  by geographic location  which minimizes economic risk 
the loan portfolio contained commercial loans  loans secured by real estate  and consumer loans at december  the corporation s subsidiary banks lend to customers in various industries including manufacturing  agricultural  health and other services  transportation  mining  wholesale  and retail 
during total net loans increased  or  with commercial and industrial loans decreasing  or  loans secured by real estate increasing  or  and consumer loans decreasing  or 
moderate loan demand drove the increase in total loans 
the change in categories resulted from the corporation re coding loan types to reflect their proper security classification 
the corporation s guidelines for residential mortgage lending were followed and advances normally did not exceed of appraised value

defaulted municipal securities are those which have defaulted on interest payments 
nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest recognition has been suspended because of doubts as to the borrower s ability to repay principal or interest 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status after becoming days past due if the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question 
loans which are current  but as to which serious doubt exists about repayment ability  may also be placed on nonaccrual status 
restructured loans are loans where the terms have been changed to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest because of the borrower s financial position 
past due loans are loans that are continuing to accrue interest but are contractually past due ninety days or more as to interest or principal payments 
other real estate owned represents properties obtained for debts previously contracted 
management is not aware of any loans which have not been disclosed as non performing assets that represent or result from unfavorable trends or uncertainties which management reasonably believes will materially adversely affect future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or represent material credits as to which management has serious doubt as to the ability of such borrower to comply with loan repayment terms

on a quarterly basis  each subsidiary bank performs an evaluation of the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses 
the evaluation includes an analysis of past due loans  loans criticized during regulatory examinations  internally classified loans  delinquency trends  and other relevant factors 
the results of these evaluations are used by the corporation to determine the adequacy of the consolidated allowance for loan losses 
credit management the allowance for loan losses is that amount which  in management s opinion  is adequate to absorb estimated loan losses as determined by management s periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio 
the evaluation by management is based upon consideration of various factors including growth of the portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  prior and current loss experience  the results of recent regulatory examinations and economic conditions 
loans that are deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance  while recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned as well as any other pertinent factors 
the allowance is based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios 
the corporation s methodology for assessing the appropriate reserve level consists of several key elements 
larger commercial loans that exhibit potential or observed weaknesses are subject to individual review 
where appropriate  an allocation is made to the allowance for individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrowers ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the corporation 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in statement of financial accounting standards no 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable the corporation will not be able to collect all amounts due 
the allowance established for impaired loans is determined based on the fair value of the investment measured using either the present value of expected cash flows based on the initial effective interest rate on the loan or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
historical loss ratios are applied to other commercial loans not subject to specific allowance allocations 
homogeneous loans  such as consumer installment and residential real estate loans  are not individually risk graded 
an allowance is established for each pool of loans based upon historical loss ratios 
loss rates are based on the average net charge off history by loan category 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is determined based on management s assessment of economic conditions and specific economic factors in the individual markets in which the corporation operates 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss when evaluating the allowance for pools of loans 
the provision for loan losses is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that is adequate to absorb estimated loan losses as determined by management s periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio 
this evaluation by management is based upon consideration of actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the provision for loan losses totaled million in  an increase of million over the million provided in during the fourth quarter of  management centralized the process for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
as part of this process  and also in response to unfavorable trends in delinquencies and non performing assets  the corporation performed an extensive credit risk assessment of the corporation s loan portfolio 
the results of this assessment revealed the need to increase the allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  the corporation recorded a provision for loan losses of million in the fourth quarter

the dividend payout ratio for was  compared to in as of december   there were no material commitments for capital expenditures 
guidelines for minimum capital levels have been established for the corporation by the frb 
tier core capital consists of shareholders equity less goodwill  other identifiable intangible assets  and unrealized losses on marketable equity securities 
total capital consists of tier capital plus allowance for loan losses 
minimum capital levels are for the leverage ratio which is defined as tier capital as a percentage of total assets less goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets  for tier capital to risk weighted assets  and for total capital to risk weighted assets 
the corporation has exceeded each of these levels 
its leverage ratio was and  tier capital to risk weighted assets was and  and total capital to risk weighted assets was and at the end of and  respectively 
in addition  each subsidiary bank exceeded minimum regulatory capital guidelines during and short term borrowings federal funds purchased are borrowings from other financial institutions that mature daily 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase are secured transactions with customers 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within six months 
notes payable us treasury are demand notes created by treasury tax and loan account funds transfers 
short term borrowings increased  or  during at december   the corporation had federal funds purchased of  and had no federal funds purchased at december  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and notes payable us treasury decreased during by  or  and increased by  or  in the decrease in consolidated short term borrowing during was due to increased use of federal home loan bank advance lines  the purchase of a branch office  and the issuance of trust preferred securities 
short term borrowings at december  federal funds purchased   securities sold under agreements to repurchase    notes payable us treasury  total    securities sold under notes federal agreements payable funds to us purchased repurchase treasury average amount outstanding   maximum amount at any month end   weighted average interest rate during the year end of year average amount outstanding    maximum amount at any month end    weighted average interest rate during the year end of year average amount outstanding    maximum amount at any month end    weighted average interest rate during the year end of year liquidity liquidity of a banking institution reflects the ability to provide funds to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits  and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities 
funding loan requests  providing for liability outflows  and managing interest rate fluctuations require continuous analysis in order to match maturities of specific categories of short term and long term loans and investments with specific types of deposits and borrowings 
bank liquidity is thus normally considered in terms of the nature of mix of the banking institution s sources and uses of funds 
for the corporation  the primary sources of short term liquidity have been federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits in banks  and us government and agency securities available for sale 
in addition to these sources  short term liquidity is provided by maturing loans and securities 
the balance between these sources and needs to fund loan demand and deposit withdrawals is monitored under the corporation s asset liability management program and by each subsidiary bank providing liquidity without penalizing earnings 
when these sources are not adequate  the corporation may use federal funds purchased  brokered deposits  and its lines with federal home loan banks as alternative sources of liquidity 
additionally  the corporation s underwriting standards for its mortgage loan portfolio comply with standards established by government housing agencies  as a result  a portion of the mortgage loan portfolio could be sold to provide additional liquidity 
at december  and  respectively  federal funds sold were and  interest bearing deposits in banks were and  and us government and agency securities available for sale were  and  these sources and other liquid assets also satisfy long term liquidity needs 
long term liquidity is managed in the same way  only with longer maturities  to provide for future needs while maintaining interest margins 
in  the corporation increased its use of its federal home loan bank lines to reduce its dependence on short term federal funds borrowings 
at december   the corporation had  in unused federal funds and federal home loan bank lines 
the corporation s trust securities affiliate issued  in trust preferred securities in  primarily  to fund the purchase of a subsidiary bank and a branch 
the corporation has guaranteed debt of non banking subsidiaries totaling  to northern trust company and norlease  inc at december   the corporation was in default of a financial covenant to northern trust company and norlease  inc requiring that the corporation maintain  on a consolidated basis  a ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans of not less than 
the corporation received a waiver  dated march   of this covenant until june  the corporation intends to seek additional waivers of the covenant and or use additional sources of cash and or debt financing to refinance the debt if additional waivers cannot be obtained 
the ability of the corporation to pay cash dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks 
banking regulations impose restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends to the corporation 
the amount of dividends that could be paid is further restricted by management to maintain prudent capital levels 
interest rate sensitivity the corporation s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the corporation 
other types of market risk do not arise in the normal course of the corporation s business activities 
interest rate risk is the potential economic loss due to future interest rate changes 
this economic loss can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the corporation s net income is dependent  to a significant degree  on its net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than interest earning assets  an increase in market rates could adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  if interest earning assets reprice or mature more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  a decrease in market rates could adversely affect net interest income 
changes in market rates can cause fluctuations in the current fair market values of financial instruments 
in order to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  the corporation monitors interest rate risk through analysis of standard gap reports and interest rate shock simulation reports on the effect of changes in interest rates on net interest income and on the economic value of equity the present value of expected cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities 
the following tables set forth  at december   an analysis of the corporation s interest rate risk as measured by the estimated change in economic value of equity eve and net interest income nii following parallel shifts in the yield curve 
interest rate sensitivity continued certain assumptions were employed in preparing data in the following tables 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates  and the market values of certain assets under the various interest rate scenarios 
estimated increase estimated increase decrease in eve decrease in nii changes in estimated estimated interest rates eve amount amount percent nii amount amount percent basis points even if interest rates change in the designated amounts  there can be no assurance that the corporation s assets and liabilities would perform as set forth 
in addition  a change in us treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the treasury yield curve would cause significantly different changes to the eve or nii than indicated above 
derivative financial instruments include futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  option contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
the corporation currently does not enter into futures  forwards  swaps  or options 
in the normal course of business  however  the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the contractual or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the corporation has in particular classes of financial instruments 
financial instruments with off balance sheet risk at december  are discussed more thoroughly in note of the consolidated financial statements

changes in net interest income for the last two years are presented in the following schedule with dollar changes allocated to rate and volume variances 
the combined rate volume variances are included in the total volume variances 
in addition to this schedule  at the end of management s discussion is a three year balance sheet analysis on an average basis and an analysis of net interest income

average loans increased  or  during compared to an increase of  or  during approximately of the growth in average loans in was attributable to acquisitions accounted for as purchases 
loan income increased in and in  principally due to increased loan volumes 
the average yield on loans was in and in average securities before market value adjustments decreased by  in and decreased by  in securities income decreased  or  in and decreased  or  in the yield on securities increased from in to in during  volumes decreased on securities 
this decrease was the result of the use of proceeds from securities maturities and sales to fund loan growth

in and  net interest income increased  and  respectively 
increases in volumes accounted for substantially all of the increase in and the change in the mix of earning assets and a lower cost of funds in was principally responsible for the increase in net interest income in the principal reason for the increase in net interest income in was the acquisitions made under the purchase method of accounting during that calendar year 
noninterest income noninterest income  excluding gains or losses on securities transactions  totaled million in and million in service charges  fees and other income decreased almost from million in to million in gains on sale of mortgage loans decreased approximately thousand or compared to due to a decrease in the volume of loans originated for sale in the secondary market

an additional  loss on sale was recognized in the fourth quarter and the remainder of the portfolio was written down approximately  due to its decline in value and management s intent to sell the portfolio

in addition  in the corporation realized a gain of  on the termination of its defined benefit pension plan  which reduced employment expenses 
excluding the additional employment expenses in and the pension settlement gain in  salaries and employee benefit costs decreased approximately

it is anticipated that the corporation  as part of the new strategic plan  will incur additional costs of approximately million during the year relating to costs associated with the name change to integra and the combination of the twelve banking subsidiaries 
in addition  during the first quarter of  the corporation  as part of a new strategic plan  anticipates closing the sale of the servicing rights on certain non portfolio mortgages 
the estimated gain on the servicing rights sales will be approximately million 
year during  management completed the process of preparing for the year date change 
this process involved identifying and remediating date recognition problems in computer system  software  and other operating equipment  working with third parties to address their year issues  and developing contingency plans to address potential risks in the event of year failure 
to date  the corporation has successfully managed the transition 
although considered unlikely  unanticipated problems in the corporation s core business processes  including problems associated with non compliant third parties and disruptions to the economy in general  could still occur despite efforts to date to remediate affected systems and develop contingency plans 
management will continue to monitor all business processes  including interaction with the corporation s customers  vendors  and other third parties  throughout to address any issues and ensure all processes continue to function properly 
management expected total additional out of pocket expenditures incurred in year compliance to be approximately this included fees to outside consulting firms  costs to upgrade equipment specifically for the purpose of year compliance  and certain administrative expenditures
