item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview the company began operations in september and initially focused on the acquisition of producing properties 
as a result of the increasing availability of economic onshore d seismic surveys  the company began to obtain d seismic data and options to lease substantial acreage in and began to drill its d based prospects in the company drilled  and wells in  and respectively 
the company has budgeted to drill gross wells net in  however  in order to drill the expected number of wells the company will need to obtain additional financing and the actual number of wells drilled will vary depending upon the company s ability to obtain this financing  success of drilling program  weather delays and other factors 
if the company drills the number of wells it has budgeted for  depreciation  depletion and amortization are expected to increase and oil and gas operating expenses are expected to increase over levels incurred in the company has typically retained the majority of its interests in shallow  normally pressured prospects and sold a portion of its interests in deeper  over pressured prospects 
the financial statements set forth herein are prepared on the basis of a combination of carrizo and the entities that were a party to the combination transactions 
carrizo and the entities combined with it in the combination transactions were not required to pay federal income taxes due to their status as partnerships or subchapter s corporations  which are not subject to federal income taxation 
instead  taxes for such periods were paid by the shareholders and partners of such entities 
on may   carrizo terminated its status as an s corporation and thereafter became subject to federal income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company established a deferred tax liability in the second quarter of  resulting in a noncash charge to income of approximately million 
the company has primarily grown through the internal development of properties within its exploration project areas  although the company acquired properties with existing production in the camp hill project in late  the encinitas project in early and the la rosa project in the company made these acquisitions through the use of limited partnerships with carrizo or carrizo production  inc as the general partner 
in addition  in november the company acquired assets in wharton county  texas in the jones branch project area for approximately  prior to the offering  carrizo conducted its oil and natural gas operations directly  with industry partners and through the following affiliated entities carrizo production  inc  encinitas partners ltd  la rosa partners ltd  carrizo partners ltd 
and placedo partners ltd 
concurrently with the closing of the offering  combination transactions were closed 
the combination transactions consisted of the following i carrizo production  inc merged into carrizo  ii carrizo acquired encinitas partners ltd 
in two steps a carrizo acquired the limited partner interests in encinitas partners ltd 
held by certain of the company s directors and b encinitas partners ltd 
merged into carrizo  iii la rosa partners ltd 
merged into carrizo  and iv carrizo partners ltd 
merged into carrizo 
as a result of the merger of carrizo and carrizo partners ltd  carrizo became the owner of all of the partnership interest in placedo partners ltd 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including any general and administrative costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
the company records depletion of its full cost pool using the unit of production method 
to the extent that such capitalized costs in the full cost pool net of depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net after tax cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  such excess costs are charged to operations 
at december   the company recorded a full cost ceiling test write down of its oil and natural gas properties of million primarily as a result of declines in product pricing and revisions to prior estimates of proved reserves 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for increased to million from million in production volumes for natural gas in increased to mmcf from  mmcf in realized average natural gas prices decreased to per mcf in from per mcf in production volumes for oil in increased to mbbls from mbbls in the increase in oil production was due primarily to the jones branch acquisition during the fourth quarter of and the completion of the matagorda project wells in the second half of natural gas production increased primarily as a result of the jones branch acquisition  the completion of the matagorda project area wells and the cedar point project area well in the second half of offset by the natural decline of existing wells

oil and natural gas operating expenses for increased to million from million in oil and natural gas operating expenses increased primarily as a result of the addition of new oil and gas wells drilled and completed since december  offset by a reduction in costs on older producing fields 
operating expenses per equivalent unit in decreased to 
per mcfe from 
per mcfe in the per unit cost decreased primarily as a result of the addition of new wells with high production rates during and the implementation of cost control measures in certain oil producing fields offset by decreased production of natural gas as wells naturally decline 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for increased nine percent to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the increased amortization of deferred loan costs  increased production and additional seismic and drilling costs offset by the lower asset base resulting from the ceiling test write down in the fourth quarter of primarily as a result of quantity revisions and depressed commodity prices  the company recorded a write down of oil and gas properties of million in prior to and during the company was not required to record any such write downs 
general and administrative expense for decreased to million from million for reflecting the cost control measures implemented in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  for increased to  from  in this increase was primarily due to higher interest expense in which was not available to be capitalized 
the company expects future interest costs to increase as a result of its issuance of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes in december income tax benefits changed from million to million based on improvements in the expected results which influence future taxable income 
the company adjusted its valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of on net operating loss carryforwards expected to be realized which resulted in a deferred income tax benefit of million 
dividends and accretion of discount on preferred stock decreased to million in from in as a result of the redemption of preferred stock in the fourth quarter of as a result of this redemption  no future charges will be accrued 
net income for increased to million from a loss of million in as a result of the factors described above 
the redemption of the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred stock at a discount resulted in a credit of  which is included in net income available to common shareholders  net of stock dividends paid to the holders of the preferred stock of  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for decreased to million from million in production volumes for natural gas in decreased to  mmcf from  mmcf in average natural gas prices decreased to per mcf in from per mcf in production volumes for oil in increased to mbbls from mbbls in average oil prices decreased to per barrel in from per barrel in the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and operating revenues for the company s oil and natural gas operations for the years ended december  and period compared to period december  increase increase decrease decrease production volumes oil and condensate mbbls natural gas mmcf   average sales prices oil and condensate per bbl natural gas per mcf operating revenues oil and condensate    natural gas    total    including impact of hedging

dd a expense for increased to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the increased production  additional land  seismic and drilling costs 
primarily as a result of quantity revisions and depressed commodity prices  the company recorded a write down of oil and gas properties of million in general and administrative expense for increased to million from million for reflecting ramp up expenses relating to the hiring of additional technical and administrative staff to handle the company s increased level of exploration activities and operations as well as other costs related to being a public company 
interest expense for decreased to  from  in this decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense in which allowed a larger percentage of the interest to be capitalized 
as a result of the adoption of sfas in the second quarter of  the company recorded a one time non cash charge to income of million to establish a deferred tax liability 
dividends and accretion of discount on preferred stock increased to million in from none in as a result of the sale of preferred stock in the first quarter of net income for decreased to a loss of million from income of  in as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company has made and will be required to make oil and gas capital expenditures substantially in excess of its net cash flow from operations in order to complete the exploration and development of its existing properties 
the company will require additional sources of financing to fund drilling expenditures on properties currently owned by the company and to fund leasehold costs and geological and geophysical cost on its activities exploration projects 
while the company believes that the recent financing consummated in december see financing arrangements below will provide sufficient capital to carry out the company s exploration plans  management of the company continues to seek financing for its capital program from a variety of sources 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to obtain additional financing on terms that would be acceptable to the company 
the company s inability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the company 
without raising additional capital  the company anticipates that it may be required to limit or defer its planned oil and gas exploration and development program  which could adversely affect the recoverability and ultimate value of the company s oil and gas properties 
the company s primary sources of liquidity have included proceeds from the initial public offering from the december sale of subordinated notes  common stock and warrants  the sale of shares of preferred stock and warrants  funds generated by operations  equity capital contributions  borrowings  primarily under revolving credit facilities and the palace agreement 
cash flows provided by operations after changes in working capital were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operations in as compared to was due primarily to decreases in commodity prices 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operations in as compared to was due primarily to the decrease in current liabilities offset by increases in commodity prices 
the company has budgeted capital expenditures in of approximately million of which is expected to be used to fund d seismic surveys and land acquisitions and million of which is expected to be used for drilling activities in the company s project areas 
the company has budgeted to drill approximately gross wells net in the actual number of wells drilled and capital expended is dependent upon available financing  cash flow  drilling rigs and other factors 
the company has continued to reinvest a substantial portion of its cash flows into increasing its d prospect portfolio  improving its d seismic interpretation technology and funding its drilling program 
oil and gas capital expenditures were million  and million for  and  respectively 
the company s drilling efforts resulted in the successful completion of gross wells net in  gross wells net in and gross wells net in financing arrangements in connection with the offering  carrizo entered into an amended revolving credit facility with compass bank the company credit facility to provide for a maximum loan amount of million  subject to borrowing base limitations 
the principal outstanding is due and payable in january  with interest due monthly 
the company credit facility was amended in march to provide for a maximum loan amount under such facility of million 
the interest rate on all revolving credit loans is calculated  at the company s option  at a floating rate based on the compass index rate or libor plus percent 
the company s obligations are secured by substantially all of its oil and gas properties and cash or cash equivalents included in the borrowing base 
certain members of the board of directors have provided collateral  primarily in the form of marketable securities  to secure the revolving credit loans 
as of march   the aggregate amount of this collateral was approximately million 
under the company credit facility  compass  in its sole discretion  will make semiannual borrowing base determinations based upon the proved oil and natural gas properties of the company 
compass may also redetermine the borrowing base and the monthly borrowing base reduction at any time at its discretion 
the company may also request borrowing base redeterminations in additions to the required semiannual reviews at the company s cost 
in december  the company credit facility was amended to provide for a term loan of million  bearing interest at the index rate 
the amount outstanding under the million term loan as of december  was million  which was repaid in january in september   the company credit facility was further amended to provide for an additional million term loan bearing interest at the index rate  of which million was borrowed in the fourth quarter of in march  the company credit facility was further amended to increase the million term loan by million 
in december  million principal amount of the term loan was repaid with proceeds from the sale from the subordinated notes  common stock and warrants 
certain members of the board of directors have guaranteed the term loan 
as currently amended pursuant to an amendment dated december  interest on the term loan is payable monthly  bearing interest at the index rate 
unless preceded by the term loan maturity date as defined below  principal payments on the term loan are not due until june   whereupon the term loan is repayable in consecutive monthly installments in the amount  each  beginning july  through december   and thereafter in the amount of  beginning january  until the term loan maturity date  when the entire principal balance  plus interest  is payable 
term loan maturity date means the earlier of the date of closing of the issuance of additional equity of the company  if the net proceeds of such issuance are sufficient to repay in full the term loan  the date of closing of the issuance of convertible subordinated debt of the company  if the proceeds of such issuance are sufficient to repay in full the term loan  the date of repayment of the revolving credit loans and the termination of the revolving commitment  and july  the company is subject to certain covenants under the terms of the company credit facility  including but not limited to a maintenance of specified tangible net worth  b a ratio of quarterly ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to quarterly debt service of not less than to  and c a specified minimum amount of working capital 
the company credit facility also places restrictions on  among other things  a incurring additional indebtedness  guaranties  loans and liens  b changing the nature of business or business structure  c selling assets and d paying dividends 
proceeds of the revolving credit loans have been used to provide funding for exploration and development activity 
at december   and  outstanding revolving credit loans totaled  and  respectively  with an additional  and  respectively  available for future borrowings 
the outstanding amount of the term loan was  at december  and the company credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit  one of which has been issued for  at december  and the weighted average interest rates for and on the company credit facility were and percent  respectively 
in november  messrs

copita  a orri in sts  a orri in usx hematite  a orri in huebner and a orri in buckhart on december  the bridge loan was repaid in its entirety with proceeds from the sale of common stock  subordinated notes and warrants 
such overriding royalty interests are limited to the well bore and proportionately reduced to the company s working interest in the well 
in december  the company consummated the sale of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the subordinated notes to an investor group led by cb capital investors  lp which included certain members of the board of directors

concurrent with the sale of the notes  the company consummated the sale of  shares of common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
for accounting purposes  the warrants are valued at per warrant 
the sale was made to an investor group led by cb capital investors  lp which included certain members of the board of directors 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire in december the company is subject to certain covenants under the terms under the related securities purchase agreement  including but not limited to  a maintenance of a specified tangible net worth  b maintenance of a ratio of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes depreciation and amortization to quarterly debt service as defined in the agreement of not less than to  and c limit its capital expenditures to a specified amount for the year ended december   and thereafter to an amount equal to the company s ebitda for the immediately prior fiscal year as well as limits on the company s ability to i incur indebtedness  ii incur or allow liens  iii engage in mergers  consolidations  sales of assets and acquisitions  iv declare dividends and effect certain distributions including restrictions on distributions upon the common stock  v engage in transactions with affiliates  vi make certain repayments and prepayments  including any prepayment of the company s term loan  any subordinated debt  indebtedness that is guaranteed or credit enhanced by any affiliate of the company  and prepayments that effect certain permanent reductions in revolving credit facilities

in january  the company consummated the sale of  shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to affiliates of enron corp 
the net proceeds received by the company from this transaction were approximately million and were used primarily for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities in texas and louisiana and to repay related indebtedness 
the preferred stock provided for annual cumulative dividends of per share  payable quarterly in cash or  at the option of the company until january   in additional shares of preferred stock 
dividend payments for the months ended december  were made by the issuance of an additional  shares of preferred stock 
in december  the company consummated the repurchase of all the outstanding shares of preferred stock and  warrants for million 
at the same time  the company reduced the exercise price of the remaining  warrants from per share to per share 
ability to manage growth and achieve business strategy the company s growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s financial  technical  operational and administrative resources 
the company has relied in the past and expects to continue to rely on project partners and independent contractors that have provided the company with seismic survey planning and management  project and prospect generation  land acquisition  drilling and other services 
at december   the company had full time employees 
there will be additional demands on the company s financial  technical  operational and administrative resources and continued reliance by the company on project partners and independent contractors  and these strains on resources  additional demands and continued reliance may negatively affect the company 
the company s ability to grow will depend upon a number of factors  including its ability to obtain leases or options on properties for d seismic surveys  its ability to acquire additional d seismic data  its ability to identify and acquire new exploratory sites  its ability to develop existing sites  its ability to continue to retain and attract skilled personnel  its ability to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors  the results of its drilling program  hydrocarbon prices  access to capital and other factors 
although the company intends to continue to upgrade its technical  operational and administrative resources and to increase its ability to provide internally certain of the services previously provided by outside sources  there can be no assurance that it will be successful in doing so or that it will be able to continue to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors 
the failure of the company to continue to upgrade its technical  operational and administrative resources or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties  including difficulties in recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to enable the company to expand its seismic data acquisition and drilling program  or the reduced availability of project partners and independent contractors that have historically provided the company seismic survey planning and management  project and prospect generation  land acquisition  drilling and other services  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company has only limited experience operating and managing field operations  and there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in doing so 
any increase in the company s activities as an operator will increase its exposure to operating hazards 
see business and properties operating hazards and insurance 
the company s lack of capital will also constrain its ability to grow and achieve its business strategy 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in achieving growth or any other aspect of its business strategy 
recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  a company may also implement the statement as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance 
statement no 
cannot be applied retroactively 
statement no 
must be applied to a derivative instruments and b certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued  acquired  or substantively modified after december  and  at the company s election  before january  the company routinely enters into financial instrument contracts to hedge price risks associated with the sale of crude oil and natural gas 
statement no 
amends  modifies and supercedes significantly all of the authoritative literature governing the accounting for and disclosure of derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
as a result  adoption of statement no 
will impact the accounting for and disclosure of the company s operations 
the company intends to adopt the provisions of such statement in accordance with the requirements provided by the statement 
management is currently assessing the financial statement impact  however  such impact is not ascertainable at this time 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices the company s revenues  future rate of growth  results of operations  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of its properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile  and such markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions in the middle east  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price of foreign imports and overall economic conditions 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with certainty 
declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect the company s financial condition  liquidity  and ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations 
lower oil and natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that the company can produce economically 
oil and natural gas prices have declined in the recent past and there can be no assurance that prices will recover or will not decline further 
see business and properties marketing 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the commission 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at 
application of this ceiling test generally requires pricing future revenue at the unescalated prices in effect as of the end of each fiscal quarter and requires a write down for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded  even if prices were depressed for only a short period of time 
the company may be required to write down the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or unusually volatile 
on december   the company recorded a full cost ceiling test write down of its oil and natural gas properties of million because its carrying cost of proved reserves was in excess of the present value of estimated future net revenues from those reserves 
if additional write downs are required  they would result in additional charges to earnings  but would not impact cash flow from operating activities 
once incurred  a write down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
in order to reduce its exposure to short term fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas  the company periodically enters into hedging arrangements 
the company s hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of its production and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices 
such hedging arrangements may expose the company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected  the company s customers fail to purchase contracted quantities of oil or natural gas or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
in addition  the company s hedging arrangements limit the benefit to the company of increases in the price of oil and natural gas 
total natural gas purchased and sold under swap arrangements during the years ended december   and were bbls  bbls and  bbls  respectively  and  mmbtu   mmbtu and  mmbtu  respectively 
income and losses realized by the company under such swap arrangements were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company had outstanding no hedge positions as of december  at december   the company had  mmbtu and  bbls of outstanding hedge positions at an average price of per mmbtu and per bbl for january through june see business and properties marketing 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk commodity risk 
the company s major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to its oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing volatility have been discussed above  and such volatility is expected to continue 
a fluctuation in the price received for oil and gas production would have an approximate million impact on the company s annual revenues and operating income 
to mitigate some of this risk  the company engages periodically in certain limited hedging activities but only to the extent of buying protection price floors 
costs and any benefits derived from these price floors are accordingly recorded as a reduction or increase  as applicable  in oil and gas sales revenue and were not significant for any year presented 
the costs to purchase put options are amortized over the option period 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
income and losses realized by the company related to these instruments were  and  and  or  and and per mmbtu for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates results from its floating rate debt 
in regards to its revolving credit facility  the result of a fluctuation in short term interest rates would impact cash flow by approximately  financial instruments debt maturities 
the company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings and subordinated notes payable 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of the bank and vendor borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon interest rates currently available to the company for borrowings with similar terms 
maturities of the debt are  in   in   in and the balance in
