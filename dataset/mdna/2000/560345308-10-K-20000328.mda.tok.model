item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we commenced our restaurant operations in may with the acquisition of four tgi friday s restaurants in arizona and nevada 
during the past nine years  we have grown through acquisitions and development of new restaurants 
we currently own restaurants and manage an additional six restaurants 
during  we had a change in management and implemented a long term business strategy to enhance our financial position  to place more emphasis on our casual dining business in certain designated areas  and to dispose of underperforming assets 
the first step was to strengthen our financial position 
this was accomplished by i the sale of  shares of common stock for  through a private placement transaction in january  ii the sale of five restaurants in northern california in january for  of which  in proceeds were used to repay debt see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements  and iii new borrowings of  with a repayment period of years 
proceeds from the new borrowings were used primarily to pay off debt with shorter repayment periods see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also renegotiated our development agreements with carlson worldwide to reduce the number of tgi friday s restaurants we are required to build with the intent to focus on those development territories that are most economically favorable see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we recorded net restructuring and reorganization gains of  in and  in related to the disposition of various non core assets and the write down of certain core assets to realizable values see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
our strategy is to reduce operating costs and expand our restaurant operations 
this will entail continuing to build tgi friday s and redfish restaurants and evaluating other concepts in the casual dining segment

labor costs increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in this increase was primarily due to increased staffing needs during the initial months of operation for newly opened restaurants 
once a restaurant has reached operating maturity  labor costs as a percentage of revenue will be normalized 
additionally  during we implemented a program to increase our restaurant management staff in many of our restaurants from four to five managers 
this increase in management staff is intended to reduce turnover by improving the quality of life of our managers  which we believe will ultimately lead to lower labor costs 
other operating expenses include rent  real estate taxes  common area maintenance charges  advertising  insurance  maintenance  and utilities 
in addition  the franchise agreements between carlson worldwide and our company require a royalty and a contribution to a national marketing pool of up to of gross sales  although we were only required to contribute for other operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the increases were due primarily to additional marketing and promotional costs 
in total  depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the decrease was due primarily to the relatively fixed nature of these expenses as compared with our increased revenue

at december   we had approximately  of net operating and capital loss carryforwards to be used to offset future income for income tax purposes 
we have determined that a valuation allowance is appropriate on the net operating loss as a result of our current restaurant expansion plans 
we will re evaluate the need for a valuation allowance at each quarter 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenue for the fiscal year ended december  increased to  as compared with  for the fiscal year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the acquisition of six restaurants in may  the development of three new restaurants during the year  and an increase in same store sales of for the year

also included in other operating expenses is a royalty fee paid to carlson worldwide pursuant to the franchise agreements  as well as payments to a national marketing fund managed by the franchisor 
the franchise agreements require us to pay up to of revenue to this marketing fund  although we were required to only pay approximately in the decrease in other operating expenses is attributable to lower insurance costs and to our on going cost reduction efforts in supply  maintenance  and advertising costs 
depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue to in as compared with in due primarily to amortization of pre opening costs of three new restaurants developed in  as well as additional depreciation associated with these three new restaurants and the six northern california restaurants purchased in may general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue remain unchanged at for both and interest expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to  or of revenue  in as compared with  or of revenue  in this decrease was primarily due to the capitalization of financing costs associated with restaurants developed during additionally  the percentage decrease is attributable to the relatively fixed nature of these financing costs as compared with increasing revenues from to no income tax provision was recorded in or due to the availability of net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources our primary use of funds over the past five years has been for the acquisition of existing tgi friday s restaurants and exclusive development rights 
these acquisitions were financed principally through the issuance of long term debt and common stock 
we have also expended funds for the development of new restaurants 
during  we also purchased the minority interest in redfish america  llc for  in cash 
the principal source of these funds has been operating cash flow  supplemented by bank and lease financing 
net cash flows from operating activities were  in   in  and  in these were supplemented by net cash flows from financing of  in and  in  which we used to fund our acquisitions and development of new restaurants 
in  we used  of net cash flows from financing activities  which came primarily from the sale of assets 
our current liabilities exceed our current assets due in part to cash expended on our development requirements and because the restaurant business receives substantially immediate payment for sales  while payables related to inventories and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms  usually to days 
at december   we had a deficit in working capital of approximately  due primarily to an increase in accounts payable related to restaurant development costs for projects in progress  as well as recently completed restaurants 
subsequent to december   we reduced a significant portion of our working capital deficit through long term borrowings under the financing commitments described below 
at december  we had a cash balance of  monthly cash receipts have been sufficient to pay all obligations as they become due 
at december   we had long term debt of  and current portion of long term debt of  approximately  of this debt is a term loan comprised of five notes payable to one lender 
three of the notes bear interest at per annum and two of the notes bear interest at the one month libor rate plus basis points 
the notes are payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest that total approximately  per month 
the notes mature on may  during april  we obtained a million revolving line of credit with another lender 
the line of credit is available to finance construction and other costs associated with developing new restaurants 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at prime plus basis points 
the line of credit includes covenants related to our net worth  fixed charge coverage ratio  profitability  and access to capital 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  the line of credit matures on july  at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit 
during november  we entered into two working capital reducing revolver loan agreements with another lender 
one agreement provides for a maximum of  to finance of the costs to develop seven tgi friday s restaurants 
borrowings under this agreement will mature in years 
these borrowings are secured by the assets financed with the borrowings and are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries 
the other agreement provides for a maximum of  to finance of the costs to furnish and equip seven tgi friday s restaurants

we were in compliance with these covenants at december  the remainder of our long term debt consists of notes payable to various lending institutions 
these notes bear interest at rates ranging from to and mature at various times over the next years 
we plan to develop at least additional restaurants over the next year 
subsequent to december   we borrowed a total of  under the credit arrangements described above or new credit arrangements that we entered into after december  we used the proceeds of these borrowings to fund unpaid development costs recorded as accounts payable at december  as of march   we have permanent debt and sale leaseback financing agreements or commitments totaling approximately  that we will use to fund restaurant development activity and working capital requirements through the remainder of we lease all of our restaurants with terms ranging from to years 
minimum payments on our existing lease obligations are approximately million per year through we believe that our current resources  our lines of credit  and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our capital needs during the next months at our current level of operations  apart from capital needs resulting from additional developed restaurants or acquisitions 
we may be required to obtain additional capital to fund our planned growth during the next to months and beyond 
potential sources of any such capital may include bank financing  strategic alliances  and additional offerings of our equity or debt securities 
we cannot provide assurance that such capital will be available from these or other potential sources  and the lack of capital could have a material adverse effect on our business 
year compliance in  we began identifying those most critical areas that might not be year compliant and established a time line to complete the necessary analysis and remediation plans 
we have completed the remediation plans and believe we have corrected any deficiencies identified in all affected areas 
as of the filing date of this report  we have not experienced any material disruption to our operations as a result of any failure of any of our systems to function properly as of january  we also have not experienced any year failures related to any of our significant vendors or suppliers 
year compliance has many elements and potential consequences  some of which may not be foreseeable or may be realized in future periods 
in addition  unforeseen circumstances may arise  and we may not in the future identify equipment or systems that are not year compliant
