overview maritrans serves the petroleum and petroleum product distribution industry by using oil tankers  tank barges and tugboats to provide marine transportation services primarily along the east and gulf coasts of the united states 
between and  maritrans has transported at least million barrels annually 
the high was million barrels in  and the low was million barrels in many factors affect the number of barrels transported and will affect future results for maritrans 
such factors include maritrans vessel and fleet size and average trip lengths  the continuation of federal law restricting united states point to point maritime shipping to us vessels the jones act  domestic oil consumption  environmental laws and regulations  oil companies operating and sourcing decisions  competition  labor and training costs and liability insurance costs 
overall us oil consumption during fluctuated between million and million barrels a day 
in  the company made several strategic moves in order to focus on those markets where it believes it possesses a long term competitive advantage and which should provide additional opportunities 
as a result  the company sold two small tug and barge units  which were working in puerto rico  two petroleum storage terminals in philadelphia  pa and salisbury  md  and twenty seven vessels working primarily in the northeastern united states 
prior to their sales  the sold vessels had transported approximately million barrels in and had represented approximately percent of revenues 
in  maritrans successfully rebuilt one of its existing  single hulled   barrel barges with a double hull design configuration  which complies with the provisions of the oil pollution act of opa 
prefabrication has already commenced on a second single hull barge  the ocean that is scheduled to be in the shipyard in the spring and summer of the company intends to apply the same methodology to up to seven more of its existing large  oceangoing  single hull barges 
the timing of the rebuilds will be determined by a number of factors  including market conditions  shipyard pricing and availability  customer requirements and opa retirement dates for the vessels 
the opa retirement dates fall between and each of the company s superbarges represent approximately to percent of the total fleet capacity  which will be removed from revenue generating service during the rebuilding of that vessel 
legislation the enactment of opa significantly increased the liability exposure of marine transporters of petroleum in the event of an oil spill 
in addition  several states in which maritrans operates have enacted legislation increasing the liability for oil spills in their waters 
maritrans currently maintains oil pollution liability insurance of up to one billion dollars per occurrence on each of its vessels 
there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover potential liabilities in the event of a catastrophic spill  that additional premium costs will be recoverable through increased vessel charter rates  or that such insurance will continue to be available in satisfactory amounts 
opa has increased other operating costs as maritrans has taken steps to minimize the risk of spills 
among such costs are those for additional training  safety and contingency programs  these expenses have not yet been  and may never be  fully recovered through increased vessel charter rates 
additionally  management believes that the legislation has reduced the total volume of waterborne petroleum transportation because shippers of petroleum have tried to limit their exposure to opa liability 
opa has had a material adverse effect on maritrans operations  financial performance and expectations 
opa is expected to continue having negative effects on the entire us oil and marine petroleum transportation industry  including maritrans 
these negative effects include i increased capital expenditures to cover the cost of mandated double hulled vessels  ii continued increased maintenance  training  insurance and other operating costs  iii increased liability and exposure to civil penalties and iv decreased operating revenues as a result of further reductions in volumes transported on vessels 
these effects could adversely affect maritrans financial condition  profitability and liquidity 
opa requires all newly constructed petroleum tank vessels engaged in marine transportation of oil and petroleum products in the us to be double hulled and gradually phases out the operation of single hulled tank vessels  based on size and age  operating in us waters  including most of maritrans existing barges 
five of maritrans large oceangoing  single hulled barges will be affected on january  currently three of maritrans barges and two tankers are equipped with double hulls meeting opa s requirements 
maritrans has initiated a program to rebuild its single hull tank barges to comply with opa 
this rebuilding relies upon a process of computer assisted design and prefabrication  for which maritrans has applied for a patent 
the first rebuilt barge  the maritrans  was completed and entered service in november work has already commenced on a second single hull barge  the ocean the cost of rebuilding single hull barges is approximately per barrel compared to estimated costs of approximately per barrel for construction of a completely new double hull barge 
the total cost of rebuilding the company s entire single hull fleet is expected to exceed million 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues for of million were flat compared to million in barrels of cargo transported in decreased from million in to million in although barrels decreased  overall vessel utilization  including changes in the structure of the fleet  increased from percent in to percent in revenue increased as a result of the  barrel oil tanker which went into operation late in the current year results reflect the first complete year of operations for that tanker 
additionally  positively affecting revenues were a high level of contract business and a temporary increase in demand due to west coast refinery disruptions 
offsetting this increase was the sale of a significant number of vessels and terminals during the company sold five vessels in the first quarter of and sold the petroleum storage terminals in september  all of which were operating in in december  the company completed the sale of twenty six vessels most of which had worked in the northeast united states 
since this transaction occurred late in the year  revenue was affected only in december 
this transaction represented approximately twenty five percent of the company s cargo carrying capacity 
compared to  utilization improved as the maritrans returned to service after being rebuilt with a new internal double hull 
utilization of the remaining fleet  after vessel divestitures  was percent in compared to percent in total costs and operating expenses were million in compared to million in  an increase of million or percent 
this increase was due to the addition to the fleet of the  barrel oil tanker late in  costs associated with turnover of qualified seagoing personnel and crew costs associated with vessels returning to service in  which had been in the shipyard during related periods in additionally  the company recorded a severance charge of million  in the third quarter of  for the impact of company s reduction of shoreside staff  which was announced in september these increases were offset by a reduction in operating costs as a result of the disposition of vessels and terminals discussed in revenue above 
operating income decreased as a result of the aforementioned changes in revenue and expenses 
other income increased from million in to million in this increase includes a gain of million on the disposition of vessels and the petroleum storage terminals in the vessel sales consisted of seventeen barges and fourteen tugboats 
the tug and barge units were predominantly working in the northeastern united states and puerto rico 
the company s effective income tax rate increased from in to in the increase in the effective tax rate is due primarily to the impact of state taxes on certain asset sales in net income for the twelve months ended december   increased to million from million for the twelve months ended december   due primarily to the gain on the sale of assets 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for totaled million compared with million in  an increase of million or percent 
barrels of cargo transported increased by million  from million to million or percent 
revenue and volumes in were positively impacted by the addition of three tankers and two tug barge units in late and one tanker in utilization  as measured by revenue days divided by calendar days available  totaled percent for compared to percent in utilization for the fleet  excluding new vessels  decreased to percent 
the fleet utilization has been impacted by a heavier than normal out of service time due to scheduled maintenance and the maritrans double hull rebuild project 
additionally  the fleet utilization was impacted by higher than normal weather delays in both the gulf of mexico and northeastern united states  two of the company s largest markets 
management expects market conditions to continue to be very competitive as maritrans competitors are introducing new tonnage into the market 
revenues from sources other than marine transportation decreased to percent of total revenues in compared to percent in costs and operating expenses of million increased by million or percent from million in this increase was due largely to the full year s operating costs of three tankers and two tug barges units acquired late in and the stub period operating costs of the tanker purchased in august additionally  the company had to charter in outside tonnage  due to an extensive maintenance schedule during the year and the maritrans double hull rebuild project  to cover contract commitments to customers 
the company s oil tankers have a higher operating cost  measured per barrel of capacity  than its tug barge units  due primarily to their larger crew complements and higher ongoing maintenance expenses 
expenses  excluding the new vessels  decreased reflecting lower utilization due to maintenance  heavier weather delays and fuel price savings 
general and administrative expenses increased reflecting higher staffing levels  shoreside travel and shoreside training 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in this decrease is the result of a reduction in the effective interest rate as the mortgage debt of subsidiaries is replaced by debt on the company s revolving credit facility 
the company also capitalized interest in the amount of million on various capital projects 
other income decreased from million in  to million in comparable amounts for included a net gain of million on the disposal of certain assets 
interest income decreased to million as the company had less cash and cash equivalents on hand due to its asset acquisitions and capital projects 
net income for the twelve months ended december   decreased to million from million for the twelve months ended december   due to the aforementioned changes in revenue and expenses 
liquidity and capital resources in  funds provided by operating activities were sufficient to meet debt service obligations and loan agreements restrictions  to make capital acquisitions and improvements and to allow maritrans inc to pay a dividend in each quarter of the year 
while dividends have been made quarterly in each of the two last years  there can be no assurances that the dividend will continue 
the ratio of total debt to capitalization is 
at december   compared to 
at december  the indenture governing the operating partnership s long term debt permits cash distributions by maritrans operating partners lp to maritrans inc  so long as no default exists under the indenture and provided that such distributions do not exceed contractually prescribed amounts
