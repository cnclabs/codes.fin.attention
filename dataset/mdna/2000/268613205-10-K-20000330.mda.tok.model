the company s review of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance indicated that it is more likely than not that additional carryforward tax benefits will be realized  due to the company s historical  continued and increasing profitability and the significantly reduced possibility of an ownership change brought about as a result of a negotiated standstill agreement entered into in with a significant stockholder see the company s most recent proxy statement for further information 
accordingly  and taking into account reasonable and prudent tax planning strategies and future income projections  the company reduced the valuation allowance by  during the resulting net deferred tax asset of  represents the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that management believes more likely than not will be realized over their remaining life

the utilization of the company s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be impaired or reduced under certain circumstances 
events which may affect these carryforwards include  but are not limited to  cumulative stock ownership changes of or more over a three year period  as defined  the ability of the company to realize budgeted future taxable income  and the timing of the utilization of the tax benefit carryforwards 
such changes in ownership would significantly restrict the company s ability to utilize loss and credit carryforwards in accordance with sections and of the internal revenue code irc 
management recognizes that it is limited in its ability to prevent such cumulative changes in ownership from occurring 
if a change of ownership were to occur and no assurance can be given that one will not occur factors such as the number of common shares issued and outstanding  the market price of such shares  and short term treasury rates  would be used under the current tax laws to determine the amount of the tax loss and credit carryforwards that can be utilized each year recording the deferred tax benefit in resulted in an increase in net income and basic earnings per share of  and diluted earnings per share  respectively

interest expense decreased by  or  in compared to year compliance during  the company successfully resolved all of its year issues also known as the yk issue  which are the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  these programs may not have properly recognized the year and subsequent dates and errors may have resulted 
the company instituted procedures to identify these computer programs as well as any non information technology systems in place and modify or replace such systems so that they would function properly in the year during  the restaurant division installed new accounting systems that are fully operational and are year compliant 
individual restaurant locations do not currently utilize point of sale registers and therefore computer programming changes are not required 
peripheral hardware and software and equipment at each restaurant location and the restaurant s head office were evaluated and corrected for year compliance 
during  cues completed the modifications to its manufacturing and accounting software  which is the critical component for the planning  purchasing  manufacturing and sale of its products 
all known functions within the software were rewritten to be year compliant 
within various departments  cues also utilizes computer hardware and peripheral programs that are separate and distinct from the accounting and manufacturing software 
examples include programs related to engineering design  spreadsheets  word processing  and sales database tracking 
while not as critical to the ongoing nature of the business  cues assessed the effect of yk on each hardware and software component and made all necessary changes by the end of september cues does not utilize any computer aided machinery in its production process 
the company initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company was vulnerable to potential third parties failures to remediate their own year issues 
the company expensed the costs to modify or replace computer applications  the majority of which were handled internally utilizing its normal information technology budget and personnel 
the company did not experience any significant increases in costs due to year conversions nor did it experience a decrease in the information technology budget upon completion of the conversion efforts 
the company will continue to incur salary expense  while the efforts of personnel will be directed towards other ongoing information technology projects in although the company believes that it successfully avoided any significant disruption from the year issue relating to the century rollover and leap year  it will continue to monitor all critical systems for the appearance of delayed complications or disruptions  problems encountered through suppliers  customers and other third parties with whom the company deals 
although these and other unanticipated year issues could have an adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company  it is not possible to anticipate the extent of impact at this time
