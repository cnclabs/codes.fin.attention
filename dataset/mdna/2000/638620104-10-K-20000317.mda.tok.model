these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the statements 
these risks and uncertainties include without limitation the following the effect of economic and market conditions and changes in interest rates  government regulations  including changes in medicare and medicaid payment levels  changes in the healthcare industry  the amount of any additional investments  access to capital markets and changes in the ratings of the company s debt securities 
operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  minimum rent increased  or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to minimum rent resulting from the developments completed during  combined with a full year of revenues earned by investments in additional facilities in interest and other income increased by  or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to approximately  of working capital loans provided during additional rent and additional interest increased by  or in as compared to the increase was attributable to increased additional rent and additional interest as provided in the company s existing leases and mortgage loans receivable based on increases in the facility revenues or the consumer price index 
interest and amortization of deferred financing costs increased  or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to the issuance of  in medium term notes during  a full year of interest expense related to the issuance of  of medium term notes in and a rise in interest rates during depreciation and non cash charges increased  or in as compared to the increase was attributable to increased depreciation due to the developments completed in and a full year of depreciation related to facilities acquired in general and administrative costs increased  or in as compared to due to general cost increases and additional costs associated with the company s larger asset base 
the company expects increased rental revenues and interest income due to the addition of facilities to its property base and mortgage loans receivable over the last twelve months 
the company also expects increased additional rent and additional interest at individual facilities because the company s leases and mortgages generally contain provisions under which additional rents or interest income increase with increases in facility revenues and or increases in the consumer price index 
historically  revenues at the company s facilities and the consumer price index generally have increased  although there are no assurances that they will continue to increase in the future 
sales of facilities or repayments of mortgages would serve to offset the aforementioned revenue increases 
in addition  the company is currently negotiating a new lease with beverly enterprises  inc beverly which will incorporate of their current facilities leases  the majority of which are up for renewal in the other facilities are on a separate lease that does not expire until the new lease will have new base rent amounts for each facility that will generally incorporate the former additional rents 
this will result in a shift in revenues from additional rent to base rent 
the new lease will probably result in a decrease in total rent from beverly as it is likely that beverly will purchase facilities from the company and certain rent concessions will probably be made with regard to a few specific facilities 
additional investments in health care facilities would also increase rental and or interest income 
as additional investments in facilities are made  depreciation and or interest expense could also increase 
any such increases  however  are expected to be at least partially offset by rents or interest income associated with the investments 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  minimum rent increased  or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to minimum rent resulting from investments in net additional leased facilities in  combined with a full year of revenues earned by investments in additional facilities in interest and other income increased by  or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to the increase in mortgage loans during additional rent and additional interest increased by  or in as compared to the increase was attributable to increased additional rent and additional interest as provided in the company s existing leases and mortgage loans receivable based on increases in the facility revenues or the consumer price index 
interest and amortization of deferred financing costs increased  or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to the issuance of  in medium term notes during and a full year of interest expense related to the issuance of  of medium term notes in depreciation and non cash charges increased  or in as compared to the increase was attributable to increased depreciation due to the acquisition of additional facilities in and a full year of depreciation related to facilities acquired in general and administrative costs increased  or in as compared to the increase was due in part to adding two additional employees  increased wages and increases in other general expenses 
the impairment of long lived assets was due to recording a provision of  as a reduction in the carrying amount of the company s investment in three medical clinics that were constructed for and leased to a company that has declared bankruptcy 
information regarding certain operators three of the companies that operate facilities owned by the company have filed for bankruptcy protection 
the table below summarizes the filing dates of the bankruptcies  the number of the company s facilities operated by each operator  the company s investment in facilities subject to the bankruptcies  the percentage of the company s revenue for relating to the facilities operated by each operator and cash deposits and letters of credit held by the company as security for each operator 
number of investment percentage bankruptcy facilities in of security operator filing date operated facilities revenue deposits sun healthcare group  inc october    mariner post acute network january    integrated health services  inc february    totals   the number of facilities and investment in facilities amounts above include investments in mortgage loans 
the company has one mortgage directly with mariner post acute network in the amount of  secured by facility 
the remaining mortgage loans  aggregating  are secured by facilities operated by sun healthcare group  inc and facilities operated by integrated health services 
the operators are not the borrowers under the non direct mortgage loans  and the borrowers are responsible for making the interest payments to the company 
the company s interest continues to be paid each month on a timely basis 
under bankruptcy statutes  the court must either affirm the company s lease or reject it and return the property to the company 
the court cannot change the rental amount or other lease provisions that could financially impact the company 
the likelihood that the company s leases would be affirmed rests primarily on whether the properties that are operated by the tenant are providing positive cash flows 
only a few of the fifty five facilities leased to and operated by these three companies are not providing adequate cash flows on their own to cover the rent under the leases 
the company s rent continues to be paid each month on a timely basis 
while there is a possibility that these properties may be returned by the courts  the company has already identified parties interested in leasing these facilities  however such leases would be at a slightly lower rental rate 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company acquired residential care facilities for the elderly in transaction for an aggregate investment of approximately  during  the company provided new construction financing of approximately  construction of assisted living facilities was completed in  in which the company s total aggregate investment was approximately   of this amount was a current year investment included in the new construction financing amount above 
upon acquisition or completion of construction  as applicable  the facilities were concurrently leased under terms generally similar to the company s existing leases 
during  the company also funded approximately  in capital improvements at certain facilities in accordance with certain existing lease provisions 
such capital improvements result in an increase in the minimum rents earned by the company on these facilities 
the acquisitions  construction advances and capital improvements were funded by bank borrowings on the company s bank line of credit and cash on hand 
during  the company provided mortgage loans secured by parcels of land in the aggregate amount of  in addition  the company funded an additional  on existing mortgage loans 
such additional amounts funded result in an increase in interest income earned by the company on these loans 
the mortgage loans and the additional amounts funded were financed by borrowings on the company s bank line of credit and by cash on hand 
during  the company disposed of skilled nursing facilities  assisted living facilities  residential care facilities for the elderly and medical clinics in separate transactions for aggregate proceeds of approximately  the company recognized an aggregate loss of  related to the disposal of these facilities 
the proceeds of the disposals were used to repay borrowings on the company s bank line of credit 
during  the company issued  in aggregate principal amount of medium term notes 
the notes bear fixed interest at a weighted average interest rate of and have a weighted average maturity of years 
the proceeds were used to repay borrowings on the company s bank line of credit

the company anticipates making additional investments in health care related facilities  although the level of new investments is decreasing and the company does not anticipate making additional investments beyond its current commitments until such time as access to long term capital is under more favorable terms 
financing for such future investments may be provided by borrowings under the company s bank line of credit  private placements or public offerings of debt or equity  and the assumption of secured indebtedness 
the company believes it has sufficient liquidity and financing capability to finance anticipated future investments as well as repay borrowings at or prior to their maturity 
year readiness disclosure update all statements contained in the following section are year readiness disclosures within the meaning of the year information and disclosure act 
the year issue the year issue in computers arose from the common industry practice of using two digits to represent a date in computer software code and databases to enhance both processing time and save storage space 
therefore  when dates in the year and beyond are indicated and computer programs read the date  the computers may default to the year rather than the correct this could result in incorrect calculations  faulty data and computer shutdowns  which could cause disruptions of operations 
during  the company reviewed the risks of the year issue with regard to the company s own internal operations  information systems and software applications and the impact on the company of its outside vendors  lessees and borrowers ability to operate 
during the second quarter of  unrelated to the year issue  the company replaced its entire computer system  which consists of a local area network of twelve personal computers and three servers 
the system was replaced to enable the company to upgrade its accounting software package  which was completed during the third quarter of the company believed its own internal operations  information systems and software applications were compliant based upon reasonable assurance by vendors and the company s information systems consultants 
the cost to remediate the year issues with regard to the company s internal operations  information systems and software applications was not material 
subsequent to january   the company has not experienced any hardware or software problems related to the year issue with regard to its own internal operations and systems 
the company s vendors that provide banking  communications and payroll services and the company s lessees and borrowers were also likely to be affected by the year issue 
if the company s vendors  lessees and borrowers were not year compliant  or if they faced disruptions in their operations or cash flows due to year issues  the company could have faced significant temporary disruptions in rent and mortgage payments and  therefore  cash flows after that date 
at this time  the company is not aware of any significant issues that may have impacted these vendors  lessees and borrowers  and there have been no disruptions in rent or mortgage payments 
the company also had risks associated with year issues in non information technology areas as it related to owned properties 
there was a risk that embedded chips in elevators  security systems  electrical systems and similar technology driven devices may have stopped functioning due to year issues 
substantially all of the company s owned properties are leased under triple net leases and as such  the cost to remediate any of these items was paid by the lessees 
at the current time  the company is unaware of any significant disruptions of these sorts at any of its owned properties 
at this time there have been no indications that the company s vendors  lessees  borrowers and third parties upon which they are dependent have experienced any year issues which would have a material impact on the future operations and or financial results of the company  and the company does not expect any future disruptions related to its vendors  lessees and borrowers 
readers are cautioned that many of the statements contained in the year readiness disclosure update paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading statement regarding forward looking disclosure set forth above 
impact of new accounting pronouncements the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities does not have an impact on the company s financial statements as the company does not utilize derivatives or engage in any hedging activities 
market risk exposure the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its mortgage loans receivable and debt 
the company does not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the purpose of the following analyses is to provide a framework to understand the company s sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  readers are cautioned that many of the statements contained in the market risk exposure paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading statement regarding forward looking disclosure set forth above 
the company provides mortgage loans to operators of healthcare facilities as part of its normal operations 
the majority of the loans have fixed rates 
four of the mortgage loans have adjustable rates  however  the rates adjust only once or twice over the loan lives and the minimum adjusted rate is equal to the current rate 
therefore  all mortgage loans receivable are treated as fixed rate notes in the table and analysis below 
the company utilizes debt financing primarily for the purpose of making additional investments in healthcare facilities 
historically  the company has made short term borrowings on its bank line of credit to fund its acquisitions until market conditions were appropriate  based on management s judgment  to issue stock or fixed rate debt to provide long term financing 
the company holds variable rate debt in the form of housing revenue bonds  which were assumed in connection with certain healthcare facility acquisitions because of the favorable interest rates  which in turn provided favorable lease rates to the sellers lessees 
pursuant to the associated lease arrangements  increases or decreases in the interest rates on the housing revenue bonds would be substantially offset by increases or decreases in the associated rent received by the company on the properties securing this debt 
therefore  there is substantially no market risk associated with the company s variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but not earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
the company generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until the company would be required to refinance such debt 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  and including the bank borrowings as variable rate debt due to its nature  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  the table below details the principal amount and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt for each category based on the final maturity dates 
certain of the mortgage loans receivable and certain items in the various categories of debt require periodic principal payments prior to the final maturity date 
the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to the company for debt of the same type and remaining maturity 
maturity date fair thereafter total value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans receivable      average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate bank borrowings    average interest rate increases in interest rates during resulted in an increase in interest expense for the company primarily related to the bank line of credit and medium term notes issued during the year at rates somewhat higher than in prior years 
these interest rate increases have made it more expensive for the company to borrow on its bank line of credit and to access debt capital through its medium term note program 
any future interest rate increases will further increase the cost of any borrowings to finance future acquisitions or replace current long term debt as it matures
