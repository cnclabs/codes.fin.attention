the majority of the increase in operating income from to was due to improved operations during for both the broadcasting and outdoor segments  which was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization 
the tangible and intangible assets associated with the above mentioned business acquisitions account for the majority of the increase in the as reported depreciation and amortization for over change in interest expense  taxes and net income interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding  which resulted from the above mentioned business combinations 
income tax expense increased primarily from the increase in the average effective tax rate from in to in the effective tax rate increased as a result of the increase in nondeductible amortization expenses principally associated with the acquisition of jacor 
the majority of the increase in net income from to was due to a million gain realized during relating to the divestiture of certain stations we were required to make by governmental directives regarding the jacor merger 
this was partially offset by the increase in interest expense for the year 
interest expense increased during as a result of greater average borrowing levels as a result of the aforementioned acquisitions  but was partially offset by lower average borrowing rates  in versus in our average borrowing rate was lowered in as a result of the issuance of senior convertible notes dated april  other income rose due to realized gains on the sale of available for sale marketable securities and was offset by charges related to the purchase of certain subsidiary options and losses on sale of assets

change in equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates equity earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates increased in over primarily due to the improvement in the operating results of hispanic broadcasting communications formerly known as heftel broadcasting  hbc and grupo acir comunicaciones  acir 
we own a equity interest in hbc and a equity interest in acir 
equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates increased in over due to the inclusion of several investments held by more group  which are accounted for under the equity method and the inclusion of a partial month of more group s operations  which was accounted for under the equity method prior to consolidation 
this was partially offset by the transfer of our investment in american tower corporation  which merged with american tower systems  inc in june  the result of which diluted our investment from to 
prospectively  we have accounted for this investment using the cost method 
the remainder of the increase in equity in earnings loss of nonconsolidated affiliates was due to the continued solid financial performance by hbc  of which we owned a equity interest

capital expenditures capital expenditures of million and million during and  respectively  included the following in millions broadcasting outdoor land and buildings broadcasting and other equipment display structures and other equipment new construction of display structures broadcasting the increase in our capital outlays for land and buildings were primarily related to one time expenditures for our new corporate headquarters and the consolidation of operations in certain markets in conjunction with the jacor merger which are expected to result in improved operating results in such markets

other accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
statement establishes new rules for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
statement is amended by statement accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 and is effective for years beginning after june  we plan to adopt this statement in fiscal year management does not believe adoption of this statement will materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for wages  salaries and equipment 
although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable  we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our broadcasting stations and outdoor display faces 
year in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and we believe those systems successfully responded to the year date changes 
we expensed approximately  during in connection with remediating our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   approximately of our long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our interest expense and earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a two percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have changed by million and that our net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the analysis assumes no such actions 
furthermore the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
we currently hedge a portion of our outstanding debt with interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest at rates from to on million of our current borrowings 
these agreements expire from april to december the fair value of these agreements at december  and settlements of interest during were not material 
equity price risk the carrying value of our available for sale equity securities is affected by changes in their quoted market prices 
it is estimated that a change in the market prices of these securities would change their carrying value at december  by million and would change comprehensive income by million 
foreign currency risk we have operations in countries throughout europe  asia and south america 
all foreign operations are measured in their local currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to risk of currency fluctuations throughout europe and asia to the british pound  we have a natural hedge through borrowings in some other currencies 
additionally  we have a natural hedge through borrowings in euros to mitigate a portion of the exposure to risk of currency fluctuations in western europe 
this hedge position is reviewed monthly 
we maintain no derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
our foreign operations reported a loss of million for the year ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to the british pound would change net income for the year by million 
our earnings are also affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of our investments in australia  new zealand and mexico  all of which are accounted for under the equity method 
it is estimated that the result of a fluctuation in the value of the dollar relative to these foreign currencies at december  would change our net income by million 
this analysis does not consider the implications that such fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the us or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities
