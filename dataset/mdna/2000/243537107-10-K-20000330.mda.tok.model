domestically  the company expects lower sales to retailers in the athletic footwear channels as a result of apparent weakness in this segment of the market 
the company expects this decrease to be offset by continued expansion in its international markets  particularly in europe and asia  and through its greatly expanded fall product offering of closed footwear

the year issue results from computer hardware or software programs written using two digits to identify the year 
these computer programs and hardware were designed and developed without consideration of the impact of the change in the century 
as a result  without correction  such systems may not be able to properly distinguish between years that begin with a and years that begin with a 
if not corrected  such hardware and software programs could create erroneous information by or at the year  causing the company  or its customers or suppliers  to become unable to process normal business transactions accurately or at all 
the company is not aware of any material year failures which have occurred in its systems or at its key business partners 
while the company believes that it has achieved year compliance  the company s year compliance is still subject to additional risks including the following  among others the company s failure to adequately identify and analyze issues  failure to identify a year system failure within its internal systems or at a key business partner  failure to convert to compliant systems  failure to fully test converted systems  and failure to implement compliant systems  unanticipated issues or delays in any of the phases of the company s strategy  the inability of customers  suppliers and other business partners to identify and communicate any potential year system failures which they experience  and the breakdown of local and global infrastructures resulting from the non compliance of utilities  banking systems  transportation  government and communications systems 
the company s above assessment of the risks associated with year issues is forward looking

seasonality financial results for the outdoor and footwear industries are generally seasonal 
sales of each of the company s different product lines have historically been higher in different seasons with the highest percentage of teva sales occurring in the first and second quarter of each year and the highest percentage of ugg sales occurring in the fourth quarter  while the quarter with the highest percentage of annual sales for simple has varied from year to year 
based on the company s historical experience  the company would expect greater sales in the first and second quarters than in the third and fourth quarters 
the actual results could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences  availability of product  competition  and the company s customers continuing to carry and promote its various product lines  among other risks and uncertainties
