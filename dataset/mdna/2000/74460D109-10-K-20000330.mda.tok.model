item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
forward looking statements when used within this document  the words expects  believes  anticipates  should  estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and in section f of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors  which may cause the actual results and performance of the company to be materially different from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
such factors include the impact of competition from new and existing storage and commercial facilities which could impact rents and occupancy levels at the company s facilities  the company s ability to evaluate  finance  and integrate acquired and developed properties into the company s existing operations  the company s ability to effectively compete in the markets that it does business in  the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national  state  and local laws and regulations including  without limitation  those governing real estate investment trusts  the acceptance by consumers of the pickup and delivery concept  the impact of general economic conditions upon rental rates and occupancy levels at the company s facilities  and the availability of permanent capital at attractive rates 
overview the storage industry is highly fragmented and is composed predominantly of numerous local and regional operators 
competition in the markets in which we operate is significant and is increasing from additional development of storage facilities in many markets which may negatively impact occupancy levels and rental rates at the storage facilities 
however  we believe that we possess several distinguishing characteristics which enable it to compete effectively with other owners and operators 
we are the largest owner and operator of storage facilities in the united states with ownership interests as of december  in  storage facilities containing approximately million net rentable square feet 
all of our facilities are operated under the public storage brand name  which we believe is the most recognized and established name in the storage industry 
located in the major metropolitan markets of states  our storage facilities are geographically diverse  giving us national recognition and prominence 
this concentration establishes us as one of the dominant providers of storage space in each market in which we operate and enables us to use a variety of promotional activities  such as radio advertising as well as targeted discounting and referrals and  to a lesser extent  television advertising  which are generally not economically viable to our competitors 
in addition  we believe that the geographic diversity of the portfolio reduces the impact from regional economic downturns and provides a greater degree of revenue stability 
commencing in early  we began to implement a national telephone reservation system designed to provide added customer service and maximize utilization of available storage space 
customers calling either the company s toll free telephone referral system  store  or a storage facility are directed to the national reservation system 
a representative discusses with the customer space requirements  price and location preferences and also informs the customer of other products and services provided by the company and its subsidiaries 
the national telephone reservation system has enhanced our ability to effectively market storage space and is primarily responsible for the increase in occupancy levels at our facilities since the reservation system was implemented 
in late  we organized public storage pickup and delivery  inc as a separate corporation and a related partnership the corporation and partnership are collectively referred to as pspud to operate a portable self storage business that rents storage containers to customers for storage in central facilities 
the concept of pspud is to provide an alternative to a traditional storage facility 
pspud delivers a storage container s to the customer s location where the customer  at his convenience  packs his goods into the storage container 
pspud will subsequently return to the customer s location to retrieve the storage container s for storage in a central facility 
at december   pspud had facilities in operation 
due to the start up nature of this business  pspud has incurred operating losses during each of the last four fiscal years 
the operating results of pspud have continued to improve significantly 
for the last six months of fiscal  pspud operations broke even based on an earnings before depreciation and amortization or ebitda 
we will continue to focus our growth strategies on i improving the operating performance of our existing traditional self storage properties  ii increasing our ownership of storage facilities through additional investments  iii improving the operating performance of the portable storage business and iv participating in the growth of ps business parks  inc major elements of these strategies are as follows we will continue to focus upon enhancing the operating performance of our existing traditional self storage properties  primarily through increases in revenues achieved through the telephone reservation center and associated marketing efforts 
these increases in revenue levels are expected to result primarily from increases in realized rent per occupied square foot rather than significant increases in occupancy levels 
we will continue to focus on improving the operations of the portable self storage operations 
the company and pspud are developing facilities that combine portable self storage and traditional self storage combination facilities which will replace existing third party leased facilities and reduce third party lease expense 
we believe that combination facilities offer efficiencies and a more effective method to meet customers needs than a stand alone portable self storage facility 
we expect that  upon completion of our combination facility development program  substantially all of the portable self storage facilities will be operated in combination facilities 
we expect to continue our storage facility development program 
over the past two years  the company and certain development joint ventures that it has an interest in opened a total of storage facilities at a cost of approximately million  with  net rentable square feet 
the company and its development joint ventures have a total of projects identified for openings after december  at a total cost of million 
these projects which includes combination facilities are comprised of storage facilities in process total estimated costs upon completion of million and storage facilities identified that have not yet begun construction estimated costs upon completion of approximately million 
generally  the construction period takes nine to months  followed by an to month fill up process 
throughout the fill up period  we experience earnings dilution to the extent of our interest in the developed properties 
we will acquire facilities from third parties when appropriate 
on march   we completed a merger transaction with storage trust realty storage trust  a publicly traded real estate investment trust 
in connection with the merger  we acquired storage properties located in states 
we believe that our national telephone reservation system and marketing organization present an opportunity for increased revenues through higher occupancies of the properties acquired  as well as cost efficiencies through greater critical mass 
results of operations net income and earnings per common share net income for  and was   and  respectively 
net income allocable to common shareholders net income less preferred stock dividends for  and was   and  respectively 
on a diluted basis  net income per common share was per common share based on weighted average shares outstanding of  for  per common share based on weighted average shares outstanding of  for and based on weighted average shares outstanding of  for the increase in net income per share for compared to was principally the result of improved real estate operations and the impact of decreased start up operating losses of the portable self storage business 
the increase in net income in compared to was principally the result of improved real estate operations and the impact of a special dividend paid in described below 
net income allocable to common shareholders and net income per common share for the year ended december  was negatively impacted by a special dividend totaling  paid to the holders of the series cc convertible preferred stock series cc during the first quarter of during the second quarter of  the series cc stock converted into common stock of the company 
accordingly during  all of the  per common share  on a diluted basis of dividends were treated as an allocation of net income to the preferred shareholders in determining the allocation of net income to the common shareholders 
real estate operations self storage operations our self storage operations are by far the largest component of our operations  representing approximately of total revenues generated during at the end of  we had a total of self storage facilities included in our consolidated financial statements 
since that time we have increased the number of self storage facilities by facilities  facilities and facilities 
as a result of significant acquisitions of self storage facilities in each of the past three years  year over year comparisons as presented on the consolidated statements of income with respect to our self storage operations are not meaningful 
to enhance year over year comparisons  the following table summarizes the operating results before depreciation of i the self storage facilities that are reflected in the financial statements for the entire three years ended december  the consistent group and ii all other self storage facilities for which operations were not reflected in the financial statements for the entire three years ended december  the other facilities self storage operations year ended december  year ended december  percentage percentage change change dollar amounts in thousands  except rents per square foot rental income consistent group     other facilities     cost of operations consistent group     other facilities     net operating income consistent group     other facilities     consistent group data gross margin weighted average occupancy realized annual rent per square foot

at end of period consistent group     other facilities     operations with respect to the other facilities include a partial period of operations with respect to facilities that were acquired or disposed of since january   as well as other facilities that were not operated on a stabilized basis throughout this period 
the consistent group of facilities experienced increased revenues in and of and  respectively  as compared to the preceding year 
the increase in revenues in as compared to was caused primarily by a increase in realized accrual based rates  net of discounts rent per occupied square foot  offset by a reduction in average occupancy levels 
these improvements are due principally to the national telephone reservation system which was implemented during  as well as media advertising and promotional activities 
in  the rate of revenue growth over for the consistent group was less than the rate of growth experienced in over this was primarily due to a leveling of occupancy levels in combined with a slower level of growth of realized rent per occupied square foot 
we expect to continue to experience similar growth rates in fiscal as we experienced in cost of operations includes all direct and indirect costs of operating and managing the facilities 
the following table summarizes major operating expenses with respect to the consistent group in thousands payroll expense    property taxes    advertising    telephone reservation center costs    other    increases in advertising cost are principally due to expanded yellow page advertising in telephone directories partially offset by a reduction in television advertising 
total advertising cost was   and  in   and  respectively 
promotional advertising has increased customer call volume into our national reservation system  where  as indicated above  one of our representatives discusses with the customer space requirements  price and location preferences and also informs the customer of other products and services provided by the company and its subsidiaries telephone reservation center costs have increased due to the expansion of our national telephone reservation 
in connection with the national telephone reservation system  the company implements various pricing and promotional discount strategies designed to increase rental activity 
consistent group promotional discounts which are included as a reduction to gross rents to arrive at rental income were  in   in and  in portable self storage operations in august  pspud  a subsidiary of the company  made its initial entry into the portable self storage business through its acquisition of a single facility operator located in irvine  california 
at december   pspud operated facilities in states 
the facilities are located in major markets in which we have significant market presence with respect to our traditional self storage facilities 
due to the start up nature of the business  pspud incurred operating losses totaling approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  summarized as follows portable self storage year ended december  year ended december  dollar dollar change change dollar amounts in thousand rental and other income       cost of operations direct operating costs       marketing and advertising       facility lease expense       total cost of operations       operating loss prior to depreciation and general and administrative expense      depreciation a      general and administrative a 
     operating losses      a amounts reflect that portion of consolidated depreciation and general and administrative expense that is directly attributable to the portable self storage business 
we believe that the quarterly losses from the portable self storage operations peaked during the third quarter of operating losses were approximately  for the third quarter of and have subsequently decreased each quarter through the fourth quarter of where operating losses were approximately  operations before depreciation for the last six months of were approximately breakeven 
the number of portable self storage facilities pspud operated increased from at december  to at december  due to the opening of facilities in the number of facilities decreased to at december   due to the opening of facilities and the closure of several facilities in non strategic markets and the consolidation of several other facilities into existing facilities within the same markets 
the number of facilities decreased further to at december  due to the closure and consolidation of several additional facilities 
rental and other income includes monthly rental charges to customers for storage of the containers and service fees charged for pickup and delivery of containers to customers homes 
the increase in rental and other income from  in to  in is the result of the significant expansion of the business throughout that period of time 
rental income increased to  in compared to  in principally as a result in increases in the number of occupied containers 
we believe that marketing and advertising activities positively impact move in activity 
commencing in the third quarter of  pspud began to advertise the portable self storage product on television in selected markets 
television advertising was curtailed in the second half of advertising and marketing expense decreased to  in from  in primarily due to the curtailment of television advertising in the second half of advertising and marketing expense decreased to  in from  in  due primarily to reductions in television advertising 
substantially all of the facilities have been leased from third parties 
facility lease expense decreased to  in from  in  principally as a result of the reduction in the number of facilities 
facility lease expense increased to  in from  in due to the aforementioned increase in the number of facilities in and we are currently developing combination facilities that combine mini warehouse and portable self storage space in the same location 
we expect that an increasing part of the portable self storage business will be operated from this type of a facility 
to the extent that these developed combination facilities replace existing third party leased space  lease expense should be reduced

on march   a form registration statement was filed with the securities and exchange commission outlining a plan of distribution with respect to the portable storage operations and our truck rental activities 
under this plan  after the reorganization and recapitalization of certain affiliated entities  we will distribute to our common shareholders all of the common stock of an entity that will primarily own the portable storage business and truck rental activities 
there is no current trading market for the stock of this entity 
we will apply to have the entity s common stock quoted on the nasdaq national market 
commercial property operations our commercial property operations principally consist of our investment in psb  an affiliated real estate investment trust  and to a much lesser extent commercial space owned by the company and consolidated entities 
the following table sets forth the historical commercial property amounts included in the financial statements commercial property operations year ended december  year ended december  change change amounts in thousands rental income     cost of operations     net operating income     from the time of psb s formation through march   we consolidated the accounts of psb in our financial statements 
during the second quarter of  our ownership interest in psb was reduced below and  as a result  we no longer had a controlling interest in psb 
accordingly  effective april   we no longer include the accounts of psb in the consolidated financial statements and have accounted for our investment using the equity method 
for all periods after march   the income statement includes our share of income in psb 
further  commercial property operations for the periods after march  reflect only the commercial property operations of facilities owned by us which have both storage and commercial use combined at the same property location 
equity in earnings of real estate entities in addition to our ownership of equity interests in psb  we had general and limited partnership interests in limited partnerships at december  psb and the limited partnerships are collectively referred to as the unconsolidated entities 
due to our limited ownership interest and control of these entities  we do not consolidate the accounts of these entities for financial reporting purposes  and account for such investments using the equity method 
equity in earnings of real estate entities for the year ended december  consists of our pro rata share of the unconsolidated entities based upon our ownership interest for the period 
similar to the company  the unconsolidated entities other than psb generate substantially all of their income from their ownership of storage facilities  which we manage 
in the aggregate  the unconsolidated entities including psb own a total of real estate facilities  of which are storage facilities

the increase in equity in earnings of real estate entities compared to is principally the result of improved operations of psb  as well as the impact of the deconsolidation of psb effective april  whereby s equity in earnings includes a full year with respect to our interest in the operations of psb  and includes nine months of such interest 
the increase is partially offset by the impact of certain business combinations occurring in and whereby we acquired a controlling interest in certain entities and began to include the accounts of such entities in the consolidated financial statements 
prior to the inclusion of these entities in the consolidated financial statements  we used the equity method to report our share of the entities earnings 
the increase in equity in earnings of real estate entities compared to is principally the result of the deconsolidation of psb as described above 
this increase is partially offset by the impact of certain business combinations occurring in and whereby we acquired a controlling interest in certain entities and began to include the accounts of such entities in the consolidated financial statements 
prior to the inclusion of these entities in the consolidated financial statements  we used the equity method to report our share of the entities earnings 
psb is a publicly traded real estate investment trust organized by the company on january  during  the company and certain partnerships in which the company has a controlling interest contributed substantially all of their commercial properties to psb in exchange for equity interests 
at december   psb owned properties located in states 
psb also manages the commercial properties owned by the company and affiliated entities 
as of december   the company and certain partnerships in which the company has a controlling interest owned approximately of the common equity interest of psb 
in april  we formed a joint venture partnership the development joint venture with an institutional investor to participate in the development of approximately million of storage facilities 
the venture is funded solely with equity capital consisting of from the company and from the institutional investor 
equity in earnings from the development joint venture reflects our pro rata share  based upon our ownership interest  of the operations of the development joint venture 
since inception through december   the development joint venture has developed and opened storage facilities approximately  square feet and at december  had three facilities under development approximately  square feet 
generally the construction period takes nine to months followed by a to month fill up process until the newly constructed facility reaches a stabilized occupancy level of approximately 
for fiscal   and  the majority of the completed facilities are in the fill up process and had not reached a stabilized occupancy level 
we expect that our earnings with respect to our investment in the development joint venture will continue to increase in as compared to as the existing properties continue to fill up 
other income and expense items interest and other income the net operating results from our property management operations and merchandise sales are presented along with interest and other income  as interest and other income 
the components of interest and other income are detailed as follows year ended december  year ended december  change change amounts in thousands facility management revenues      cost of operations    net operating income      sales of packaging material and truck rental income revenues       cost of operations       net operating income      interest and other income       total interest and other income       facility management operations are primarily attributable to management of self storage properties 
at december   we managed storage facilities owned by unconsolidated entities and owned by third parties pursuant to property management contracts 
the property management contracts generally provide for compensation equal to of gross revenues of the facilities managed 
under the supervision of the property owners  we coordinate rental policies  rent collections  marketing activities  the purchase of equipment and supplies  maintenance activity  and the selection and engagement of vendors  suppliers and independent contractors 
in addition  we assist and advise the property owners in establishing policies for the hire  discharge and supervision of employees for the operation of these facilities  including resident managers  assistant managers  relief managers and billing and maintenance personnel 
throughout the three year period ended december   we completed several acquisitions of storage facilities from affiliated entities and  as a result  storage properties which were managed by us became owned facilities and the related management fee income with respect to these facilities ceased 
accordingly  property management operations with respect to storage facilities have continuously decreased during the three year period ended december  since we have acquired in the past  and may continue to seek to acquire in the future  real estate facilities owned by the unconsolidated entities  our facility management income may decrease in compared to sales of packaging material and truck rentals have increased as a result of our retail expansion program described below 
the strategic objective of the retail expansion program is to create a retail store that will i rent spaces for the attached storage facility  ii rent spaces for the other public storage facilities in adjacent neighborhoods  iii sell locks  boxes and packing materials to the general public  including tenants and iv rent trucks and other moving equipment  all in an environment that is more retail oriented 
retail stores have been retrofitted to existing storage facility rental offices or built in as part of the development of new storage facilities  both in high traffic  high visibility locations 
the increases in revenues and cost of operations reflect the opening of additional stores  as well as increases at our existing stores 
interest and other income is primarily attributable to interest income on cash balances and interest income from mortgage notes receivable 
interest income from mortgage notes receivable was   and  in  and  respectively 
the changes in interest income from mortgage notes receivable reflect the changes in mortgage notes receivable balances 
fluctuations in the level of invested cash balances  caused by the timing of investing equity offering proceeds in real estate assets  led to a decrease in interest income in as compared to  and led to an increase in interest income in as compared to depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was  in   in and  in depreciation expense with respect to the real estate facilities was  in   in and  in  the increases are due to the acquisition of additional real estate facilities in through depreciation expense with respect to non real estate assets  primarily depreciation of equipment associated with the portable self storage operations  was  in   in  and  in  the increases are due to the expansion in the portable self storage operations 
amortization expense with respect to intangible assets totaled  for each of the three years ended december  general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was  in   in and  in general and administrative costs for each year principally consist of state income taxes for states in which the company is a non resident  investor relation expenses  certain overhead associated with the acquisition and development of real estate facilities  and certain overhead associated with the portable self storage business 
included in general and administrative expense for   and is approximately   and  respectively  with respect to our portable self storage business  amounts incurred in and include significant amounts related to recruiting and training personnel  equipment  computer software and professional fees in organizing the portable self storage business 
prior to the impact of the portable self storage business  we experienced and expect to continue to experience increased general and administrative costs due to the following i the growth in the size of the company  and ii the company s property acquisition and development activities have continued to expand  resulting in certain additional costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of additional real estate facilities 
general and administrative costs for each year principally consist of state income taxes for states in which the company is a non resident  investor relation expenses  certain overhead associated with the acquisition and development of real estate facilities 
interest expense interest expense was  in   in and  in debt and related interest expense remain relatively low compared to our overall asset base 
capitalized interest expense totaled  in   in and  in in connection with our development activities 
interest expense before the capitalization of interest was  in   in and  in the decrease in interest expense in as compared to principally is due to the retirement of debt in of approximately  the increase in interest expense in as compared to is due to the million of notes payable assumed in the merger with storage trust 
minority interest in income minority interest in income represents the income allocable to equity interests in consolidated entities  which are not owned by the company 
since  we have acquired portions of these equity interests through our acquisition of limited and general partnership interests in the consolidated entities 
these acquisitions have resulted in reductions to the minority interest in income from what it would otherwise have been in the absence of such acquisitions  and accordingly  have increased our share of the consolidated entities income 
during   and  we acquired sufficient ownership interest and control in thirteen  three  and twelve partnerships  respectively  and commenced including the accounts of these partnerships in the consolidated financial statements  resulting in an increase in minority interest in income 
the increase in minority interest in income in compared to is primarily related to the minority interest in psb prior to april  the decrease in minority interest in income in as compared to is the result of the deconsolidation of psb  partially offset by the consolidation of additional partnerships 
in determining income allocable to the minority interest for  and consolidated depreciation and amortization expense of approximately   and  respectively  was allocated to the minority interest 
the changes in depreciation allocated to the minority interest were principally the result of the factors denoted above with respect to minority interest in income 
supplemental property data and trends at december   there were approximately ownership entities owning in aggregate  storage facilities  including the facilities which we own and or operate 
at december   of these facilities were owned by unconsolidated entities  entities in which we has an ownership interest and use the equity method for financial statement presentation 
the remaining  facilities are owned by the company and consolidated entities  of which facilities were acquired in the merger with storage trust in the following table summarizes our investment in real estate facilities as of december  number of facilities in which the net rentable square footage company has an ownership interest in thousands storage commercial storage commercial facilities properties total facilities properties total wholly owned facilities   facilities owned by consolidated entities   total consolidated facilities     facilities owned by unconsolidated entities    total facilities in which the company has an ownership interest      in order to evaluate how our overall portfolio has performed  we analyze the operating performance of a consistent group of storage facilities representing million net rentable square feet of the  storage facilities herein referred to as same store storage facilities 
the facilities represent a consistent pool of properties which have been operated under the public storage name  at a stabilized level  by the company since january  from time to time  we remove facilities from the same store pool as a result of expansions  dispositions or other activities which make such facilities results not comparable to previous periods 
the same store group of properties includes facilities that are not consolidated in the financial statements 
accordingly  rental income and cost of operations with respect to these facilities are not reflected on the consolidated statements of income 
as of december   the remaining facilities are included in the consolidated financial statements  however  many of them were not included in the consolidated financial statements throughout each of the three years presented

the gross profit margin excluding the facility management fee was  and in  and  respectively 
realized rent per square foot as presented throughout this report represents the actual revenue earned per occupied square foot 
management believes this is a more relevant measure than the scheduled rental rates  since scheduled rates can be discounted through the use of promotions 
in early  we implemented a national telephone reservation system designed to provide added customer service for all the storage facilities under management 
we believe that the improved operating results  as indicated in the above table  in large part are due to the success of the national telephone reservation system 
in  the rate of revenue growth over for the same store facilities was less than the rate of growth experienced in over this was primarily due to a leveling of occupancy levels in combined with a slower level of growth of realized rent per occupied square foot 
we expect to continue to experience similar growth rates in fiscal as we experienced in rental income for the same store facilities included promotional discounts totaling  in compared to  in and  in during there was experimentation with pricing and promotional discounts designed to increase rental activity  such promotional activities continued in the storage facilities experience minor seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancies generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months 
the company believes that these fluctuations result in part from increased moving activities during the summer

number of facilities liquidity and capital resources we believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable it to meet our operating expenses  capital improvements  debt service requirements and distributions to shareholders for the foreseeable future 
operating as a real estate investment trust reit  our ability to retain cash flow for reinvestment is restricted 
in order for us to maintain our reit status  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to make distributions to our shareholders see reit status below 
however  despite the significant distribution requirements  we have been able to retain a significant amount of our operating cash flow 
the following table summarizes our ability to make the minority interests distributions  dividend payments to the preferred shareholders and capital improvements to maintain the facilities through the use of cash provided by operating activities

we intend to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facility from undistributed operating cash flow or  as market conditions permit and are determined to be advantageous  from the public or private placement of equity securities 
we believe that our size and financial flexibility enables us to access capital for growth when appropriate 
our financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt to total capitalization  increasing net income  increasing cash flow from operations  and a conservative dividend payout ratio with respect to the common stock 
our credit ratings on our senior preferred stock by each of the three major credit agencies are baa by moody s and bbb by standard and poor s and duff phelps 
our portfolio of real estate facilities remains substantially unencumbered 
at december   the company had mortgage debt outstanding of million and had consolidated real estate facilities with a book value of billion 
we generally only increased our debt in connection with the acquisition of real estate facilities 
over the past three years we have funded substantially all of our acquisitions with permanent capital both common and preferred stock 
we have elected to use preferred stock despite the fact that the dividend rates of our preferred stock exceeds current interest rates on conventional debt 
we have chosen this method of financing for the following reasons i our perpetual preferred stock has no sinking fund requirement  or maturity date and does not require redemption  all of which eliminate any future refinancing risks  ii preferred stock allows us to leverage the common stock without the attendant interest rate or refinancing risks of debt  and iii like interest payments  dividends on the preferred stock can be applied to our reit distributions requirements  which have helped us to maintain a low common stock dividend payout ratio and retain cash flow 
despite difficult capital markets  we were able to publicly issue million of preferred stock during in addition  on march   we issued million of our series n cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units in one of our operating partnerships in a private placement 
further  on march   we issued million of our series o cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units in one of our operating partnerships in a private placement 
under certain conditions  the preferred partnership units are convertible into preferred stock of the company 
like many other reit s  we are both unwilling and unable to issue shares of our common stock publicly under the current market conditions 
concurrent with the special distribution  discussed below  we publicly issued  equity stock  series a  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds were used  in part  to pay for the cash elections of the special distribution 
distribution requirements our conservative distribution policy has been the principal reason for the company s ability to retain significant operating cash flows which have been used to make additional investments and reduce debt 
during  and  we paid regular cash distributions to common shareholders of approximately  and of our cash available from operations allocable to common shareholders  respectively 
for  when factoring in the total special distribution  we distributed approximately of our cash available from operations allocable to common shareholders 
on november   the board of directors declared a special distribution payable on january  to common shareholders of record on november  at the election of each shareholder  the distribution was payable in either per share in depositary shares  each representing  of a share of equity stock  series a or per share in cash 
on january   approximately million was paid in cash and million of depositary shares were issued to our common shareholders in connection with this special distribution 
during  we paid dividends totaling  to the holders of our senior preferred stock   in regular distributions to the holders of common stock and a special cash distribution to the holders of common stock totaling  that was accrued but not paid at december  we estimate that the distribution requirements for fiscal with respect to senior preferred stock outstanding at december  to be approximately million 
with respect to the preferred operating partnership units issued on march   the company estimates the annual distribution requirement to be approximately million 
distributions with respect to the common stock and equity stock  series a will be determined based upon our reit distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders 
with respect to the depositary shares of equity stock  series a  we have no obligation to pay distributions if no distributions are paid to the common shareholders 
to the extent that we do pay common distributions in any year  the holders of the depositary shares receive the lesser of i five times the per share dividend on the common stock or ii 
the depositary shares are noncumulative  and have no preference over our common stock either as to dividends or in liquidation 
assuming that we pay at least in common dividends in any year  we will pay a total of million in distributions to the holders of the  shares of equity stock  series a during including the special distribution declared on november   we distributed a total of approximately million to common shareholders  or approximately per common share  in assuming a continuation of increasing level of taxable income  we expect that we will have similar distribution requirements in the year capital improvement requirements during  we have budgeted approximately million for capital improvements 
the minority interests share of the budgeted capital improvements is approximately million 
debt service requirements we do not believe we have any significant refinancing risks with respect to our mortgage debt  all of which is fixed rate 
at december   we had total outstanding notes payable of approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for approximate principal maturities of such borrowings 
in connection with the march merger with storage trust  we assumed million of notes payable 
approximately million  million and million in principal payments with respect to these notes are due in  and  respectively  with the remainder due after growth strategies during  we intend to continue to expand our asset and capital base principally through the acquisition of real estate assets and interests in real estate assets from both unaffiliated and affiliated parties through direct purchases  mergers  tender offers or other transactions and through the development of additional storage facilities 
in addition to wholly owned storage facilities  we operate  on behalf of approximately ownership entities  storage facilities under the public storage name in which we have a partial equity interest 
from time to time  some of these storage facilities or interests in them are available for purchase  providing us with a source of additional acquisition opportunities 
merger with storage trust on march   the company and storage trust  a public reit  completed a merger 
as a result of the merger  we acquired storage facilities located in states totaling approximately million net rentable square feet and  units 
in connection with the merger  we issued shares of the company s common stock for each share of storage trust common stock 
this exchange ratio implied an enterprise value for storage trust of approximately million  including the assumption of approximately million of indebtedness including million of borrowings on storage trust s line of credit 
we immediately repaid the million of borrowings on the line of credit 
development of storage facilities since  the company  principally through its affiliated development joint ventures  has opened a total of facilities  one in  four in  nine in  in  and in in april  we formed our first development joint venture for the purpose of developing approximately million of storage facilities 
since inception through december   this joint venture has developed and opened storage facilities with a total cost of approximately million 
at december   the joint venture had facilities under development approximately  square feet with an aggregate cost incurred to date of approximately million and estimated remaining costs to complete of million 
in november  we formed a second joint venture partnership to participate in the development of approximately million of storage facilities and to purchase million of the company s equity stock  series aaa 
this development joint venture is consolidated on the consolidated financial statements  and therefore the equity stock  series aaa is eliminated in consolidation 
the joint venture is funded solely with equity capital consisting of from the company and from the joint venture partner 
upon formation of the joint venture through december   we have received proceeds of approximately million  composed of the investors share of the purchase of the company s equity stock  series aaa million and million composed of the joint venture partner s pro rata share of development costs of projects in the venture 
the second joint venture has completed three facilities with an aggregate cost of approximately million  and has three projects in process with total costs incurred of million and costs to complete of million 
additional projects will be submitted to the joint venture for the total contemplated development amount of million 
assuming projects are approved and developed by the venture equal to the million contemplated development amount  the investors remaining contribution at december  is approximately million  or of the remaining development costs 
excluding the six facilities in process by the development joint ventures  we are developing additional storage facilities  with total incurred costs at december  of million and total costs to complete of million 
we have also identified storage facilities for development  with total estimated costs of million 
these projects are subject to significant contingencies 
we expect to finance our development through a combination of retained cash flows  remaining proceeds from our joint venture partners  and the net proceeds received through the issuance of preferred partnership units as discussed above 
reit status we believe that we have operated  and intend to continue to operate  in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify 
to the extent that the company continues to qualify as a reit  we will not be taxed  with certain limited exceptions  on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders  provided that at least of our taxable income is so distributed prior to filing of the company s tax return 
we have satisfied the reit distribution requirement since funds from operations total funds from operations or ffo increased to million for the year ended compared to million for the year ended and million in ffo available to common shareholders after deducting preferred stock dividends increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in and million in ffo means net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles before i gain loss on early extinguishment of debt  ii minority interest in income and iii gain loss on disposition of real estate  adjusted as follows i plus depreciation and amortization including the company s pro rata share of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated equity interests and amortization of assets acquired in a merger  including property management agreements and goodwill  and ii less ffo attributable to minority interests 
ffo is a supplemental performance measure for equity reits as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
the nareit definition does not specifically address the treatment of minority interest in the determination of ffo or the treatment of the amortization of property management agreements and goodwill 
in the case of the company  ffo represents amounts attributable to its shareholders after deducting amounts attributable to the minority interests and before deductions for the amortization of property management agreements and goodwill 
ffo is presented because management  as well as many industry analysts  consider ffo to be one measure of the performance of the company and it is used in establishing the terms of the class b common stock 
ffo does not take into consideration capital improvements  scheduled principal payments on debt  distributions and other obligations of the company 
accordingly  ffo is not a substitute for the company s cash flow or net income as discussed above as a measure of the company s liquidity or operating performance 
ffo is not comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other reits that do not define it exactly as we have defined it 
impact of the year the yk issue arises because many computerized systems use two digits rather than four to identify a year 
any of our computer programs or hardware with the yk issue that have date sensitive applications or embedded chips could recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the same issue has been faced by our outside vendors  including those vendors in the banking and payroll processing areas 
any failure in these areas could result in disruptions of operations 
as a result of our assessment and remediation activities conducted in recent years  we experienced no significant disruptions in our operations  and believe that our information systems responded successfully to the yk date change 
at this time  we are not aware of any material problems that resulted from the yk date change at any of our outside vendors  including those vendors in the banking and payroll processing areas 
we will continue to monitor our information systems and those of our outside vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent yk issues that may arise are addressed promptly 
the cost of the company s year compliance activities  substantially all of which have been incurred through december   is estimated at approximately million 
these costs are capitalized 
there can be no assurance that we have identified all potential yk issues either within our information systems  at our outside vendors  or at external agents 
in addition  the impact of any unresolved or unidentified yk issues on governmental entities and utility providers and the resultant impact upon the company  as well as disruptions in the general economy  may be material but cannot be reasonably determined or quantified
