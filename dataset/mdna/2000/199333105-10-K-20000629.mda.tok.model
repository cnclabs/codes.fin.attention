the lower spending in fiscal reflects a deferral of certain projects due to soft market conditions 
inflation and other market conditions the company s costs are affected by inflation in the us economy  and to a lesser extent  in foreign economies including those of europe  canada  mexico  and the pacific rim 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on results of operations over the periods presented because of low inflation levels over the periods and because the company has generally been able to pass on rising costs through price increases 
however  in the future there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation or that it will be able to pass on cost increases 
seasonality and quarterly results quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  by periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations  and by acquisitions and the magnitude of acquisition costs 
therefore  the operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
the company is exposed to various market risks  including commodity prices for raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates  and primarily changes in interest rates 
the company has entered into financial instrument transactions which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company s primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel 
the company controls this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of its products 
the company does not enter into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs 
approximately of the company s sales are from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions 
the company manufactures its products in the united states  canada  germany  denmark  the united kingdom  mexico  france and china and sells its products and solutions in over countries annually 
the company s results of operations could be affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the company s operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  european currencies  the mexican peso and the chinese renminbi 
for example  when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  the value of sales and net income denominated in canadian dollars decreases when translated into us dollars for inclusion in the company s consolidated results 
the company also is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of foreign operations sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency 
in addition  the majority of export sale transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  the company currently does not invest in derivative instruments such as foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions 
the company controls risk related to changes in interest rates through structuring its debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by periodically entering into financial instrument transactions 
at march   approximately of the company s outstanding debt has fixed interest rates 
at that date  the company has approximately million of variable rate non current debt and has an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million maturing in july based on libor at  plus the applicable margin based on the company s leverage ratio 
under this agreement  the company makes or receives payments equal to the difference between fixed and variable interest rate payments on the notional amount 
a fluctuation in interest rates would change future interest expense on the million of debt that is not covered by the swap agreement by approximately million
