item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation forward looking statements this annual report on form k forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves so long as they identify these statements as forward looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ from the projected results 
all statements other than statements of historical fact made in this annual report on form k are forward looking 
in particular  the statements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements reflect management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain 
rowecom s actual results may differ significantly from management s expectations 
the following discussion and the section entitled business additional factors that may affect future results describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause these differences 
overview of rowecom s operations and financial performance rowecom provides businesses and their employees with an e commerce solution for purchasing and managing the acquisition of magazines  newspapers  journals  e journals  books and other knowledge resources through a corporate intranet or the internet 
we offer our clients access to the largest catalog of magazines  newspapers  journals  e journals  books and other knowledge resources on the internet 
rowecom allows employees to purchase knowledge resources easily and conveniently from their desktop computers and provides businesses with a highly effective means of managing and controlling purchases of knowledge resources and reducing costs 
our target clients are in knowledge intense industries  such as business and financial services  biomedical  academic and the federal government  and corporate and financial services 
rowecom began significant commercial operations in march we introduced our flagship product  the kstore  in june since its inception  rowecom has incurred significant net losses and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
substantially all of our revenues are generated by the sale of magazines  newspapers  journals  e journals  books and other knowledge resources published by third parties 
the sales price of each knowledge resource reflects the cost to rowecom of the knowledge resource plus the fee retained by rowecom 
prior to the fourth quarter of  rowecom only charged a fixed transaction fee 
rowecom currently receives either a flat fee or the difference between the price paid by the client and the publisher s discount price paid by rowecom for the knowledge resource  or a combination of the two 
the amount of these discounts varies by transaction and client 
clients can pay by several secure payment options including direct debit  procurement card and credit card 
rowecom  in some cases  finances the knowledge resource purchases of its clients and at december  had outstanding accounts receivable of million 
rowecom s services initially focused on academic libraries and centralized purchasing groups 
beginning in  we have increasingly focused our sales and marketing efforts on corporate clients and on desktop purchases by individuals rather than centralized purchasing groups 
we believe that an increase in the number of desktop purchasers at a client would increase the amount of revenue generated by such client 
to date  a substantial majority of our revenues have been generated in the fourth quarter of each year  primarily because most subscriptions are purchased or renewed in that quarter  with subscriptions generally beginning on january st 
as purchases by individual employees increase as a percentage of total revenues  the seasonality described above has begun to decrease because desktop purchases are generally made as required  and thus are more evenly distributed throughout the year 
dawson subscription business  which was acquired by rowecom in october by the purchase of certain assets of uk based dawson information services and all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of dawson  inc  has experienced similar seasonality 
for a more detailed discussion of the seasonality of our business  see selected quarterly results of operations  and acquisition of dawson 
substantially all of rowecom s expenses consist of the cost of the knowledge resources sold to its clients  which are variable  and sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses  which are relatively fixed 
rowecom s fixed expense levels have increased over time as its operations have expanded and are expected to continue to increase over the near and medium term 
management expects that expenses will increase primarily in sales and marketing as rowecom increases its direct sales force and support staff  and in research and development  as rowecom develops new technology to enhance its service 
sales and operating results generally depend on the volume and timing of orders received  which are difficult to forecast 
as a result  rowecom may be unable to adjust fixed expense spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected fluctuation or shortfall in revenue or gross profit 
any significant shortfall in gross profit in relation to rowecom s fixed expenses would have an immediate adverse effect on rowecom s results of operations 
in the third and fourth quarters of  rowecom entered into strategic alliances with barnesandnoble 
com inc 
and newsub services  inc  each of which added substantial new content to our catalog as well as new distribution channels for our services 
barnesandnoble 
com will pay rowecom a fixed percentage of the purchase price of every book sold either through rowecom s kstore or barnesandnoble 
com s business solutions service  other than sales to existing clients of the business solutions service as of the date of the agreement 
rowecom will pay barnesandnoble 
com a fixed amount or percentage of the purchase price of every subscription sold by rowecom s kstore or barnesandnoble 
com s business solutions service  other than sales to existing rowecom customers as of the date of the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement with newsub services  each party will earn revenue on titles sold through the other party s online distribution channel by receiving a percentage of the gross sales price or a transaction fee for each of its respective titles sold by the other party 
these strategic alliances are not expected to generate material revenues  if any  until the second half of rowecom has entered into other strategic relationships and intends to continue to enter into strategic relationships that will further increase content and add new distribution channels 
rowecom expects that the terms of most strategic alliances will include some element of revenue sharing between the parties 
see business strategic alliances 
in june  rowecom acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of corporate subscription services  inc for  in cash  subject to certain post closing adjustments  and  shares of rowecom s common stock  which were valued at approximately  in august  rowecom acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of international subscription agencies pty 
ltd 
for  in cash 
acquisition of dawson on october   pursuant to the terms of a purchase and sale agreement  dated as of september   between rowecom  dawson holdings plc and certain other dawson affiliated entities  rowecom acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of dawson  inc  a delaware corporation  and certain assets of united kingdom based dawson information services group relating to subscription services  a state of the art  web based information searching and retrieval tool  and library information management software and services 
the acquired dawson group includes over  clients  employees and operations in nine locations folkestone  uk  paris  france  madrid  spain  london  ontario  montreal  quebec  westwood  massachusetts  oregon  illinois  chantilly  virginia  and carlsbad  california 
rowecom paid net consideration of million in cash and issued approximately  shares of rowecom s common stock  which were valued at million  and paid acquisition costs of million  as part of an aggregate net consideration of approximately million 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  rowecom is obligated to issue an additional l million of rowecom common stock  at a price per share of approximately  as part of the purchase price for the acquisition  after making an adjustment based upon profit calculations for the period from the completion of the acquisition to december  rowecom expects to issue these shares in the first half of we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in revenues because substantially all of our revenues have been generated in the fourth quarter of each year when most subscriptions are purchased or renewed by our clients 
as a result of the seasonal nature of our cash flows  we will have to rely to a greater extent on bank financing and lines of credit and other sources of liquidity to cover current operating expenses during such periods 
rowecom s gross margin 
rowecom s gross margin has increased in each of the past three years from in to for the year ended december  the gross margin reflects the mix of products purchased by our clients  the discount rates we are able to obtain from publishers  our pricing structure  and the amount of installation fees we earn as a proportion of total revenues 
we are seeking to increase rowecom s gross margin by reassessing our pricing structure from time to time to take advantage of favorable market conditions  increasing sales of higher margin products  and obtaining greater discounts from publishers 
we believe that the combined effect of these strategies  which are discussed in greater detail below  will improve our gross margin 
the companies acquired by rowecom have historically shown higher gross margins than rowecom 
rowecom expects that it will begin to realize the full effect of the improved margins during however  we cannot be certain that these strategies will be successful or of the timing or extent of any improvement 
pricing 
rowecom generally purchases publications from publishers at a discount from the list price 
these discounts vary widely from an average of on high priced scientific  technical and medical publications  whose average selling price is hundreds of dollars  to for lower priced general interest and large circulation magazines  whose average selling price is below until the fourth quarter of  rowecom s pricing strategy had been to pass the discount provided by the publisher on to the buyer and retain only a flat fee for each subscription sold 
this aggressive pricing strategy was aimed at gaining market share quickly and establishing the rowecom brand  but led to low gross margins 
in the fourth quarter of  rowecom began offering approximately large circulation and general interest publications under its alliance with newsub services 
rowecom earns a margin on initial orders and a margin on renewals of these publications 
rowecom plans to aggressively promote these publications in in order to seek to improve gross margin overall 
in the first quarter of  rowecom began retaining a portion of the discounts it obtains from publishers on serials instead of passing such discounts on to customers  as it had done in the past 
nonetheless  rowecom offers its large volume customers the guaranteed lowest price on the market for all subscriptions 
rowecom expects that this change in pricing will benefit rowecom s gross margin  although no assurances can be given that this strategy will be successful 
product mix 
rowecom believes that its increased focus on corporate desktop purchases will result in increased sales of lower priced items on which rowecom retains a higher percentage of the sales price 
corporate libraries and central purchasing groups generally purchase higher priced business and trade  scientific  technical and medical publications  while desktop purchases tend to be lower priced business and trade  and general interest and large circulation publications 
rowecom s kstore is specifically designed to allow decentralized desktop purchases with centralized approval and reporting 
this feature  combined with favorable pricing on lower priced items and books  should increase sales of lower priced knowledge resources 
our increased focus on desktop sales may result in higher gross margins  but there can be no assurance that rowecom s trend of increasing desktop purchases will continue or that  if continued  the trend will produce increased gross margin 
greater discounts 
we believe that the increasing volume of sales by rowecom will increase the buying power of rowecom and possibly allow us to negotiate higher discounts from publishers on the items we resell 
this will provide the opportunity for higher gross margins and improved pricing 
we cannot be certain  however  that our sales volumes will continue to increase or that we will be able to obtain greater discounts  or that any such changes will have a positive effect on rowecom s gross margin 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  were million  as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase resulted primarily from increased sales per client and growth in our client base  particularly related to the acquisition of dawson 
transaction volumes for the year ended december  also increased significantly by  from the year ended december  from  to million transactions  primarily due to volume increases related to the dawson acquisition 
the average selling price per transaction for the year ended december  was as compared to during the year ended december  cost of revenues 
cost of revenues in the year ended december  was million as compared to million during the year ended december   an increase of million or 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues decreased to during the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  this improvement was primarily due to the clients added by the dawson acquisition 
installation revenue was  during the year ended december  and  during the year ended december  sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million during the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this growth is primarily due to an increase of personnel and the associated expenses of recruiting  hiring  and training the additional personnel 
personnel expenses increased to approximately million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  in addition  during the year ended december   rowecom incurred approximately million in advertising costs  which included the announcement of the dawson acquisition 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of million or  primarily as a result of increased staffing and associated costs incurred in an effort to integrate new content into our catalog  to enhance the user interface and functionality of the kstore  and to develop the transaction processing systems 
consulting fees in connection with these improvements increased to  during the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase can be primarily attributed to growth in average headcount in the administrative  finance and human resources departments 
rowecom has also incurred certain additional costs in its operation as a newly public company  including insurance  investor relations and accounting fees that resulted in an overall increase in expenses of  for the year ended december  stock based compensation 
stock based compensation was  in the year ended december  under an agreement among certain of rowecom s shareholders  working ventures canadian fund  inc was required to transfer an aggregate of  shares of common stock to rowecom for transfer to certain other shareholders and option holders of rowecom if working ventures initial investment increased by or more  on an annually compounded basis  and it is not legally restricted from selling these shares 
as a result of the expiration of the initial public offering s lock up period on september   these conditions were satisfied and rowecom was required to record a compensation charge equal to the aggregate fair market value of the common stock transferred by working ventures and eventually received by rowecom option and warrant holders who are eligible to receive such shares as described above 
goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization was million in the year ended december  as a result of the acquisitions of corporate subscription services  inc and international subscription agencies pty 
ltd  approximately million in goodwill was recorded and is being amortized over a thirty six month period from the date of the acquisitions

this was partially offset by a increase in accounts payable 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a net loss of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared to  for the year ended december  cash used for the acquisitions of corporate subscription services  inc  international subscription agencies pty 
ltd  and dawson s subscription business net of cash acquired  was million for the year ended december  substantially all cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was for the purchase of equipment and furnishings 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  proceeds from the initial public offering  net of underwriting discounts and offering costs  were million  proceeds from loans were million  and proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt  net of offering costs  was million 
during the year ended december   million in cash provided by financing activities was from the sale of  shares of class b redeemable convertible preferred stock and  shares of class c redeemable convertible preferred stock 
prior to the initial public offering  rowecom financed its operations primarily through sales of its equity securities in private placements 
at december   rowecom had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million  debt of million and stockholders equity of million 
rowecom has historically funded its operations through sales of its preferred stock  our initial public offering and limited borrowings from third party financing sources 
during  rowecom entered into additional financing arrangements including the sale of convertible promissory notes and domestic and foreign credit facilities  and expects to meet its short and medium term liquidity requirements through borrowings under these arrangements and use of its existing cash balances 
rowecom currently believes that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to enable rowecom to meet anticipated cash requirements through at least rowecom may also gain additional liquidity through the use of cash balances of companies that it may acquire and  possibly  additional debt or equity financings 
however  rowecom cannot assure you that additional capital beyond the amounts currently forecasted by rowecom will not be required nor that any required additional capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at the time it may be required 
sale of convertible notes and common stock purchase warrants 
on october   rowecom entered into a securities purchase agreement with two investors under which rowecom issued and sold notes convertible into rowecom common stock in the aggregate principal amount of million and warrants to purchase up to  shares of rowecom s common stock at an exercise price of approximately per share 
the sale of the convertible notes and the warrants generated net proceeds of approximately million for rowecom 
the notes are convertible into shares of rowecom s common stock on the terms and conditions set forth in the securities purchase agreement and the notes pursuant to calculations based upon the outstanding principal amount plus interest and the trading price of rowecom common stock  provided that the notes may not be converted into rowecom common stock until january   at the earliest  unless specified conditions occur causing an acceleration 
rowecom also has an option  subject to certain conditions  to require the investors to invest up to an additional million in additional convertible notes and warrants 
this option is not presently exercisable and may not become exercisable 
rowecom also granted the investors certain rights to require the registration under applicable securities laws of the shares of rowecom common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes and exercise of the warrants 
revolving lines of credit 
in october  rowecom uk ltd  our wholly owned united kingdom subsidiary entered into a revolving line of credit for up to l with national westminster bank plc 
the line of credit is secured by a the grant of a security interest in rowecom uk ltd 
s accounts receivable 
in addition  we have guaranteed the loan  up to an aggregate of approximately l the line of credit will be available to the borrower until april  and bear interest at the rate of the bank s base rate  plus 
in october  rowecom france sarl entered into a credit agreement with credit du nord for an initial million french franc line of credit that will be reduced on february  to a million french franc line of credit 
the line of credit will be available from december  to may  and bears interest at the rate of euribor plus 
the facility has been guaranteed by rowecom  and rowecom has agreed to maintain ownership of rowecom france sarl at all times while any amounts are outstanding under the facility  which terminates december   unless renewed 
on november   rowecom france sarl  a wholly owned subsidiary of rowecom  entered into a credit facility with barclays bank plc that permits a maximum borrowing of million french francs  limited to million francs per transaction 
the line of credit is for unlimited duration and bears interest at the rate of the average monthly financial market rate plus 
the line of credit also provides for a million french franc daily overdraft that is available from november to may each year  and bears interest at the rate of euribor plus 
in december  rowecom france sarl established a line of credit with banque nationale de paris for million french francs 
borrowing under the facility is limited to of rowecom france s accounts receivable  and accrues interest at the rate of euribor plus 
the line of credit will be reduced to million french francs after april  and will expire on june  on december   three wholly owned subsidiaries of rowecom s wholly owned subsidiary dawson  inc  entered into a revolving line of credit with a financial institution in the aggregate amount of million 
the line of credit is secured by a lien on all of the assets  accounts receivable and after acquired property of the three subsidiaries of dawson 
in addition  rowecom and dawson have signed unconditional guaranties of full payment of the loan made to the three subsidiaries 
the entire unpaid principal balance of the loan becomes due may   with interest payments due on the last business day of each month 
the revolving line of credit is scheduled to terminate on november   but under some conditions may be extended for an additional day period 
the borrowings of the subsidiaries under the revolving credit loans bear interest at the lender s prime rate 
if its subsidiaries default on these loans  rowecom may ultimately have to pay any unpaid balances on the line of credit 
as of december   the aggregate amount borrowed under the line of credit was million 
impact of year issue on operations and financial condition of rowecom as many computer systems and other equipment with imbedded control chips or microprocessors use only two digits to represent the year  they may be unable to process accurately certain data before  during or after the year to the extent that a business system does not fail or make miscalculations as a result of the year date change  such a system is described as being year compliant 
while rowecom believes that it has been taking adequate steps to make sure that its business systems are year compliant  and did not incur material costs in preparing for the year date change  achieving complete year compliance is subject to various risks and uncertainties  and there can be no assurance that the year date change will not lead to failures of such systems that may have a material adverse effect on rowecom s future results of operations and financial condition 
rowecom has been aware of the possible impact of year issues on its operations since inception and has focused on making its business systems year compliant since that time 
most of this effort has been focused upon business systems owned or operated by rowecom or third parties  the failure of which would directly and adversely affect rowecom s ability to provide its services or would otherwise affect revenues or reliability for such a period of time as to lead to unrecoverable consequences 
during  approximately two employees of rowecom were working either on a full time or part time basis on year compliance issues and related issues  such as back office processing and integration of rowecom s catalog with its strategic partners 
at present  no employees are working full time on year compliance issues 
rowecom has focused  and will continue to focus  its year compliance efforts on the following types of critical systems in house information technology 
rowecom has developed an application for use in all client operations  including order processing and report generation 
this application  which was designed and developed entirely by rowecom s in house development staff  was designed to be year compliant 
accordingly  rowecom did not incur  and does not expect in the future to incur  any material costs as a result of any year problems with its in house information technology 
rowecom does not believe that any of its other in house information technology systems are critical systems 
third party information technology 
rowecom believes the only information technology licensed from third parties that constitutes a critical system is the navision accounting software used by rowecom s finance and human resources departments and deployed on a client server system 
in its contract with rowecom  navision represents that its system is year compliant 
to date  rowecom has not experienced any problems with this application as a result of the year date change 
third party operations 
the critical systems maintained by third parties include the electronic data interchange transaction system  also known in the industry as edi  which carries out rowecom s transactions with publishers  the cybercash credit card transaction processing system that rowecom uses to clear credit card purchases  the automated clearing house transaction system  also known in the industry as ach  pursuant to which rowecom clears automatic debit purchases  and the catalog and purchasing operations maintained by barnesandnoble 
com 
to date  rowecom has not experienced any problems with these systems as a result of the year date change 
rowecom believes that it has already incurred the majority of the expenses that it expects to incur to deal with year issues 
rowecom has funded costs incurred to date from working capital and prior financings and will fund any additional costs incurred from working capital 
although rowecom currently believes that the critical systems that it operates will be year compliant  there can be no assurance that all of such systems and the other critical systems maintained by third parties on behalf of rowecom will continue to be year compliant 
a failure by any of rowecom s critical systems to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect upon its future results of operations and financial condition 
rowecom is not able to assess the impact of the year date change on its clients 
in the event that a significant number of its clients face difficulties as a result of the year date change  such clients may be unable to process purchases through the kstore  or may face budgetary constraints that limit knowledge resource purchasing 
any diminished purchasing by rowecom s clients as a result of year difficulties could have a material adverse effect on rowecom s future results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exchange rate risk management rowecom enters into forward currency contracts primarily in european and canadian currencies to hedge its foreign currency exposures 
forward currency contracts have maturities of less than one year 
these contracts are used to reduce rowecom s risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
rowecom does not engage in currency speculation 
at december  the face amount of outstanding forward currency contracts to buy and sell us dollars for us currencies was million 
a decrease in exchange rates for these currencies would decrease the fair value by approximately  however  since these contracts hedge non us currency transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transactions being hedged 
the hypothetical movement was estimated by calculating the fair value of the forward currency contracts at december  and comparing that with those calculated using hypothetical forward currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk management due to its short term duration  the fair value of rowecom s borrowings at december  approximated carrying value 
interest rate risk was estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
the resulting hypothetical fair value was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
we will adopt sfas no 
as required by sfas no 
 deferral of the effective date of the fasb statement no 
 in fiscal year to date we have not utilized derivative instruments or hedging activities and  therefore  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes the sec s view in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the application of the guidance in sab will be required in rowecom s first quarter of the fiscal year the effects of applying this guidance  if any  will be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment resulting from a change in accounting principle 
rowecom does not expect the adoption of sab to have a material effect on their financial statements  however the final evaluation of sab is not yet complete
