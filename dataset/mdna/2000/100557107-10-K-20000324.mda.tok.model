item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business environment the boston beer company is engaged in the business of brewing and selling malt beverages and cider products primarily in the domestic market and  to a lesser extent  in selected international markets 
the alcoholic beverage industry is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels 
the federal treasury department s bureau of alcohol  tobacco  and firearms batf enforce laws under the federal alcohol administration act 
the batf is responsible for enacting excise tax laws that directly affect the company s results of operations 
state and regulatory authorities have the ability to suspend or revoke the company s licenses and permits or impose substantial fines for violations 
the company has established strict guidelines in efforts to ensure compliance with all state and federal laws 
however  the loss or revocation of any existing license or permit could have a material effect on the company s business  results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
the company s beer products compete in what the company defines as the better beer category 
the defining factors for better beer includes price  quality  image and taste  and the category includes imports and craft beers 
the company prices its beers at a premium compared to domestic mass produced beers but at a level consistent with other beers in the better beer category 
the company believes that this pricing is appropriate given the quality and reputation of its core brands  while realizing that economic pricing pressures may affect future pricing levels 
in addition  the company produces products that are positioned in the cider segment of alcoholic beverages 
the better beer category is highly competitive due to the large number of craft brewers and the recent gains in market share achieved by imported beers 
although  the craft beer industry has recently experienced some consolidation  the company anticipates competition to remain strong as brewers retrench to their locally contained key markets and core brands 
import brewers are able to compete more aggressively as they have substantially greater resources  marketing strength and distribution networks than the company 
certain major domestic brewers have developed niche brands and are acquiring interests in craft beers 
as a result  the company has experienced increased competition  as such brewers can support their products with extensive advertising and promotions 
the described competitive environment has affected the company s overall performance within the better beer category 
the company has lost market share and its revenue growth rate has become stagnant 
as the market matures and the better beer category continues to consolidate  boston beer believes that companies that are well positioned in terms of brand equity  marketing and distribution will prosper 
with approximately distributors nationwide and salespeople  a commitment to maintaining brand equity  and the quality of its beer  the company believes it is well positioned to compete in a maturing market 
prior to the acquisition of the cincinnati brewery  the company operated with the strategy of contract brewing  which utilizes the excess capacity of other breweries 
in  the company brewed approximately of the company s products at the cincinnati brewery and approximately at non company owned breweries 
this strategy provides the company with flexibility in addition to quality and cost advantages and increased cash flows 
the company follows strict guidelines in selecting the appropriate brewery and monitoring the production process in order to ensure that quality and control standards are attained 
currently  the company believes that it will have adequate capacity for the production of its products for the foreseeable future 
the demand for the company s products is subject to changes in consumers tastes 
since the company began brewing beer  consumers preferences have shifted towards more flavorful  higher quality beers increasing the demand for better beer products 
the company s product strategy is in line with this trend 
however  certain of its styles appear to be adversely affected by a counter trend toward more mainstream lighter styles 
a change in consumer tastes or in the demand for better beer products may affect the company s future results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
the company cannot predict whether the trend toward full bodied  more flavorful beers will continue 
results of operations please see footnote o to the consolidated financial statements for quarterly financial results of the company 
for purposes of this discussion  boston beer s core brands include all products sold under the samuel adams  oregon original or hardcore trademarks 
core brands do not include the products brewed at the cincinnati brewery under contract arrangements for third parties 
volume produced under contract arrangements is referred to below as non core products 
boston beer s flagship brand is samuel adams boston lager boston lager 
the following table sets forth certain items included in the company s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales years ended december  december  december  barrels sold in thousands percentage of net sales sales less excise taxes net sales cost of sales gross profit advertising  promotional  and selling expenses general and administrative expenses total operating expenses operating income other expense income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decline is primarily due to a decrease in volume 
volume 
volume decreased by  barrels  or  of which  barrels was due to a decline in the production of non core products 
total volume relating to non core products was  barrels for the year ended december  as compared to  barrels for the year ended december  volume for core brands declined  barrels or of total core volume to  barrels for the year ended december  this decrease was due to a decline in year round beer styles  other than boston lager 
net selling price 
the net selling price per barrel increased by or less than to per barrel for the year ended december  this is due to normal price increases and a decline in sales of non core products  which have a lower selling price than core brands 
these increases were partially offset by changes in the packaging mix of core brands 
significant changes in the packaging mix would have a material effect on sales 
the company packages its core brands in bottles and kegs 
assuming the same level of production  a shift in the mix from bottles to kegs would effectively decrease revenue per barrel  as the price per equivalent barrel is greater for bottles than for kegs 
the percentage of kegs to bottles increased only slightly in core brands to of total shipments relating to kegs during from in the prior year and therefore did not have a significant effect on revenue per barrel during gross profit 
gross profit increased to as a percentage of net sales or per barrel for the year ended december   as compared to as a percentage of net sales or per barrel for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit is primarily due to a decline in cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased by per barrel to as a percentage of net sales or per barrel for the year ended december   as compared to as a percentage of net sales or per barrel for the year ended december  this is primarily due to lower costs of certain raw materials and improvements in the production efficiency of the cincinnati brewery 
raw material costs were lower due to new contracts with certain vendors  and continued favorable prices on cyclical items such as corrugated materials and malt 
expenses related to excess hops inventory and purchase commitment contracts amounted to million for the year ended december  as compared million for the same period last year 
see hops purchase commitments below for further discussion 
the company has substantially increased the utilization of the cincinnati brewery for its own products and has focused on maximizing safety  quality and efficiencies within the plant 
advertising  promotional and selling 
advertising  promotional and selling expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  advertising  promotional and selling expenses increased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period last year  primarily due to higher advertising and point of sale expenditures  which were partially offset by lower expenditures in freight 
the company invested an increased amount in outdoor advertising expenditures and market research during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the company continues to utilize its resources to develop television advertising campaigns 
it is anticipated that a new television campaign will be launched during the first half of increased point of sale expenses are largely due to the timing of the change in the company s logo during the anticipation of the logo change resulted in significantly lower expenditures incurred in purchases of promotional items during the prior year as compared to the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or to million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period last year 
the decrease is primarily due to declines in bad debt expense and legal expenditures 
the decline in bad debt expense is a result of continued significant improvements achieved in cash collections during the year ended december  legal expenditures declined by  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in trademark and regulatory expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense declined by  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decline in interest expense is due to the repayment on march  of the million outstanding balance under the then existing lines of credit 
at december   million was outstanding under the then existing million portion of the lines of credit 
see footnote g to the consolidated financial statements for further explanation 
interest income 
interest income increased by  to million for the year ended december  this increase is due to an increase in average cash and short term investments from approximately million during to million during other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  increased by million to income of  for the year ended december  as compared to an expense of million for same period last year 
the significant expense recognized in the prior year was due to a million loss realized on the disposition of a marketable equity security and  in losses incurred on the revaluation of foreign exchange forward contracts 
there were no such activities during provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the effective tax rate reflects a million loss realized on the sale of a marketable equity security during the second quarter  the company does not expect to fully realize the tax benefit associated with this capital loss 
there was no such activity during see footnote h to the consolidated financial statements for further explanation 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased by  or less than to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decline was primarily due to a decrease in volume 
volume 
volume decreased by  barrels  of which  barrels was due to a decline in the production of non core products 
total volume relating to non core products was  barrels for the year ended december  as compared to  barrels for the year ended december  volume for boston beer s core brands declined by  barrels to  barrels for the year ended december  this decline was due to continued sales declines of the oregon original brands and other year round beer styles  offset by an increase in the sale of boston lager and ciders 
sales for seasonal brands were stable during as compared to the decline in oregon original brands was partially due to the discontinuance of certain styles during and the decline in the year round styles is indicative of the market continuing to mature as consumers become less inclined to experiment with new styles 
net selling price 
the selling price per barrel increased by  or to per barrel for the year ended december  this was partially due to a decline in sales of non core products 
revenue contributed from non core products is significantly lower per barrel than revenue contributed from core brands 
the decline of shipments of non core products improved average net sales by per barrel  or 
the remaining increase in net selling price per barrel was due to normal price increases and to a lesser extent  changes in the packaging mix 
significant changes in the packaging mix would have a material effect on sales 
the company packages its core brands in bottles and kegs 
assuming the same level of production  a shift in the mix from kegs to bottles would effectively increase revenue per barrel  as the price per equivalent barrel is greater for bottles than for kegs 
the ratio of kegs to bottles declined only slightly in core brands to of total shipments relating to kegs during from in the prior year and therefore did not have a significant effect on revenue per barrel during gross profit 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  increased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  cost of sales decreased to as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  this was primarily due to a decline in barrels shipped related to non core products  improvements in the production process at the cincinnati brewery  and lower costs of certain raw materials 
increases in hop inventory related expenses and depreciation expense partially offset these declines 
the gross profit margin on non core products is significantly lower than for core brands 
therefore  the decline in the non core product volume increased gross profit per barrel for the company as a whole 
the decline in volume relating to non core products resulted in an increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales of approximately 
the company recognized an expense of million during in order to accrue for anticipated losses from existing hops purchase commitments 
additionally  the company incurred expenditures of million during relating to the cancellation of certain hops contracts 
see hops purchase commitments below for further discussion 
depreciation expense increased by  or  during as compared to this increase resulted from the depreciation of several capital assets acquired during relating to keg purchases and modifications to kegging and bottling lines at various breweries 
in accordance with the company s depreciation policy  one half of a year s worth of depreciation is recognized during the year of acquisition 
additional factors that may affect gross profit include changes in the packaging and product mix 
the company packages its core brands in bottles and kegs 
while gross profit as a percentage of net sales is higher for kegs than for bottles  the per equivalent barrel gross profit is higher for bottles than for kegs  in absolute terms 
therefore  an increase in kegs as a percentage of physical volume while increasing the overall gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales  will deliver fewer absolute gross profit dollars with which to run the business 
in keg sales as a percentage of total equivalent barrels of core brands declined to from in however  the gross profit per equivalent barrel increased in absolute dollars for both kegs and bottles due to revenue increases and cost decreases for both types of packages 
the net result of the packaging mix shift and the per unit profit improvement was an increase in gross profit per equivalent barrel in both absolute and percentage terms in the core business 
gross profit was not significantly affected during by a change in product mix from the previous year 
seasonal and year round beers can be more expensive to produce and increased pricing may not offset the additional expenses 
gross profit is not significantly affected by changes in brewing locations 
the company attempts to minimize total costs  including freight  by shifting production between plants 
during  the company shifted production in order to maximize utilization in the cincinnati brewery  while ensuring cost efficient production 
advertising  promotional  and selling 
advertising  promotional  and selling expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decline in total salaries  other employee related expenditures  local marketing and point of sale expenditures  which were partially offset by an increase in advertising expenditures 
the decline in salaries  other employee related expenditures and local marketing expenditures was primarily due to a decline in sales personnel headcount of approximately from the previous year 
the company reorganized the sales division during the first quarter of in an effort to achieve improved efficiencies 
the company remains committed to maintaining a strong and efficient sales force 
in addition  improved policies and controls relating to sales related expenditures contributed to the decline 
point of sale expenditures declined primarily due to increased utilization of internally developed promotional and marketing campaigns 
this has served to increase the quality and efficiency of brand development activities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or as compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to a change in bad debt expense from a recovery of  during fiscal year to an expense of  during fiscal year the cash collections process was significantly improved during and resulted in the recovery of previously written off amounts 
net of this factor  general and administrative expenses were flat as compared to the prior year 
interest income 
interest income increased by  due to an increase in average cash and short term investments from approximately million during to million during other expense  net 
other expense increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million loss realized on the sale of a marketable security in fiscal year income taxes 
the effective income tax rate increased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the million loss realized on the sale of a marketable equity security during  as the company does not expect to fully realize the tax benefit associated with such loss 
liquidity and capital resources the company s financial condition continued to be strong during cash and short term investments decreased to million for the year ended december  from million as of december  this decrease was primarily due to the repayment of million in bank debt on march  and the repurchase of company stock at a cost of million 
cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december   which was comparable to the prior year  partially offset these cash outflows 
effective october   the board authorized management to implement a stock repurchase program  subject to an aggregate expenditure limitation of million 
as of december   the company repurchased  shares under this program at a cost of million 
effective january   the board authorized management to repurchase additional shares  subject to an incremental expenditure limitation of million 
this authorization increases the stock repurchase program to an aggregate expenditure limitation of million 
the company had cash inflows of million resulting from maturities of short term investments during the year ended december  as compared to cash outflows of million due to the investment of net positive cash flows in government securities during the company has historically invested its excess cash in money market funds  short term treasury and agency bills  and high grade commercial paper 
a marketable equity security  which was purchased in  was sold during the second quarter of at a loss of million 
with working capital of million and million in unused bank lines of credit as of december   the company believes that its existing resources should be sufficient to meet the company s short term and long term operating and capital requirements 
the potential impact of known facts  commitments  events and uncertainties year the company believes that is has successfully completed its system remediation efforts regarding date recognition for the year the total cost incurred related to the year conversion efforts of its internal systems were approximately  as of march   the company has not encountered any problems processing date information in the year the year issue has had no material effect on the company s results of operations  statement of financial position or statement of cash flows for the year ending december   nor does the company anticipate that this issue will have a material effect on its financial position or operations going forward 
brewery related transactions effective april   stroh brewing company sold a majority of its beer brands and the lehigh brewery to pabst brewing company pabst and certain brands to miller brewing company miller collectively  the stroh transactions 
pabst assumed stroh s obligations under the existing brewing contract between the company and stroh  miller has guaranteed pabst s performance 
the company s volume brewed at the lehigh brewery has remained substantially unchanged as a result of the stroh transactions 
as anticipated  stroh closed its portland  oregon brewery during the third quarter the company s volume  which was historically brewed at the portland brewery  was transferred to the tumwater brewery 
miller purchased the tumwater brewery from pabst during the third quarter and has assumed pabst s obligations to brew the company s products at the tumwater brewery 
the resulting shift in production  which was completed during  did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  statement of financial position or cash flows for the year ended december  hops purchase commitments the company enters into purchase commitments for hops based upon forecasted future requirements  among other factors 
in recent years the company s sales growth has declined  resulting in an increase in hops inventory 
as a result  existing purchase commitments may exceed projected future needs over the life of such commitments 
the company recorded a provision of million and million in and  respectively  to reserve for estimated excess purchase commitments and excess inventory on hand 
the company continues to manage inventory levels in an effort to maximize utilization of hops on hand and hops under commitment 
the company recorded a million and million charge associated with the cancellation of purchase commitment contracts during the year ended december  and december   respectively 
there was no reserve for hops contract losses required  or contract cancellation costs incurred in the computation of the excess purchase commitment reserve requires management to make certain assumptions regarding future sales growth  product mix  cancellation costs and supply  among others 
actual results may differ materially from management s estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement requires that all derivative financial instruments be reflected on the balance sheet at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized periodically in earnings or as a component of equity  depending on the nature of the underlying instrument being hedged 
in the event that an entity does not effectively hedge against the underlying derivative  changes in the fair market value of the underlying derivative will be recognized currently in the income statement 
as issued  sfas is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  which delayed the effective date of sfas for one year  to fiscal years beginning after june  the company typically enters into commitments to purchase hops that extend six years with various hop growers 
these purchase contracts  which extend through crop year  are denominated in the currency of the country in which the hops are grown 
additionally  the company enters into commitments to purchase apple juices  which typically extend less than one year and are denominated in a foreign currency 
in the event that the company does not effectively hedge against fluctuations in the respective foreign currency  the impact of the currency fluctuation on the purchase price will be recognized in the income statement 
currently  it is the company s policy not to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
management is currently evaluating the effect that sfas is expected to have on the company s financial statements 
other risks and uncertainties a claim has been asserted against the company and its subsidiary  samuel adams brewery company  ltd  as alleged successors to the schoenling brewing company schoenling  by the city of cincinnati  ohio for closure costs and related remedial response costs for the closure of a city landfill at which schoenling previously disposed of certain materials 
neither the company nor its subsidiary has ever made use of this landfill 
the company does not believe that it is legally a successor to schoenling s business and is vigorously contesting the claim 
further  schoenling has agreed to indemnify the company with respect to this claim 
the company does not believe that this claim will have a material  adverse effect upon the future results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
changes in general economic conditions could result in numerous events that may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
numerous factors that could adversely affect the company s operating income  cash flows and financial position  include but are not limited to a slowing of the growth rate of the better beer category  share of market erosion of boston lager and seasonal beers due to increased competition  more rapid decline than anticipated in oregon original beers and other samuel adams year round styles an unexpected decline in the brewing capacity available to the company  increased advertising and promotional expenditures that are not followed by higher sales volume  higher than planned costs of operating the cincinnati brewery  adverse fluctuations in raw material or packaging costs which cannot be passed along through increased prices  world hop market conditions affecting the company s ability to buy or sell hops or cancel existing excess hop commitments  poor weather conditions  resulting in an inadequate supply of raw materials that are agriculturally grown  adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in control or ownership of the current distribution network which leads to less support of the company s products  and increases in the costs of distribution 
the company continues to brew its samuel adams boston lager at each of its brewing facilities  but at any particular time may rely on only one supplier for its products other than boston lager 
the company believes that it has sufficient capacity options that would allow for a shift in production locations if necessary 
in the event of a labor dispute  governmental action or other events that would prevent either the cincinnati brewery or any of the contract breweries from producing the company s beer  management believes that it would be able to shift production between breweries so as to meet demand for its beer 
in such event  however  the company could experience temporary shortfalls in production and or increased production or distribution costs  the combination of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
historically  the company has not experienced material difficulties in obtaining timely delivery from its suppliers 
although the company believes that there are alternate sources available for the ingredients and packaging materials  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to acquire such ingredients or packaging materials from substitute sources on a timely or cost effective basis in the event that current suppliers could not adequately fulfill orders 
the loss of a supplier could  in the short term  adversely affect the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position until alternative supply arrangements were secured 
hops and malt are agricultural products and therefore many outside factors  including weather conditions  crop production  government regulations and legislation affecting agriculture  could effect both price and supply

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other market risk sensitive instruments for the purpose of speculation or for trading purposes 
market risk sensitive instruments include derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
such instruments that are exposed to rate or price changes should be included in the sensitivity analysis disclosure 
the only purchased ingredient or material that the company would consider a commodity for the purpose of measuring market risk is two row malt  which is made from two row barley 
the company has entered into a contract that guarantees a fixed price for the purchase of two row malt based upon need and therefore is not at risk to potential short term market fluctuations 
the company does not enter into derivative commodity instruments ie futures  forwards  swaps  options  ie the company enters into hops purchase contracts in foreign denominated currencies  as described above under hops purchase commitments 
the purchase price changes as foreign exchange rates fluctuate 
during and  the company used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the impact of such foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
as of december   the company had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
sensitivity analysis the company applies a sensitivity analysis to reflect the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign currency rates and interest rates 
the estimated potential one day loss in fair value of the company s debt and the estimated potential loss in pretax earnings from a potential one day adverse fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates as of december  and december  are as follows in thousands as of december  as of december  earnings impact fair value impact earnings impact fair value impact foreign currency rates interest rates it should be noted that the potential earnings impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to contracts that extend five years 
therefore  the above reflects the maximum potential pretax earnings impact over a five year period  under current accounting principles 
there are many economic factors that can affect volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
as such factors cannot be predicted  the actual impact on earnings and fair value due to an adverse change in the respective rates and prices could vary substantially from the amounts calculated above 
as of december   the company had million of debt outstanding under its then existing million line of credit 
on march   the company repaid the entire million in borrowings outstanding on its then existing facility 
as of december   the company had no amounts outstanding under its current million line of credit
