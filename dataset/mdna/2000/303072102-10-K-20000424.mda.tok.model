the net loss applicable to common stock was million in fiscal compared to a net loss applicable to common stock of million in fiscal the improvement in the net loss applicable to common stock was due to the operating and other factors cited above 
liquidity and capital resources general as of january   we had outstanding indebtedness in the principal amount of million 
we finance our operations through credit provided by vendors and other suppliers  amounts borrowed under our million revolving credit facility and internally generated cash flow 
credit terms provided by vendors and other suppliers are usually net days 
amounts which may be borrowed under the revolving credit facility are based on a percentage of eligible inventories and receivables  as defined  outstanding from time to time  as more fully described below 
revolving credit facility at january   we had a revolving credit facility under which we could borrow up to million at the prime rate plus  subject to limitations based on inventory levels 
at that time  we had no outstanding balance and approximately million of availability 
we were not in compliance with the current ratio covenant as of january  subsequent to year end  we entered into a new million revolving credit facility with another financial institution and terminated the prior revolving credit facility 
under our new revolving credit facility we may borrow up to of our eligible inventory and of our eligible receivables  as defined  not to exceed million 
the new credit facility also provides a million subfacility for letters of credit 
interest on the credit facility is at the prime rate  or at our election  libor plus 
under the terms of the new credit facility  the interest rate may increase or decrease subject to earnings  as defined  on a rolling four fiscal quarter basis 
accordingly  prime rate borrowings could range from prime to prime plus and libor borrowing from libor plus to libor plus 
at march   the prime interest rate was 
the new credit facility expires on march   subject to automatic one year renewal periods  unless terminated earlier by either party 
we are obligated to pay fees equal to per annum on the unused amount of the new credit facility 
the new credit facility is secured by a first lien on accounts receivable and inventory and requires us to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth in the event that our borrowing availability is less than a specified amount 
subordinated notes in fiscal  we exchanged existing subordinated reorganization notes and junior subordinated reorganization notes for new subordinated notes and new junior subordinated notes that eliminated an estimated excess cash flow calculation previously used to determine the timing and amount of payments and provided a fixed debt payment schedule 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  we accounted for the exchange of the old notes as an extinguishment of debt  and  in connection therewith  recorded an extraordinary loss  net of tax benefit  of million 
this loss represented increases in the present value of the principal amount of the old notes and fees paid to the lenders 
the fees included the issuance of  shares of pre recapitalization common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of pre recapitalization common stock  both stated at fair market value when they were issued 
the new subordinated notes totaled million and were fully paid on december  the new junior subordinated notes are non interest bearing and are reflected on our balance sheets at the present value using a discount rate of 
as of january   the new junior subordinated notes had a face value of million and a related unamortized discount of million  resulting in a net carrying value of million 
the discount is amortized to interest expense as a non cash charge until the notes are paid in full 
we made a principal payment on the new junior subordinated notes of million during fiscal additional principal payments are scheduled on december  million  on december  and december  million  on december  and december  million and a final payment on may  million 
we believe that our sources of cash  including the new credit facility  will be adequate to finance our operations  capital requirements and debt obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months 
capital expenditures we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal which includes costs to open new stores  to renovate and relocate existing stores  to construct a new distribution center  to upgrade information systems and to renovate and expand our administrative offices 
we believe that future capital expenditures will be financed from internal cash flow and borrowings under our new credit facility 
inflation in general  we believe that inflation has had no recent material impact on our operations and none is anticipated in the next fiscal year 
minimum wage increases we employ  both in our stores and in our corporate headquarters  a substantial number of employees who earn hourly wages near or at the minimum wage 
actions by both the federal and certain state governments have increased and may continue to increase the hourly wages that we must pay to such employees 
historically  we have mitigated such increases through policies to manage our ratio of wages to sales 
however  we can make no assurances that these measures and other steps taken will be adequate to control the impact of any hourly wage increases in the future and may have a negative impact on profitability in the future 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations we have historically realized our highest levels of sales and income during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the quarters ending in october and january as a result of the back to school august and september and holiday november and december seasons 
the seasonally lower sales in our first two quarters february through july  can result in losses during those quarters  even in years in which we will have full year profits 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer systems and software products coded to accept only digit entries in the date code field 
this could have resulted in system failure or the generation of erroneous data in systems that do not properly recognize such information 
we diligently addressed the potential year issue by utilizing both internal and external resources as applicable  to identify  correct or reprogram our internal systems for year compliance 
in fiscal  we implemented a new integrated software package to support future growth and to address the issues associated with the year at a cost of approximately million 
to date  we have not experienced any significant business disruptions or system failures as a result of the year issue 
none of our major vendors  service providers and customers have reported substantial year related problems 
although the year event has occurred  and while there can be no assurance that there will be no problems related to the year issue after january   we believe we will not be adversely impacted by the year issue 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
this sab summarizes the sec s view in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
this sab was amended by sab no 
a  which defers the effective date for all registrants with fiscal years that begin between december  and march   to allow for the adoption of implementing during the second quarter of fiscal we have reviewed the impact of sab no 
on our financial statements  and do not believe that its adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement was amended by sfas no 
which defers the effective date to all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
is effective for our first quarter in the fiscal year beginning february  and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
cautionary statement for purposes of safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in december  congress enacted the private securities litigation reform act of the act contains amendments to the securities act of and the securities exchange act of which provide protection from liability in private lawsuits for forward looking statements made by specified persons 
we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
certain statements in this annual report on form k  or in documents incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k  are forward looking statements 
those forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties that may cause the actual results to differ from the results anticipated by the forward looking statements 
factors which may cause actual results to differ from those anticipated by forward looking statements include  among others  general economic and business conditions both nationally and in the regions in which we operate  government regulations including regulations regarding temporary immigration of agricultural works and minimum wages of agricultural and other workers  claims asserted against us  competition  changes in our business strategy or development plans  difficulties attracting and retaining qualified personnel  the inability to obtain adequate quantities of merchandise at favorable prices  and the other factors described in this annual report on form k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate debt obligations 
at january   fixed rate debt obligations totaled approximately million 
the fixed rate debt obligations are non interest bearing and are discounted at a rate of  resulting in a net carrying value of million 
maturities are million  million  million  million  million and million in fiscal year     and  respectively 
while generally an increase in market interest rates will decrease the value of this debt  and decreases in rates will have the opposite effect  we are unable to estimate the impact that interest rate changes will have on the value of this debt as there is no active public market for the debt and we are unable to determine the market interest rate at which alternate financing would have been available at january
