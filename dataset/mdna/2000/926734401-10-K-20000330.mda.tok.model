overview we are a leading global provider of e business application software products and services 
our e business solutions are designed to enable businesses to build successful and sustainable online businesses 
our e business solutions allow both traditional brick and mortar and startup dot com businesses to create and manage internet business channels that are designed to attract  engage and retain their customers  partners  and suppliers online 
using our solutions  our clients build e business applications which are focused on personalized and mass customized multiple touchpoints and communication channels 
we were founded in december to date  we have developed and released several versions of our storyserver product and have sold our products and services to clients 
we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through our direct sales force but also market through third party providers 
we derive our revenue from the sale of software product licenses and from professional consulting  maintenance and support services 
product license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered  we have no remaining significant obligations with regard to implementation  the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is probable 
services revenue consists of fees from professional services and from maintenance and telephone support 
professional services include integration of software  application development  training and software installation 
we bill professional services fees either on a time and materials or on a fixed price basis 
we recognize professional services fees billed on a time and materials basis as the services are performed 
we recognize professional services fees on fixed price service arrangements on the completion of specific contractual milestone events  or based on an estimated percentage of completion as work progresses 
we recognize estimated losses on fixed priced service arrangements  if any  when it becomes apparent a loss is to be incurred 
our clients typically purchase maintenance agreements annually  and we price maintenance agreements based on a percentage of our current product list price 
we price telephone support based on differing levels of support 
clients purchasing maintenance agreements receive unspecified product upgrades and electronic  web based technical support  while purchasers of support contracts receive additional telephone support 
we recognize revenue from maintenance and support agreements ratably over the term of the agreement  typically one year 
we record cash receipts from clients and billed amounts due from clients in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue 
the timing and amount of cash receipts from clients can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on the amount of deferred revenue in any given period 
cost of revenue consists of costs to manufacture  package and distribute our products and related documentation  as well as personnel and other expenses related to providing professional services 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our engineering  sales and marketing and professional services departments  and to establish an administrative organization 
as a result  we have incurred significant losses since inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we believe our success depends on further increasing our client base and on growth in the emerging e business solutions market 
accordingly  we intend to continue to invest heavily in sales  marketing  professional services  research and development and in our operational and financial systems 
furthermore  we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses  excluding amortization of intangibles and stock based compensation  at least through the third quarter of  and our expected increase in operating expenses will require significant increases in revenues before we become profitable 
we had full time employees at december   up from december  this rapid growth places a significant demand on our management and operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
in addition  we expect that future expansion will continue to challenge our ability to hire  train  motivate  and manage our employees 
competition is intense for highly qualified technical  sales and marketing and management personnel 
if our total revenue does not increase relative to our operating expenses  our management systems do not expand to meet increasing demands  we fail to attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel  or our management otherwise fails to manage our expansion effectively  there would be a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
effective june   we acquired diffusion  inc  a developer of multi channel information delivery solutions  in exchange for  shares of vignette common stock 
the total cost of the acquisition  including transaction costs  was approximately million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination 
accordingly  the results of operations of diffusion have been included with our results of operations for periods subsequent to the date of acquisition  and the acquired net assets were recorded at their estimated fair values at the effective date of the acquisition 
upon the closing of the acquisition on june   we incurred a one time charge totaling million for the write off of in process research and development  acquisition related expenses and integration costs 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of revenues represented by certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations 
year ended december  consolidated statements of operations data revenue product license services total revenue cost of revenue product license services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development  acquisition related  and other charges amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of intangibles total operating expenses loss from operations other income  net net loss revenue total revenue increased to million in from million in and from million in this increase was attributable to an increase in our client base  which grew from at the end of to at the end of and to at the end of  an increase in the average deal size of new client orders and follow on orders from existing clients 
although our total revenue has increased in recent periods  we cannot be certain that total revenue will grow in future periods or that it will grow at similar rates as in the past 
product license 
product license revenue increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in product license revenue in absolute dollars was due to increases in the number of clients and the average deal size of new client orders resulting from growing market acceptance of our storyserver product line over prior periods  as well as increased follow on orders from existing clients 
product license revenue decreased as a percentage of total revenue in and due to the higher growth in services revenue during the same period 
services 
services revenue increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
services revenue from professional services fees continue to be the primary component of total services revenue  representing of total revenues in as compared to in and in the increase in all types of services revenue was due primarily to an increase in the number of clients and the sale of product licenses  which generally include or lead to contracts to perform professional services and purchases of software maintenance and technical support service agreements 
services revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue in and due to the expansion of our services capabilities through the hiring of additional services personnel 
we believe that growth in our product license sales depends on our ability to provide our clients with support  training  consulting and implementation services and educating third party resellers on how to implement our products 
as a result  we continued to expand our professional services organization throughout and intend to continue expanding our professional services organization for the foreseeable future 
we do not believe that services revenue will continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue 
cost of revenue product license 
product license costs consist of expenses we incur to manufacture  package and distribute our products and related documentation and costs of licensing third party software incorporated into our products 
product license costs increased to million in from  in and from  in  representing  and of product license revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars in each period and as a percentage of product license revenue in was principally a result of both product license sales growth and royalties paid to third party vendors for technology embedded in our product offerings 
product license costs decreased as a percentage of product license revenue in primarily because significant product license revenue growth outpaced increases in product license costs in addition to a higher average sales price in relative to we expect product license costs to increase in the future in absolute dollar terms due to additional clients licensing our products and the acquisition of oem licenses to third party technology that we may choose to embed in our product offerings 
services 
services costs include salary expense and other related costs for our professional service  maintenance and customer support staffs  as well as third party contractor expenses 
services costs increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of services revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars resulted from rapidly expanding our services organization 
the overall improvement in services gross profit margin reflects increased leverage from the productivity of support  training  consulting and implementation activities 
we expect services costs to increase in the future in absolute dollars to the extent that services revenues increase 
we expect services costs as a percentage of services revenue to decrease over time 
services costs as a percentage of services revenue can be expected to vary significantly from period to period depending on the mix of services we provide  whether such services are provided by us or third party contractors  and overall utilization rates 
professional services related costs increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of professional services related revenue 
to date  services costs related to professional services have exceeded  or have been substantially equal to  professional service related revenue 
although we expect our professional service related revenue will exceed professional service related costs in future periods  we cannot be certain when this will occur 
maintenance and support related costs increased to million in from  in and from  in  representing  and of maintenance and support related revenue  respectively 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was due to the increase in engineering personnel and to the expansion of our product offerings 
the decrease in research and development as a percentage of total revenue resulted primarily because significant revenue growth outpaced increases in research and development expenditures 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to maintaining a competitive advantage  and  as a result  we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
software development costs that were eligible for capitalization in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  were insignificant during the periods presented 
accordingly  most development costs have been expensed in the period incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  public relations and marketing materials and tradeshows 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars due to a significant increase in sales and marketing personnel  increased marketing program expenditures as well as higher commissions resulting from the absolute dollar growth in our bookings 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue resulted primarily because significant revenue growth outpaced increases in sales and marketing expenditures 
we believe these expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we expect to continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts to promote further growth 
we also anticipate that sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period as new sales personnel are hired and begin to achieve productivity and the timing of new product releases 
during the fourth quarter of  we amended our sales commission plan to more closely match the payment of sales commissions with the culmination of the earnings process and the receipt of cash from the customer 
this amendment had the effect of reducing our commissions expense and net loss in the fourth quarter by million  or per share 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance employees  legal and accounting services and certain facilities related expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars for these periods was due to increased personnel and facility expenses necessary to support our expanding operations 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue primarily because significant revenue growth outpaced increases in general and administrative expenditures 
we believe general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expect to increase staffing and infrastructure expenses to support our continued growth 
purchased in process research and development  acquisition related and other charges 
in connection with our acquisition of diffusion in june  we incurred one time acquisition costs and integration related charges  which include costs associated with product integration  cross training  and other merger related costs 
additionally  a portion of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development based upon an independent third party appraisal and expensed upon the consummation of the transaction 
these related charges totaled million in included in the acquired net assets of diffusion was in process research and development efforts related to the development of diffusion server diffusion server was expected to expand the delivery capabilities  user features and functionality of the existing diffusion server multi channel platform as well as add new components 
we intend to re work the acquired technology and integrate it with vignette s products 
a significant amount of uncertainty existed surrounding the successful development and completion of the research and development acquired  which was estimated to be complete at the date of the acquisition 
we were uncertain of our ability to complete the development of a new product within a timeframe acceptable to the market and ahead of competitors 
additionally  the amount of development required to enable the acquired in process research and development to be compatible with storyserver is significant 
the results of the in process research and development effort at the time of purchase had not progressed to a stage where they met technological feasibility as they lacked many key elements including standardized implementation capabilities and a scalable and extensible architecture 
values of million were assigned to in process research and development and million to existing core technology based upon a modified discounted cash flow model 
the cash flow projections for revenue were based on the projected incremental increase in revenue that was expected to be received from the completed acquired in process research and development 
diffusion expected revenue to commence with its product s release in december and continue throughout its economic life of five years 
estimated operating expenses were deducted from estimated revenue to arrive at estimated pre tax cash flows 
projected operating expenses included cost of goods sold  selling general and administrative expense  and research and development expense 
operating expenses were estimated as a percent of revenue based on diffusion s historical results for the fiscal years ended december  to projected results for the fiscal years ended december  to were also used in combination with past operating results and industry averages 
capital charges  or cash flow attributable to other assets such as working capital and assembled workforce  were deducted from pre tax operating income to isolate the cash flow solely attributable to the in process research and development 
income taxes were then deducted to arrive at after tax cash flows 
the after tax cash flow projections were discounted using a risk adjusted rate of return of 
in using the discounted model  the costs to complete the in process technology were excluded from the research and development expense for  and the percentage completion of the in process research and development was reflected in each year s projected cash flow 
during may  we acquired from randomnoise  inc certain in process research and development effort  a developed product and an insignificant amount of equipment in exchange for million  consisting of  in cash and  shares of our series g preferred stock valued at million 
substantially all of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and expensed upon the consummation of the transaction 
these related charges totaled million in amortization of deferred stock compensation 
we have recorded deferred compensation for the difference between the exercise price of certain stock option grants and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants 
we are amortizing this amount over the vesting periods of the applicable options  resulting in amortization expense of million  million and in  and  respectively 
amortization of intangibles 
in conjunction with our acquisition of diffusion  effective june   the purchase price amounts allocated to acquired technology of million and workforce of  are being amortized over a five year period 
the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired of million is being amortized over a seven year period 
other income  net other income  net consists of interest income and expense and gain or loss on disposals of equipment 
other income  net increased to million in from  in and from  in the significant increase in was due to interest income earned from cash balances on hand as a result of our secondary and initial public offerings in december and february  respectively 
quarterly results the following tables set forth certain unaudited consolidated statements of operations data both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of our last eight quarters 
this data has been derived from unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited consolidated financial statements and  in our opinion  include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information 
these unaudited quarterly results should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this k

gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development  acquisition related  and other charges amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of intangibles total operating expenses loss from operations other income  net net loss as a result of our limited operating history  we cannot forecast operating expenses based on historical results 
accordingly  we base our forecast for expenses in part on future revenue projections 
most of these expenses are fixed in the short term  and we may not be able to quickly reduce spending if revenues are lower than we have projected 
our ability to forecast accurately our quarterly revenue is limited due to the long sales cycle of our software products  which makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which product implementation will occur  and the variability of client demand for professional services 
we would expect our business  operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected if revenues do not meet projections and that net losses in a given quarter would be even greater than expected 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and we expect our operating results will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a number of factors are likely to cause these variations  including 
demand for our products and services  
the timing of sales of our products and services  
the timing of customer orders and product implementations  
unexpected delays in introducing new products and services  
increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  product development or administration  
changes in the rapidly evolving market for e business solutions  
the mix of product license and services revenue  as well as the mix of products licensed  
the mix of services provided and whether services are provided by our own staff or third party contractors  
the mix of domestic and international sales  and 
costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
investors should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 
we plan to increase our operating expenses to expand sales and marketing operations  develop new distribution channels  fund greater levels of research and development  broaden professional services and support and improve operational and financial systems 
if our revenues do not increase along with these expenses  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected and net losses in a given quarter would be even greater than expected 
although we have a limited operating history  we believe that our quarterly operating results may experience seasonal fluctuations 
for instance  quarterly results may fluctuate based on client calendar year budgeting cycles  slow summer purchasing patterns in europe and our compensation policies that tend to compensate sales personnel  typically in the latter half of the year  for achieving annual quotas 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards as of december   we had federal net operating loss and research and development carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates  beginning  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an ownership change of a corporation 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards on an annual basis will be limited as a result of a prior ownership change in connection with private sales of equity securities 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss and research and development carryforwards  because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  management primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have funded our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements through the sale of equity securities 
cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities was due primarily to changes in operating working capital 
our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures totaling million  million and  in  and  respectively  to acquire property and equipment  mainly computer hardware and software  for our growing employee base 
in addition  during our investing activities included purchases of short term investments totaling million and purchases of equity securities totaling million for strategic investments in other e commerce companies 
the most significant investment occurred in october when we purchased equity securities of vitessa formerly ecdirect in exchange for million in cash 
the investment represents approximately a ownership position in vitessa  and provides a strategic partnership in which vignette will integrate vitessa s core technology for distributed e commerce into vignette s e business applications 
we expect that our investing activities will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we support our continued growth 
net cash provided by financing activities in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in was due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from our initial and secondary public offerings 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in working capital 
we have agreements with comdisco  inc providing for available credit of up to million over a period of months at an interest rate of per year and an equipment lease line of million over a period of months at an interest rate of per year 
the line of credit with comdisco  inc is secured by our receivables  equipment  fixtures  inventory and all other tangible property 
we are currently in compliance with all related financial covenants and restrictions 
subsequent to december   we continued to expand our product offerings through the acquisition of complementary businesses 
in january  we acquired percent of the outstanding stock and assumed all outstanding stock options of engine  ltd 
in exchange for million in cash and approximately  shares of vignette common stock 
we will integrate engine s java based application services into vignette s e business applications 
in february  we acquired percent of the outstanding stock and assumed all outstanding stock options of datasage  inc datasage in exchange for approximately million shares of vignette common stock 
we will integrate datasage s e marketing and personalization applications into vignette s e business applications 
based on our current operating plan  management believes that our cash on hand  cash equivalents  short term investments and commercial credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future  including working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures 
we may require additional funds for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public and private equity financings from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us or that any additional financing will not be dilutive 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
we adopted sop effective january  such adoption did not have a significant effect on our results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which defers for one year the effective date of statement as a result of the deferral provisions of statement  statement is now effective for our fiscal year we have minimal use of derivatives  except for our strategic investments which are generally in the form of redeemable convertible stock 
we have not determined the impact  if any  that the adoption of statement will have on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the securities and exchange commission staff released staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
we will adopt the provisions of sab for all transactions during the year ending december  the application of sab is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position 
year update the year issue refers generally to the problems that some software may have in determining the correct century for the year 
for example  software with date sensitive functions that is not year compliant may not be able to distinguish whether means or  which may result in failures or the creation of erroneous results 
in prior filings  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems  and we believe those systems successfully responded to the year date changes 
the amounts incurred and expensed for developing and carrying out the plans to complete the year modifications did not have a material effect on our operations 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from the year issue  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of our operations are based in the us and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have operations in australia  england  france  germany  hong kong and singapore and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
to date  the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of other currencies has not been material 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure 
our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in 
obligations of the us government and its agencies  
investment grade state and local government obligations  
securities of us corporations rated a or p by standard poors or the moody s equivalents  and or 
money market funds  deposits or notes issued or guaranteed by us and non us commercial banks meeting certain credit rating and net worth requirements with maturities of less than two years 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of demand deposits and money market funds held by large institutions in the us  and our short term investments were invested in corporate debt maturing in less than days
