as at march   systems employed approximately research and development personnel in canada  the united states  and the united kingdom 
government regulation pbxs are considered customer premise equipment cpe 
although the cpe market in the united states is not regulated  certain developments  which are described below  have changed the united states telecommunications market 
on february   the united states congress passed the telecommunications act of management believes that the legislation will continue to accelerate the convergence of the communications  information and entertainment industries while intensifying competition within those industries 
this legislation removes the line of business restrictions on the regional bell operating companies rbocs and allows the rbocs to enter the manufacturing sector at the time they are allowed into long distance markets 
for the first three years  any manufacturing by an rboc must be conducted through a separate affiliate and procurement from the subsidiary must be on a non discriminatory basis 
while it is not improbable that an rboc will eventually meet the minimum criteria for entry into the long distance market and thereby become eligible to begin manufacturing  it appears unlikely  at this time  that the majority of rbocs will commence both such activities in fiscal although there can be no assurance  management does not expect that such legislation will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in fiscal  in light of the existing competitive conditions in the united states market and the significant conditions required to be satisfied by the rbocs under such legislation before they can commence manufacturing 
the second development is a proposed regulation by the united states federal communications commission fcc which will impose certain enhanced application requirements e on cpe manufacturers 
certain states have already imposed such requirements and the federal government in the united states is poised to do likewise 
the telecommunications industry is advocating a proposed settlement that  if adopted  would be favorable to cpe manufacturers  including mitel  with regard to these proposed regulations 
the benefits to mitel from the settlement would result principally from the availability of certain exemptions with respect to lower line sizes as well as positive grandfathering provisions 
the state of illinois is likewise adopting favorable aspects of the industry s position as it amends its statute with respect to e illinois is in the forefront of state efforts in this regard 
the fcc also imposes installation and equipment standards for cpe and requires that all cpe marketed in the united states be registered with it and comply with these standards 
the company believes that it is currently in compliance with these requirements in all material respects 
the united states government promulgated regulations  which came into effect on november   regarding accessibility of telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment  pursuant to section of the telecommunications act of although there can be no assurance  such regulations were anticipated by mitel and management believes that ongoing compliance with such regulations  as they are phased in  should not have a material adverse effect on the results of mitel s operations in fiscal the company cannot now anticipate what impact such legislation and regulations may have on the results of its operations beyond fiscal or what further regulatory changes will occur in the communications equipment market and the competitive environment as a consequence of actions by the legislature  the fcc or the courts 
the canadian radio television and telecommunications commission crtc is the regulatory agency in canada governing most of the telecommunications industry 
currently  the cpe market in canada is an unregulated market and canadian carriers do not need crtc approved tariffs in order to sell terminal equipment 
the liberalization of access to telecommunications networks and competition in telecommunications services in the european union has proceeded at a steady pace through initiatives of the member states  as well as through deregulation initiatives of the european commission 
the deregulatory process has increased competition and opened markets for telecommunications vendors throughout europe

management believes that the ownership of patents is an important factor in exploiting associated inventions and for providing protection for its patentable technology in the areas referred to above 
the mitel trademark and the mitel corporate logo are registered in canada and the united states and have been registered in certain other countries where mitel conducts business 
most of the company s other trademarks are registered or applications for registration have been filed in various countries where management has determined such registration to be advisable 
management believes that the company s trademarks are valuable assets and generally supports applications for registration for marks in countries where the assessment of potential business related to the sale of products or services associated with such marks justifies such action 
the company also owns other intellectual property rights for which registration has not been pursued 
in addition to applying for statutory protection for certain intellectual property rights  the company takes various measures to protect such rights  including maintaining internal security programs and requiring certain nondisclosure and other provisions in contracts 
as is the case with many companies doing business in the telecommunications industry  it is necessary or desirable from time to time for the company to obtain licenses from third parties relating to technology for mitel s products and processes 
no current license is considered by management to be material to the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
forward looking statements and risk factors certain statements in this section and in other sections of this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the industries in which the company operates  management s beliefs and assumptions made by management 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions  which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from results forecast or suggested in such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
such risks  uncertainties and assumptions include  among others  the following increasing price and product service competition by foreign and domestic competitors  including new entrants  rapid technological developments and changes  the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products on a timely  cost effective basis  delays in product development  the mix of products services  changes in environmental and other domestic and foreign governmental regulations  protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights  import protection and regulation  industry competition  industry capacity and other industry trends  the ability of the company to attract and retain key employees  demographic changes and other factors referenced in this form k 
the above factors are representative of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements 
in addition  such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general domestic and international economic conditions including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including the following technological changes  necessity to develop and introduce new products the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving and competing industry standards  changes in customers  emerging competition  frequent new product introductions and evolving methods used by carriers and business enterprises to manage communications networks 
the company s future success will depend  in part  on its ability to use leading technologies effectively  to continue to develop its technical expertise  to maintain close working relationships with its key customers  to develop new products that meet changing customer needs  to advertise and market its products and to influence and respond to changing industry standards and other technological changes on a timely and cost effective basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in effectively developing or using new technologies  developing new products or enhancing its existing products on a timely basis or that such new technologies or enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
the company s pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense and there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in adapting its products or business to alternate technologies 
failure of the company  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new or enhanced products that are compatible with industry standards and that satisfy customer price and performance requirements would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company s competitors may offer enhancements to existing products or offer new products based upon new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements  that have the potential to replace or provide lower cost alternatives to the company s products  which could render the company s existing and future products obsolete  unmarketable or inoperable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop new products to compete with new technologies on a timely basis or in a cost effective manner 
see business mitel communications systems research and development and mitel semiconductor research and development 
competition the markets for the company s products are also characterized by intense competition 
with the development of the worldwide communications market and the growing demand for related equipment  numerous manufacturers such as the company have emerged to offer products for these markets in competition with traditional communications equipment suppliers 
competition could further increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines or upgrade existing products to accommodate new technologies and features 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have a longer operating history and greater technical  manufacturing  financial and marketing resources than the company and  as a result  may be able to adapt more quickly or devote greater resources to changing technological requirements  customer demands and market trends 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that its ability to compete successfully depends upon elements both within and outside its control  including successful and timely development of new products and manufacturing processes  product performance and quality  manufacturing yields and product availability  customer services  pricing  industry trends and general economic trends 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully as to these factors 
see see business mitel communications systems competition and mitel semiconductor competition 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of its key technical and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the development of mixed signal products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense 
the loss of the services of the company s employees or the company s failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not have any employment agreements with its employees 
intellectual property protection the company s success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on its ability to protect its intellectual property 
the company relies primarily on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect its proprietary technologies and processes 
there can be no assurance that such measures will provide meaningful protection for the company s proprietary technologies and processes 
the company has been issued many patents  principally in the united states  canada and the united kingdom  and has filed numerous patent applications in such jurisdictions 
there can be no assurance that any patent will issue from these applications or future applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any existing or future patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that any right granted thereunder would provide meaningful protection or a competitive advantage to the company 
the failure of any patents to provide protection to the company s technology would make it easier for the company s competitors to offer similar products 
the company also generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and strategic partners and generally controls access to and distribution of its documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s products  services or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around the company s patents 
in addition  effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
certain of the company s customers have entered into agreements with the company pursuant to which such customers have the right to use the company s proprietary technology in the event the company defaults in its contractual obligations  including product supply obligations  and fails to cure the default within a specified period of time 
moreover  the company often incorporates the intellectual property of its strategic customers into its design and the company has certain obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of such intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to prevent misappropriation or infringement of the intellectual property of the company or its customers will be successful 
moreover  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect the company s trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  including its customers 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of the company s resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property claims the segment of the telecommunications market that includes the company s products has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
as is common in the telecommunications industry  the company has been in the past and may in the future be notified of claims that its products or services are subject to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties 
although the company attempts to ensure that its products and processes do not infringe such third party patents or proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against the company 
periodically  the company negotiates with third parties to establish patent license or cross license agreements 
there can be no assurance that current or future negotiations will result in the company obtaining a license on satisfactory terms or at all 
moreover  license agreements with third parties may not include all intellectual property rights that may be issued to or owned by the licensors and thus future disputes with these companies are possible 
in the event an intellectual property dispute is not settled through a license  litigation could result 
any litigation or interference proceedings could result in substantial expense to the company and significant diversion of effort by the company s technical and managerial personnel 
an adverse determination in such litigation or proceeding could prevent the company from making  using or selling certain of its products and subject the company to damage assessments  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions since  the company has made strategic acquisitions 
in the future  the company may make further strategic acquisitions and investments or enter into joint ventures or strategic alliances with other companies 
such transactions entail many risks  including the following inability to integrate successfully such companies personnel and businesses  inability to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value associated with such transactions  diversion of management s attention and disruption of the company s ongoing business  inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel  inability to establish and maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of the integration of new personnel 
in addition  future acquisitions or investments by the company may result in the issuance of additional equity or debt securities  significant borrowings  significant one time write offs and the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets 
failure to avoid these or other risks associated with such business combinations  investments  joint ventures or strategic alliances could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
significant international operations approximately of the company s sales in fiscal were derived from sales in markets outside canada and outside north america 
the company expects sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of total sales 
the company operates five manufacturing facilities as well as sales and technical support service centers in europe and asia 
certain risks are inherent in international operations  including exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  political and economic conditions  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  future import and export restrictions  difficulties in staffing and managing operations  difficulties in collecting receivables and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that the above factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
foreign exchange and interest rate exposure and concentration of credit risk because substantial portions of the company s sales  costs of sales and other expenses are denominated in us dollars  us pounds sterling and several other currencies  the company s results of operations are subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations of those currencies relative to the canadian dollar 
changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which the company and its competitors sell their products in the same markets 
the company uses financial instruments  principally forward exchange contracts  in its management of foreign currency exposures on estimated net foreign currency cash requirements and on certain significant transactions  generally over the ensuing to months 
all foreign exchange contracts are marked to market and the resulting gains and losses are deferred and included in the measurement of the related transactions when they occur 
these contracts primarily require the company to purchase and sell certain foreign currencies with or for canadian dollars at contractual rates 
a substantial amount of the company s long term debt is subject to variable interest rates 
the company uses interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate risk 
payments and receipts under interest rate swap contracts are recognized as adjustments to interest expense on a basis that matches them with the related fluctuations in the interest receipts and payments under floating financial assets and liabilities 
several major financial institutions are counterparties to the company s financial instruments 
it is the company s practice to monitor the financial standing of the counterparties and limit the amount of exposure to any one institution 
the company may be exposed to a credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties of these contracts 
with respect to accounts receivable  concentration of credit risk is limited due to the diverse areas covered by the company s operations 
the company has credit evaluation  approval and monitoring processes intended to mitigate potential credit risks 
anticipated bad debt loss has been provided for in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s operations could be adversely affected if it is unable to guard against currency  interest and credit risks in the future 
there can be no assurance that foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations or credit risk will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental regulations the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or other hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing process 
although the company believes that it has complied with these laws  rules and regulations in all material respects and to date has not been required to take any action to correct any noncompliance  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
such regulations could require the company to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
any failure by the company to control the use  disposal or storage of or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject the company to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
regulatory requirements the sale of certain of the company s systems products may be affected by governmental regulatory policies  the imposition of carrier tariffs and taxation of telecommunications services 
these policies are under continuous review and are subject to change 
regulatory authorities may prohibit sales of products that fail to comply with these regulations until the company makes appropriate modifications 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining or maintaining the necessary regulatory approvals for its products and its failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the united states  regulatory policies are likely to have a significant impact on the competitive environment in which the company operates 
the telecommunications act of and associated regulatory developments will eliminate or modify many regulatory restrictions in the telecommunications market 
deregulation may facilitate the increasingly competitive offerings by communications services providers 
in addition  rbocs are now permitted to manufacture and sell telecommunications equipment under certain conditions 
given the substantial resources and large customer base of the rbocs  the company could face competition from these companies should they satisfy these conditions and elect to manufacture networking products

on january   mitel completed the sale of its lincoln automotive and power business segment lincoln for total consideration of the sale concluded a formal plan announced on april   to dispose of this segment as part of mitel s efforts to focus on its core communications business 
as a result of the sale  the company recorded additional after tax provisions of as a loss from discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal results of operations mitel is a global provider of converging voice and data systems and applications  and specialty semiconductors for the communications industry 
mitel operates through two reportable business segments mitel communications systems systems and mitel semiconductor semiconductor 
mitel sells its products through both direct and indirect channels of distribution 
factors affecting the choice of distribution include end customer type  the level of product complexity and integration requirements  the stage of product introduction  geographic presence and location of markets  and volume levels 
mitel communications systems provides enterprises with voice and data communications systems  complete private networks  including remote teleworking solutions  unified messaging and call center applications  and cti systems and applications 
it also supplies competitive carriers with public network access products 
mitel semiconductor specializes in connectivity solutions for the communications and medical industries with a product range that includes components for both wired and wireless networks  microelectronics for enabling the convergence of voice and data  optoelectronic devices for high speed internet systems  and application specific integrated circuits asics for medical applications such as pacemakers and hearing aids 
millions cdn consolidated revenue   systems segment revenue semiconductor segment revenue net income from continuing operations net income per common share from continuing operations net income net income per common share adjusted net income adjusted net income per common share mitel s total revenue grew by from fiscal by business group  semiconductor revenue from continuing operations grew by and systems revenue was up from the previous year 
the semiconductor growth rate was mainly attributable to sales of wan internetworking products  stimulated by increased demand for high speed networking systems 
higher sales volumes of pbx systems and telephone sets in north america and alternative network access products in europe drove the systems revenue growth 
adjusted net income excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles  special charges net  non cash debt issue and other costs expensed on an early partial debt repayment  and discontinued operations 
although not a substitute for net income or net income per common share  adjusted net income and adjusted net income per common share are used by management as a supplementary measure to assess financial performance 
net income net income was higher in fiscal than in fiscal by  or per share 
this increase was primarily due to revenue growth and higher gross profits  principally in semiconductor  and to lower interest expense due to the scheduled and mandatory debt repayments made against the syndicated term loans 
fiscal s results also included a net charge to rationalize certain systems operations 
the positive factors in fiscal were partially offset by higher intangible asset amortization of as a result of revisions to the estimated useful lives of those assets made in the fourth quarter of fiscal and to a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal adjusted net income adjusted net income was higher in fiscal than in fiscal by  or per share  representing a year over year growth rate of 
the increase in adjusted net income primarily reflected increases in semiconductor revenues and gross margins  partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal compared with fiscal unless otherwise noted  the following discussion pertains to mitel s continuing operations 
revenue business segment review mitel communications systems millions cdn systems revenue as a percent of total revenue systems revenue grew by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal the growth was due to increased sales volumes of sx and sx systems  including the associated pull through of system sets  primarily in north america  and to increased demand for mitel s network access solutions products in europe 
the improvement was partially offset by lower european system sales to large accounts that were adversely affected in part by the year concerns 
fiscal north american channel sales increased by compared with fiscal the us indirect channel sales benefited from increased demand by the small to medium sized business segment for mitel s sx ml and sx el switches 
us direct channel sales benefited from increased installations of new systems as well as from upgrades in the existing customer base 
based on market research provided by phillips infotech  a new jersey based market research firm  mitel s north american market share  based on pbx line shipments  improved to in calendar from in calendar this placed mitel third overall in the north american pbx line market 
voice messaging product sales were flat in this region compared with last year as a result of delayed orders  partly due to year concerns and a resulting focus by customers on core business systems instead of improved features and functionality 
the decline in european system sales and service revenue compared with fiscal was primarily the result of delayed orders in the latter half of the fiscal year in light of the market s year concerns and the lingering effects into the fourth quarter 
the lower sales were partially offset by continued higher demand for mitel s alternative network access products 
systems sales into the asia pacific region were lower due to a reduced focus by mitel on competing in that region for enterprise communications systems 
fiscal systems segment operating income improved to  or by over fiscal  primarily as a result of improved voice systems margins and sales channel efficiencies 
fiscal systems revenue growth of compared with fiscal was due to increased demand for alternative network access products  higher sx and sx sales through the us indirect channel  and additional revenues from the advanced messaging and isdn pbx businesses acquired in the first quarter of fiscal mitel semiconductor millions cdn semiconductor revenue as a percent of total revenue through fiscal  mitel continued to consolidate and rationalize its product line to focus on areas that management believes will result in high growth and profitability 
overall  semiconductor revenue from continuing operations in fiscal increased by from fiscal  principally due to stronger wan internetworking and wireless access sales  partially offset by lower home gateway and medical sales 
the significant increase in wan internetworking sales occurred primarily in the united states 
the increase in wireless access sales was driven by growth across all regions 
management believes that home gateway and medical sales will improve in fiscal based in part on a strengthened order backlog at year end 
during fiscal  as part of a strategic plan to consolidate capacity levels and achieve better manufacturing utilization  mitel implemented a plan to transfer all semiconductor cmos manufacturing operations from jarfalla  sweden  to plymouth  uk the transfer resulted in improved semiconductor manufacturing capacity 
since the transfer  the swedish operation has been operating as an ic fabless facility focused on the design  marketing and sales of asics and as a manufacturer and marketer of optoelectronic devices 
certain capital investments were made during fiscal to increase overall semiconductor production capacity  principally for wireless and new media products  to meet the requirements of the growing semiconductor backlog 
fiscal semiconductor segment operating income improved to  or by over fiscal  primarily as a result of an improved product portfolio mix and higher manufacturing utilization 
fiscal semiconductor revenue increased over fiscal by as a result of increased demand for the company s ics and thick film hybrid products  primarily in the us  and the effects of consolidating the former plessey semiconductor group for a full year 
geographic revenues revenue during the last three fiscal years  based on the geographic location of mitel s customers  was distributed as follows millions cdn united states europe asia pacific canada other regions for the year ended march   the net movement in exchange rates from fiscal adversely affected total revenue by primarily as a result of changes in the uk pound sterling and uk dollar exchange rates 
fiscal revenue was favorably affected by as a result of changes in the uk pound sterling and uk dollar exchange rates 
united states sales into the united states increased by in fiscal over fiscal the increase was principally due to higher sales of sx systems and associated sets  and increased installation of new systems and upgrades in the existing customer base 
higher semiconductor revenue also contributed to the growth in this region  primarily due to higher wan internetworking and wireless sales 
sales increased by in the united states in fiscal over fiscal  principally due to the systems business 
higher sales of sx and associated sets  and the effects of consolidating sales resulting from the may acquisition of centigram communications corporation s customer premises equipment  drove most of the increase 
europe european sales increased by in fiscal over fiscal due to higher sales of alternative network access products to long distance carriers and stronger sales of semiconductors 
fiscal revenue into europe increased by over fiscal due to the effects of including a full year of the former plessey group s results 
canada canadian sales increased by in fiscal over fiscal as a result of increased pbx market share driven by stronger sales of sx and sx systems and higher semiconductor sales 
according to research by phillips infotech  mitel was the number one pbx supplier in canada in the under  line segment in calendar  capturing of that market segment 
mitel gained market share points  up from in calendar the sales increase in canada from fiscal to fiscal was on higher semiconductor sales from the former plessey operations and to higher sales of sx systems and sets in the systems group 
asia pacific asia pacific sales decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of reduced focus on this segment of the enterprise communications systems market 
fiscal revenue in the asia pacific region increased by  principally due to the effects of including a full year of the former plessey group s results 
other regions sales into other regions decreased by in fiscal compared with fiscal the decrease was principally due to reduced semiconductor sales 
fiscal s increase of in sales into other regions over fiscal was due to the effects of consolidating plessey for a full year 
gross margin millions cdn gross margin as a percent of revenue the higher fiscal gross margin was principally attributable to a favorable semiconductor sales mix and positive manufacturing variances resulting from improved semiconductor manufacturing utilization and to the positive impacts of higher sales volumes of voice systems and network access products 
gross margin in fiscal decreased relative to fiscal by percentage points 
the negative impact resulted mainly from increased amortization expense  reduced margins in some products  and certain unfavorable manufacturing variances in semiconductor 
operating expenses selling and administrative s a millions cdn s a expenses as a percent of revenue s a expenses increased as a percentage of sales in fiscal over the previous year  primarily due to mitel s continued investments in marketing new advanced messaging applications  as well as developing new channels in europe for the isdn pbx products 
fiscal s a expenses decreased as a percentage of sales from fiscal  primarily due to strong revenue growth and the inclusion of the former plessey operations  where s a expenses as a percentage of sales were lower than mitel s historical average 
the improvement was partially offset by the effects of consolidating the recently acquired advanced messaging and isdn pbx businesses 
research and development r d millions cdn r d expenses as a percent of revenue fiscal r d expenses were net of  in r d government assistance  including investment tax credits 
the r d focus in systems is directed to introducing new internet protocol based ip voice systems and peripherals for the enterprise network and to integrating advanced messaging applications into its product portfolio 
r d is also ensuring a migration path for mitel legacy systems to the new ip architecture 
in semiconductor  investments are being made in high growth areas such as wan internetworking  optoelectronics and medical devices 
special charges net during the fourth quarter of fiscal  mitel recorded a net pre tax special charge of  including actions to rationalize certain aspects of the systems group  net of a gain arising from the sale of certain non strategic technology and other assets 
the systems actions reflected efforts to streamline north american and european sales channels by transfering the network access product manufacturing operations from north america to the united kingdom  where the majority of the sales are generated 
also included in the charge was the cost of severance and related benefits  with the majority of the reduction taking place in the north american and asia pacific regions 
approximately people were terminated as part of this rationalization program that was completed during the year  resulting in a nil restructuring provision balance at march  amortization of acquired intangibles amortization of acquired intangibles increased in fiscal to from in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the estimated useful life of acquired intangibles was reduced to two years from an average of to years to better reflect the estimated period of advantage achieved by mitel s recent acquisitions  and to be in line with evolving industry practices 
the revision to the estimated useful life of acquired intangibles accounted for the total increase 
interest income interest income was for the year ended march   as compared with in fiscal and in fiscal the increase over fiscal was due to higher average cash balances on hand 
interest expense interest expense was for fiscal  compared with and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense was principally attributable to repayments on the syndicated term loans 
the fiscal increase resulted from the term loans incurred by mitel on february   in connection with the plessey acquistion 
income taxes income tax expense for fiscal was  compared with and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the effective income tax rate  as a percentage of pre tax income from continuing operations and before the effect of amortization of acquired intangibles  was  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increased effective tax rate in fiscal was mainly due to higher taxable income in canada and the favorable impact in fiscal of certain permanent differences associated with european operations 
the fiscal effective tax rate was lower than in fiscal due to lower taxes in canada  resulting from higher interest costs related to the term loans and to tax recoveries in europe 
backlog millions cdn backlog as orders are frequently booked and shipped within the same fiscal month  order backlog is not necessarily indicative of a sales outlook for the month  quarter or year 
this is most true for systems  since manufacturing lead times for semiconductor products are generally longer because of the nature of the production process 
at march   order backlog was  up from at march  the increase in backlog was attributable to higher orders arising from growing demand for semiconductor products related to internet and broadband connectivity 
most of the backlog is scheduled for delivery in the next months 
compared with fiscal  the decrease in backlog of from continuing operations at the end of fiscal was attributable to a decrease in semiconductor orders  arising partly from a reduction in order lead times 
liquidity and capital resources mitel had cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances of at march   compared with at march  all of the march   cash balance was held in either cash or highly liquid cash equivalents 
the increase of was mainly due to cash flow provided by operating activities  partially offset by fixed asset additions and the cost of a common share repurchase program 
operating activities cash flow from operations before working capital changes amounted to during fiscal  compared with in fiscal since march   mitel s working capital  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  decreased by  primarily due to lower receivables as a result of strong collections in the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by payments made against the special charges and the discontinued operations provisions 
inventory levels remained flat compared to last year 
mitel maintains a minimum of critical inventory to ensure continuity of supply for its manufacturing requirements 
most of the security supply inventory is carried at mitel s semiconductor plants 
investing activities fixed asset and other additions were during fiscal  compared with in the previous year  excluding additions of and financed by capital lease for the two respective periods 
the additions were primarily related to continuing improvements to mitel s information technology resources  as well as semiconductor manufacturing capacity and technology enhancements 
the fiscal technology enhancements included the implementation of a global erp software system 
the project was completed on schedule on april   when the whole of the company moved to the new erp platform 
management believes this advanced information system will significantly improve the business tools supporting sales and order administration  procurement  manufacturing and financial reporting 
in addition  the new system s infrastructure enables the company to prepare for upcoming e commerce and business to business initiatives 
the total project costs capitalized in fiscal  including hardware costs and costs to configure the software  amounted to approximately in the fourth quarter of fiscal  mitel received cash proceeds of related to the sale of the lincoln business 
financing activities mitel has two term loans  respectively the axelssm series b loan and the tranche a term loan  that were entered into on february   with a syndicate of banks led by goldman  sachs credit partners lp as the syndication agent and the canadian imperial bank of commerce as the administrative agent 
the term loans bear interest at a variable interest rate based on the lower of a defined base rate or the london inter bank offer rate libor plus a premium 
mitel entered into an interest rate swap to fix the base interest rate on a portion of each of the term loans 
the interest rate swap is considered to be an effective hedge of the variable interest rates on the term loans 
mitel is subject to certain restrictive covenants and commitments and is required to maintain certain financial ratios for the purpose of ensuring the company s ability to meet its obligations under the credit agreement 
the term loans are subject to mandatory prepayments out of certain insurance proceeds  defined excess cash flow generated by mitel  and the proceeds of certain asset sales other than inventory  equity offerings or debt issuances by mitel 
mandatory prepayments range from to of the applicable net cash proceeds and would be paid on a pro rata basis between the axels series bond tranche a term loan subject to certain constraints toward the tranche a term loans 
management believes mitel is in compliance with the obligations and restrictive covenants under the credit agreement 
the principal of the axels series b loan is payable in four equal quarterly installments commencing march the principal of the tranche a term loan will be fully repaid in june as a result of a mandatory prepayment required to be made from mitel s defined excess cash flow in fiscal long term debt decreased due to scheduled repayments of against the syndicated term loans 
as a result of the lincoln sale  mitel made a mandatory prepayment of us against the syndicated term loans on january  on june   mitel announced its intention to make a normal course issuer bid for up to  common shares of  common shares issued and outstanding at may  
these purchases took place on the open market through the stock exchanges of toronto and montreal commencing on june   pursuant to the normal course issuer bid filed with these exchanges 
as at march    common shares were purchased and canceled for cash consideration of  including costs to acquire the shares 
as at march   mitel s capitalization consisted of debt  preferred equity and common equity 
this compares with debt  preferred equity and common equity at the end of fiscal in addition to cash and cash equivalent balances of as at march   mitel has an unused revolving credit facility of approximately us 
in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement  the maximum amount of us available under the revolving credit facility will be reduced by us in june as a result of the mandatory prepayment triggered by mitel s achievement of defined excess cash flow in fiscal mandatory prepayments that would exceed contractual limitations on prepayments of the axels series b loan are instead applied to reduce permanently the revolving loan commitments under the credit agreement 
management believes mitel is in a position to meet all foreseeable business cash requirements and debt service from its cash balances on hand  existing financing facilities and cash flow from operations 
year the following statements constitute a year readiness disclosure as that term is defined in the year information and readiness disclosure act p 
l signed into law by us president clinton on october  the year challenge was the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
this practice resulted in the possibility that the company s internal computer systems and products that have date sensitive software could recognize a date that uses as rather than the year if mitel s internal computer systems misread the year date  system failures or miscalculations could cause disruptions of operations  including a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business operations 
a dedicated year program management office pmo was established in february to address compliance both externally  by mitel s customers and suppliers  and internally  with respect to mitel s business processes 
these internal processes include network and communications infrastructure  business software applications  manufacturing  distribution  facilities management  product development  sales  finance and human resources 
mitel experienced no major issues related to the transition to january  preparations were made for the february  rollover to address potential problems that would arise due to the century leap year date 
though no year related issues were encountered over the february  rollover  internal systems will continue to be monitored for any unlikely disruptions 
the contingency plans that were developed for use in the event of year related failures will be maintained and generalized for ongoing business use 
the year pmo closed on march  the final phase of mitel s formal year program was the collection and long term retention of year related due diligence documentation 
guidelines were developed to assist mitel in its standard collection and retention of relevant documentation on a worldwide basis 
due diligence will be maintained to ensure that business continues as usual 
as part of mitel s year internal readiness program  compliance of internal systems was addressed by assessing the company s requirements for business continuation 
through thorough inventory assessment  testing and renovation of internal information systems equipment  mitel safe guarded its mission critical systems against major internal year related failures 
in addition  risk assessments were performed  and contingency plans were developed for technical systems  as well as for business processes 
year readiness drills were conducted at each corporate location to further test and fine tune contingency plans 
mitel also implemented a year vendor management program and a year distributor management program  which required that all suppliers and distributors be evaluated and ranked upon criticality to the business 
those suppliers and distributors determined to be most critical to the business were given highest priority  and contingency plans were developed for use in the event that critical supplies could not be delivered to mitel or regular distribution channels were not available 
mitel also completed comprehensive tests on customer premises equipment and semiconductor component products manufactured and sold to customers  including current and certain discontinued business telephone systems pbxs  peripheral components and applications 
the majority of these products were classified as year compliant or as having compliant versions 
the total incremental direct cost of the year internal readiness program amounted to and was funded through operating cash flows 
the program costs were primarily attributable to the purchase of new software and equipment and do not include estimates for potential litigation 
other asia pacific economic risk the asia pacific region encountered unstable local economies and significant devaluation in its currencies during fiscal and through most of fiscal this region represented of mitel s revenue from continuing operations for the year ended march   and of revenue from continuing operations in fiscal the majority of the asia pacific sales relate to semiconductor operations 
asia pacific receivables  net of reserves  were approximately of mitel s total assets as at march  to the extent that the asia pacific region grows in importance to mitel  or that the factors affecting the region begin to adversely affect customers in other locations  mitel s business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
foreign currency translation management periodically evaluates the financial and operational independence of its foreign operations and the resulting accounting classification of the foreign subsidiaries as self sustaining enterprises 
should a foreign subsidiary cease to be classified as self sustaining  then translation gains or losses on consolidating the foreign subsidiary s financial statements would be charged to operating income instead of a separate component of shareholders equity 
at march   the translation account was in a debit position of  representing a decrease of from the end of fiscal the decrease was due to a stronger canadian dollar as measured against other currencies  principally the uk pound sterling and the uk dollar 
european union and the euro on january   of member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro will trade on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
the conversion to the euro eliminates currency exchange rate risk between the member countries 
mitel s operating subsidiaries that are affected by the euro conversion have established plans to address the issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include the need to adapt computer and financial systems  competitive impacts of cross border price transparency  and recalculating currency risk 
mitel does not expect any required system conversion costs to be material due to the existing ability to transact in multiple currencies 
due to significant uncertainties  mitel cannot reasonably estimate the effects one common currency will have on pricing and the resulting impact  if any  on mitel s financial condition or its results of operations 
forward looking statements certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis constitute forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of mitel  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such risks  uncertainties and assumptions include the following general economic and business conditions  demographic changes  import protection and regulation  rapid technology development and changes  timing of product introductions  the mix of products services  industry competition  industry capacity and other industry trends  and the ability of mitel to attract and retain key employees

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact mitel s financial statements due to adverse changes in financial markets 
mitel is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to manage these risks  mitel uses certain derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  forward contracts and other derivative instruments from time to time  that have been authorized pursuant to board approved policies and procedures 
mitel does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
mitel currently uses forward contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the most significant foreign exchange exposures for mitel relate to the us dollar  us pound sterling and the euro 
at march   there were unrealized gains of on the forward contracts and unrealized losses of and on the forward and option contracts  respectively 
these unrealized gains and losses are calculated as the difference between the actual contract rates and the applicable current market rates that would be used if the foreign exchange contracts were unwound on march  additional potential losses in the net fair value of these contracts  assuming a appreciation in the us dollar against all currencies at march   would have been approximately because these contracts are entered into for hedging purposes  management believes that these potential losses would be largely offset by gains on the underlying exposures from firmly committed or anticipated transactions 
interest rate swaps are used to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and also to lower overall borrowing costs 
mitel s main exposure to interest rate risk relates to its us dollar denominated long term debt 
mitel monitors its interest rate risk on the basis of changes in fair value 
assuming a percentage point rise in us interest rates at march   the potential loss in the net fair value of the interest rate swap and the underlying hedged debt would be over the life of the debt 
under the same assumption  the potential loss in the net change in fair value of unhedged debt would have been immaterial because substantially all of the us dollar denominated long term debt is hedged 
in accordance with mitel policy  cash equivalent and short term investment balances consist primarily of high grade money market instruments with original maturity dates of less than one year 
the estimated potential losses discussed previously assume the occurrence of certain adverse market conditions 
these calculations do not consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors and do not represent projected losses in fair value that mitel expects to incur 
future impacts would be based on actual developments in global financial markets 
management does not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest and foreign exchange rate risks in the near future
