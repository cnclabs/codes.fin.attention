item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations net sales for fiscal year were  representing a increase in sales over the  recorded in fiscal year fiscal year net sales represented a increase in net sales over the  recorded in fiscal year increases in unit and dollar sales for the company s obstructive sleep apnea therapy devices the company s largest product line and oxygen concentrator devices  as well as increases in the sales of masks and other accessories  helped to drive the increase in sales for the current fiscal year  offset by decreases in unit and dollar sales of the company s non invasive ventilatory support products for home use 
these product lines  along with ventilation devices and oxygen systems  comprise the major part of the company s homecare division established as part of the july restructuring plan 
sales of the company s hospital products also increased during the current fiscal year  including unit and dollar increases for the company s vision tm and esprit r ventilators 
the fiscal year to fiscal year increase was due primarily to increases in unit and dollar sales of the company s obstructive sleep apnea therapy products  non invasive ventilatory support products for hospital use  and oxygen concentrator products  offset by decreases in unit and dollar sales of the company s non invasive ventilatory support products for home use 
sales for the second half of fiscal year and all of fiscal years and were adversely impacted by decreases in sales of the company s non invasive ventilatory support products for use in the home compared to prior year levels 
these sales decreases were caused at first by uncertainty in the market concerning government insurance coverage guidelines for the home use of these products in the united states and the corresponding reduction in purchases of these units by the company s dealer customers pending resolution of the coverage guidelines 
government policymakers issued a draft coverage policy for non invasive ventilation in july that was more restrictive than had been expected 
the company  along with trade and medical associations  other device manufacturers  and homecare dealers  filed formal comments as permitted with the policy makers indicating disagreement with the draft coverage policy 
in may  a revised set of coverage guidelines was issued for implementation on october  while several restrictive provisions of the july draft guidelines were removed and potential changes in reimbursement categories were delayed  the company believed that these revised guidelines were still overly restrictive relative to patient qualification and administratively burdensome for clinicians and healthcare providers 
as a result  the company continued to work with the government policy makers and congress to resolve the remaining issues 
several favorable modifications were made to the guidelines  and final guidelines reflecting these modifications were implemented effective october  the company believes that these guidelines are still overly restrictive relative to patient qualification and administratively burdensome and is continuing to work with government policy makers on these issues 
the uncertainty in the market regarding these guidelines and their implementation was particularly significant during fiscal year as the planned implementation date approached and passed  and the company s sales for these products were adversely affected 
the company believes that while the guidelines as implemented are overly restrictive  there is benefit to having certainty in the market regarding coverage for these products and as a result there are opportunities for increased unit sales of non invasive ventilatory support products 
however  selling prices for such units may come under pressure and there may be mix shifts to units with lower average selling prices because of certain patient qualification tests that are required under the guidelines 
while the company is working closely with its dealer customers to develop strategies to reach the appropriate patient population in the context of these new guidelines  it cannot predict with certainty the exact impact the new guidelines will have 
for the fiscal year ended june   sales of non invasive ventilatory support units for home use in the united states accounted for approximately three percent of total sales  compared to eight percent in fiscal year and twelve percent in fiscal year in addition  the company is also experiencing more general challenges in its marketplace due to the january reductions in medicare reimbursement for oxygen therapy  which adversely affected many of the company s dealer customers 
also affecting sales for the current fiscal year was a decrease in sales compared to fiscal year resulting from the impact of the company s may decision to change its method of distribution in germany from direct patient sales to sales through a distributor 
as a result of this change  sales decreased in the year to year comparison by approximately  due to the foregone distributor margin 
excluding this foregone distributor margin  sales in germany increased for the current fiscal year 
operating expenses in germany were reduced to help offset this foregone dealer margin 
the company s gross profit  excluding the impact of restructuring  was of net sales for fiscal year as compared to and of net sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit percentage for fiscal year compared to the prior year was primarily due to the foregone dealer margin described above  a shift in sales mix and  to a lesser extent  increased costs related to the company s distribution and manufacturing restructuring efforts 
the decrease in the gross margin percentage for fiscal year was due primarily to reductions in gross margin in the fourth quarter of that year caused by the change in distribution method for sales in germany  increased manufacturing overhead expenses  and sales mix 
general and administrative expenses  including additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts  were  of net sales for fiscal year   of net sales for fiscal year  and  of net sales for fiscal year the fiscal year general and administrative expenses includes a special addition to the allowance for doubtful accounts of  of net sales related to a previously disclosed filing by one of the company s major customers under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the company s total balance due from the customer at the date of the chapter filing was approximately  the fiscal year total shown above includes a special addition of  of net sales to the company s allowance for doubtful accounts 
this special addition was made primarily to address accounts receivable remaining uncollected that were generated by healthdyne technologies  inc healthdyne prior to its merger with the company in february this addition was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a change in previous estimates resulting from slow collections  aging deterioration  and issues affecting customers related to accounts that management expected to collect during fiscal year the remaining increases in expenses for the periods presented were due primarily to increased information technology department expenses  including depreciation expense on sap hardware and software  legal fees  and other administrative expenses 
partially offsetting these increases in expenses in fiscal year were lower operating expenses due to the company s restructuring efforts and decreased expenses in germany as a result of the company s may decision to reduce its direct sales operation in that country as described above 
increased expenses for fiscal year were partially offset by cost reductions that the company obtained since the february merger with healthdyne 
sales  marketing and commission expenses were  of net sales for fiscal year as compared to  of net sales for fiscal year and  of net sales for fiscal year the increase in absolute dollars of expense for the current fiscal year were due primarily to increased expenses driven by increased sales and activity levels in the company s homecare and hospital product lines  partially offset by lower operating expenses due to the company s restructuring efforts and decreased operating expenses in germany as a result of the company s may decision to reduce its direct sales operation in that country as discussed above 
the decrease in these expenses from fiscal year to fiscal year was due primarily to the cost reductions that the company achieved since the february merger with healthdyne 
see notes k and n to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding this merger 
research and development expenses were  of net sales for fiscal year as compared to  of net sales for fiscal year and  of net sales for fiscal year the increase in absolute dollars of expense for the current fiscal year was due primarily to the timing of various research and development projects
