item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company participates in floor plan arrangements with several major third party lenders on behalf of its dealers  most of who have financing arrangements with more than one lender 
except as described above  or where it has a direct repurchase agreement with a dealer  the company is under no material obligation to repurchase boats from its dealers 
from time to time the company will voluntarily repurchase a boat for the convenience of the dealer or for another dealer who needs a particular model not readily available from the factory 
the marketing of boats to retail customers is primarily the responsibility of the dealer  whose efforts are supplemented by the company through advertising in boating magazines  participation in regional  national  and international boat shows  and on tnn  espn  and speed vision 
additionally  in order to further promote its products over the years  the company has developed racing programs to participate in the major classes of offshore powerboat races  many of which are regularly televised on networks such as espn  tnn and speed vision 
additionally  fountain single  twin and triple engine racing boats continue to hold their respective world speed records 
the result of these racing victories and world speed records has established the company s products as the highest performing and safest designed offshore boats 
the company believes that the favorable publicity generated by these performance programs contributes to its sales volume 
the company founder and ceo  reggie fountain  has won numerous races in both factory and customer boats  he has also set numerous speed records in both factory and customer boats 
these fountain race boats were  in general  very successful in the various racing circuits in which they competed 
the company constructed two race boats during fiscal and implemented a racing program during fiscal  of which a major engine manufacturer was a sponsor 
in fiscal  the company completed the structure of its racing program with a third boat and captured several world speed records through the summer of calendar with the th victory completed by reggie fountain in new york city in september  as part of the marketing program for its line of sport fishing boats  the company sponsors several outstanding sport fishermen in the southern kingfish association circuit 
this competitive circuit sanctions king mackerel tournaments throughout the atlantic and gulf coast from north carolina to texas 
in fiscal  the company s boats and sponsored fishermen dominated this circuit by winning of the top spots 
one fountain fisherman  clayton kirby was named angler of the year and finished in first place 
since fiscal  the fountain fishing team has continued to dominate the ska circuit winning many of the top spots 
fountain fishermen have won the coveted angler of the year title of the last years 
the ska tournaments are held weekly and attract from entrants with prize money in excess of  the fountain fishing teams winning records have given our sport fishing boats favorable exposure to serious sport fishermen  in particular with respect to the superior performance of fountain s fishing boat line 
sales order backlog 
the sales order backlog typically builds to approximately boats during the august october dealer allocation period having an estimated sales value of  all of the backlog is generally shipped within months 
during the last year  the company s performance boats increased in sales value to a greater degree than fishing boats  which increased the overall average unit boat price 
in addition  the sale of the first supercruiser contributed to a substantial per boat increase 
the company s fall dealer allocation program is designed to promote early replenishment of the stock in dealer inventories depleted throughout the prime spring and summer selling seasons 
product warranty 
the company warrants its boats against defects in material and workmanship for a period of three years 
the engine manufacturer warrants engines included in the boats 
warranty expenses of  or of sales were incurred in fiscal and were charged off against net income 
a reserve for warranty expenses estimated to be incurred in future years had been recorded and amounted to  at june  for  warranty costs were  or percent of sales 
warranty costs as a percentage of sales are among the lowest in the marine industry thereby reflecting the company s superior construction of its boats 
competition 
competition within the powerboat manufacturing industry is intense 
while the high performance sports boat market comprises only a small segment of all boats manufactured  the higher prices commanded by these boats make it a significant market in terms of total dollars spent 
the manufacturers that compete directly with the company in its market segment include wellcraft division of genmar industries  inc formula  a division of thunderbird products corporation baja boats  a division of brunswick corporation cigarette racing team  inc donzi  american marine holdings the company believes that in its market segment  speed  performance  quality  image  and safety are the main competitive factors  with styling and price being somewhat lesser considerations 
the market for fishing boats is much larger than the one for sport boats  but there are many more fishing boat manufacturers than there are sport boat manufacturers 
the company believes that its current owners  many of whom have purchased multiple and increasingly larger boats from the company regenerate a ready waiting market for its expansion into the cruiser and yacht market

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as described more fully below at business environment  more than half of the company s shipments to dealers were financed through so called floor plan arrangements with third party lenders pursuant to which the company may be required to repurchase boats repossessed by the lenders if the dealer defaults under his credit arrangement 
the balance of shipments was cod or payment prior to shipment 
the company has developed criteria for determining whether a shipment should be recorded as a sale or as a deferred sale a balance sheet liability 
the criteria for recording a sale are that the boat has been completed and shipped to a customer  that title and all other incidents of ownership have passed to the customer  and that there is no direct commitment to repurchase the boat or to pay floor plan interest beyond the normal sales program terms 
this is the method of sales recognition believed to be in use by most boat manufacturers 
at june    and  there were no commitments to dealers to pay the interest on floor plan financed boats in excess of the time period specified in the company s written sales program and there were no direct repurchase agreements 
there were no deferred sales or cost of sales estimated at june    and the company has a contingent liability to repurchase boats where it participates in the floor plan financing made available to its dealers by third party finance companies 
sales to participating dealers are approved by the respective finance companies 
if a participating dealer does not satisfy its obligation to the lender and the boat is subsequently repossessed by the lender  then the company may be required to repurchase the boat 
the company had a contingent liability of approximately  and  at june  and for the shipment of boats  which remained uncollected by the finance companies at those dates 
additionally  at june  and  the company had recorded reserves of  and  which represent losses which may be reasonably expected to be incurred on boat repurchases in future years 
business environment 
the company s sales have continued to increase each year 
sales for were  up from fiscal the sales volume increase for fiscal was in line with the overall recreational boating industry 
plant utilization stands at about until the yacht and the new cruiser and fishboat product lines are in full production 
sales for fiscal were  up more than from sales for fiscal sales for fiscal were  in fiscal  the company continued to advertise and market aggressively 
management believes that the company s advertising  marketing  racing  and tournament fishing programs  as well as its reputation as the builder of the highest quality  best performing  and safest high performance boats in the industry  all contributed to maintaining our performance market share 
typically  each dealer s floor plan credit facilities are secured by the dealer s inventory  and perhaps  other personal and real property 
in connection with the dealers floor plan arrangements  the company as well as substantially all other major manufacturers has agreed in most instances to repurchase  under certain circumstances  any of its boats which a lender repossesses from a dealer and returns to the company 
in the event that a dealer defaults under its credit line  the lender may invoke the manufacturers repurchase agreements with respect to that dealer 
in that event  all repurchase agreements of all manufacturers supplying a defaulting dealer are generally invoked regardless of the boat or boats with respect to which the dealer has defaulted 
except where there is a direct repurchase agreement with the customer  the company is under no obligation to repurchase boats from its dealers  although it will on occasion voluntarily assist a dealer in selling a boat or it will repurchase a boat for the convenience of a dealer 
no boats were repurchased in fiscal  and fiscal in connection with floor plan arrangements 
at june    and  the company had recorded a  reserve for losses which may be reasonably expected to be incurred on boat repurchases in future years 
results of operations 
for fiscal  the company had a net income of  or 
per share 
this compares to a net loss of  or 
per share in fiscal the change in net income from the prior year s net loss is primarily due to proceeds received from the settlement of a lawsuit and insurance claims as a result of damages sustained from hurricanes dennis and floyd  the restructuring charge in  a drop in profit margins in due to changes in the company s sales mix  offset by reduced operating expenses 
during april  the company received  and recorded an extraordinary gain from the settlement of a class action lawsuit alleging antitrust violations against a vendor of the company who is in the sterndrive and inboard engine business 
during september  the company experienced flooding and the temporary closure of the production facility as a result of hurricanes dennis and floyd hitting eastern north carolina 
as a result of the hurricanes  the company sustained damages of approximately  to inventory and  to property  plant and equipment  which includes  in damages to the company s yacht mold 
the company incurred  in additional expenses 
the company has filed a business interruption claim for damages due to loss revenues from the closure of the production facility and inefficiencies due to storm preparation  cleanup and work force shortages 
as of june   the insurance carriers have paid  for damages to the inventory  property  plant  and equipment including the yacht mold and other expenses 
the company has filed its claim for business interruption and believed it complied with all aspects of its policy 
when a timely and reasonable resolution could not be reached  the company filed suit against its insurance carrier resulting in the insurance carrier re initiating meaningful discussions to resolve the claim 
as of june   the insurance carrier has advanced  towards the business interruption claim 
the full effects of a business interruption settlement cannot be reasonably estimated and will be recorded in the future when collected 
as of june  the company has recorded other income of  resulting from the gain on insurance claims from the hurricanes 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company designed and implemented a restructuring plan to aggressively improve the company s cost structure  refocus sales and marketing expenditures and divest the company of certain non realizable assets 
in connection with the restructuring plan the company reviewed components of its business for possible improvement of future profitability through reengineering or restructuring 
as part of this plan  the company decided to eliminate its direct racing program and reduce the yacht tooling cost carrying value  along with other discontinued unused tooling 
the carrying value of the assets held was reduced to fair value based on estimated realizable value based on future cash flows from use of the asset or sale of the related assets 
the resulting pretax adjustment of  was recorded as a strategic charge in the statement of operations of the company 
operating income increased to  in fiscal this compares with a loss of  in fiscal  primarily due to restructuring charges 
operating income decreased from  in fiscal  due to the less favorable sales mix with fishboat sales increasing by over  the initial year of defense boats  yacht start up  and a commitment by the company to maintain market share versus substantial price increases 
the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the change in the gross margin percentage was due to the overall sales mix of boats 
depreciation expense was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal depreciation expense by asset category was as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal land improvements    buildings    molds plugs    machinery equipment    furniture fixtures    transportation equipment    racing equipment    total    following is a schedule of the net fixed asset additions deletions during fiscal and fiscal fiscal fiscal buildings   land and improvements   molds and plugs   construction in progress   machinery equipment   furniture fixtures   transportation equipment   racing equipment  total   selling expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the company continued to promote its products primarily by magazine advertising in fiscal advertising expense was  for fiscal   in fiscal  and  for fiscal these advertising expenditures continue to promote the company s visibility in the recreational marine industry and its boat sales 
management believes that advertising is necessary in order to maintain the company s sales volume and dealer base 
additionally  in an effort to further promote its products  the company continued its offshore racing and tournament fishing programs 
these programs cost  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal selling expenses compared for the past three fiscal years were as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal offshore racing and tournament fishing    advertising    salaries commissions    boat shows    dealer incentives    other selling expenses    total    general and administrative expenses include the finance  accounting  legal  personnel  data processing  and administrative operating expenses of the company 
these expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal interest expense was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the increase in interest expense for fiscal was primarily due to an overall increase in prime rate throughout the fiscal year

however  relatively large amounts were needed to complete investment activities in purchasing property  plant  equipment  inventory and molds 
the ending cash balance was  net cash provided by operations in fiscal amounted to  net loss plus adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities including depreciation expense of  the strategic charge of  and other net items of  provided net cash of  before changes in asset and liability accounts 
however  relatively large amounts were needed to continue investment activities in purchasing property  plant  equipment  inventory and molds 
the ending cash balance was  operations in fiscal provided  in cash 
net income plus depreciation expense provided cash amounting to  however  relatively large amounts were needed to finance investment activities in purchasing property  plant  equipment  inventory and molds 
in addition  the new yacht construction with associated development costs added to the heavy use of cash 
the ending cash balance was  investing activities for fiscal required  including  for property  plant and equipment   for additional molds and plugs   for payments increasing the cash surrender value of life insurance policies and proceeds of  from the sale of property and equipment 
investing activities for fiscal required  including  for property  plant and equipment   for additional molds and plugs and  for payments increasing the cash surrender value of life insurance policies 
investing activities for fiscal required  including expenditures for additional molds and plugs amounting to  for property  plant and equipment for  and  for payments increasing the cash surrender value of life insurance policies 
financing activities for fiscal used  included in this amount are proceeds from issuance of notes payable and long term debt to northwestern mutual life insurance and general electric capital corporation for  and debt repayment in the amount of  financing activities for fiscal provided  included in this amount are proceeds from issuance of notes payable and long term debt to transamerica business credit corporation and general electric capital corporation for  along with total debt repayment of  financing activities for fiscal provided  included in this amount are proceeds from issuance of notes payable and long term debt to g 
e 
capital corporation for  and the retirement of previous long term debt of the net decrease in cash for fiscal was  primarily due to the investment in facilities  equipment  and molds 
the net increase in cash for fiscal was  primarily from a new  promissory note with transamerica business credit corporation  which included restatement and amendment of certain existing promissory notes with general electric capital corporation 
the net decrease in cash for fiscal was  primarily due to the investment in facilities  equipment and molds 
during fiscal  the company borrowed the remaining  against the initial general electric capital corporation loan  bringing the balance to  less the scheduled monthly principal reductions 
for fiscal  the company anticipates that the  beginning cash balance along with the net projected increase in cash provided from operations will be sufficient to meet most of the company s liquidity needs for the year 
the company intends to concentrate on reducing capital expenditures and building its cash reserves during fiscal effects of inflation 
the company has not been materially affected by the moderate inflation of recent years 
since most of the company s plant and its equipment are relatively new  expenditures for replacements are not expected to be a factor in the near term future 
when raw material costs increase because of inflation  the company attempts to minimize the effect of these increases by using alternative  less costly materials  or by finding less costly sources for the materials it uses 
when the foregoing measures are not possible  its selling prices are increased to recover the cost increases 
the company s products are targeted at the segment of the powerboat market where retail purchasers are generally less significantly affected by price or other economic conditions 
consequently  management believes that the impact of inflation on sales and the results of operations will not be material 
the year the yk bug was expected to affect a large number of computer systems and software during or after the year the concern was that any computer function that requires a date calculation might produce errors 
the company has taken the steps necessary to prevent those errors from occurring 
management is not presently aware of any year issues that have been encountered by any third party providers whose services are critical to the company  which could materially affect the company s operations 
at present  the company has spent approximately  in upgrading some of its software and hardware in order to avoid any problems resulting from the millennium bug 
the company does not expect to experience any operational difficulties as a result of year issues
