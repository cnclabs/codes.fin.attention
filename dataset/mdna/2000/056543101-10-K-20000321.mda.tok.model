the printing and converting segments gross profit margin increased percent due to improved operating efficiencies 
selling and administration selling and administration expenses of  increased  over the  reported in the increase resulted primarily from expenses associated with the reorganization of sales staffing in the paper products segment to provide for a product development function within the sales department  and an addition to the sales staff
