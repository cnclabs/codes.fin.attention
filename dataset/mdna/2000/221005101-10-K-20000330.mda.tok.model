item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from what is discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in our annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
overview corvas international is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical firm engaged in the design and development of a new generation of therapeutic agents for cardiovascular  cancer  stroke and other major diseases 
since our inception in  we have not generated significant revenues from product sales and we currently do not sell any commercial products 
we have not been profitable on an annual basis since inception and we anticipate that we will incur substantial additional operating losses over the next several years as we progress in our research and development programs 
we expect our sources of revenue  if any  for the next several years will continue to primarily consist of payments under collaborative agreements and interest income 
our historical results are not necessarily indicative of our future results 
in addition  we may not successfully develop  commercialize  manufacture or market any products or generate sufficient revenues to ever achieve or sustain profitability 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of  results of operations total revenues 
our total operating revenues in decreased to  from  in and  in revenues from collaborative agreements in  which decreased by  from the amount  included i  attributable to our strategic alliance agreement with schering plough to collaborate on the discovery and commercialization of an oral anticoagulant for chronic thrombosis  ii  related to our collaborative agreement with schering plough for the design and development of an oral inhibitor of a key protease associated with hepatitis c virus replication  iii  pursuant to the now terminated research and development agreement with vascular genomics inc  or vgi  and iv  attributable to our research and option agreement with pfizer inc to collaborate on the development of uk  previously designated as rnif 
no license fees and milestones were recognized in  compared to  in since we discontinued tissue factor manufacturing in  we had no product sales in  compared to  in we were awarded a small business innovation research grant in september to fund our malaria research program  which resulted in revenues of  in revenues from collaborative agreements in increased by  from and included i  attributable to our strategic alliance agreement with schering plough covering the discovery and commercialization of oral anticoagulants for chronic thrombosis  ii  related to our collaborative agreement with schering plough for the design and development of oral inhibitors of a key protease necessary for hepatitis c virus replication  iii  pursuant to the research and development agreement with vgi  and iv  attributable to our research and option agreement with pfizer to collaborate on the development of uk  previously designated as rnif 
license fees and milestones in decreased  from the amounts and were comprised of i a  milestone payment received from pfizer upon commencement of a phase i trial of uk  previously designated as rnif  ii a  milestone payment received from schering plough upon commencement of a phase i trial of an oral thrombin inhibitor  and iii license fees of  from the transfer of recombinant tissue factor manufacturing to two johnson johnson subsidiaries 
the  decrease in product sales comparing to is due to the discontinuation of tissue factor manufacturing 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenditures  which accounted for of our total costs and expenses in  in and in  decreased to  in from  in this  decrease was due to a lower headcount for most of  and the termination of the option and related research and development agreements with vgi 
research and development costs in increased by  from the amounts  primarily due to the vgi program and clinical development costs for rnapc general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in this  increase was due to settlement costs associated with the termination of the vgi program 
comparing to  general and administrative expenses decreased to  from  due mainly to reductions in legal  business development and recruiting costs 
other income 
total other income was  in   in and  in the largest component each year has been interest income  which has fluctuated based on varying cash balances available for investment 
in  we had interest income of  and interest expense of  the interest expense related to the senior subordinated convertible notes  in an aggregate principal amount of  that were issued in and are due in august in addition to interest income  the amount also included  from the sale of certain equipment and materials to a johnson johnson subsidiary in connection with the transfer of tissue factor manufacturing 
provided that additional capital is available  we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years as research and development and clinical trials progress 
however  we may not be able to raise any additional capital 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through a public offering and private placements of our debt and equity securities  payments from collaborative agreements  and interest income earned on cash and investment balances 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  time deposits and debt securities which  net of a restricted time deposit  totaled  and  as of december  and  respectively 
cash used in operations was  cash used in investing activities in  including  to purchase capital equipment  was  cash provided by financing activities in included  from the sale and issuance of convertible notes   from the sale of common stock which occurred simultaneously with the issuance of the notes  and  from the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and option plans 
subsequent to december   we received  in total net proceeds from the exercise of warrants held by three groups of institutional investors 
we invest available cash in accordance with an investment policy set by our board of directors  which has established objectives to preserve principal  maintain adequate liquidity and maximize income 
our policy provides guidelines concerning the quality  term and liquidity of investments 
we presently invest our excess cash primarily in government backed debt instruments and  to a smaller degree  in debt instruments of corporations with strong credit ratings 
in august  we issued and sold in a private financing  shares of common stock for per share and a convertible senior subordinated note  due in august  in an original principal amount of  upon maturity  this note will have an accreted value of  net proceeds of  were raised through the issuance of this note and net proceeds of  from the issuance of common stock 
interest on the outstanding principal amount of this note accretes at per annum from august to august  compounded semi annually  with interest payable upon redemption or conversion 
in october  we issued and sold in a private financing  shares of common stock for per share and an additional convertible senior subordinated note  also due in august  in an original principal amount of  upon maturity  this additional note will have an accreted value of  estimated net proceeds of  and  respectively  were raised through the issuance of the second note and the additional common stock 
interest on the outstanding principal of the second note accretes at per annum from october to august  compounded semi annually  with interest payable upon redemption or conversion 
at our option  the accretion on both notes may be paid in cash or in our common stock priced at the then current market price 
we have agreed to pay any applicable withholding taxes that may be required in connection with the accretion  which are estimated and accrued at of the annual accretion 
at the option of the note holder  the principal of both notes is convertible into shares of corvas common stock at per share  subject to certain adjustments 
we may call the notes for redemption anytime after august  we expect that we will continue to incur substantial additional costs in the foreseeable future due to  among other factors  costs related to ongoing and planned clinical trials and other research and development activities 
over the next several years  we expect these costs will result in additional operating losses and negative cash flows from operations 
we are continuing to pursue additional collaborative relationships  particularly for our nap program 
we currently believe that our existing resources  projected interest income and proceeds from the exercise of warrants in early should be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated funding requirements for more than years 
in the future  we may also receive additional funds from milestone payments and royalties on sales of products in connection with our alliances 
however  we may not receive any additional amounts under our existing or any future alliances  and we may not be successful in raising additional capital through strategic or other financings or through collaborative relationships 
additionally  our expected cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
strategic collaborations that are ongoing with schering plough and pfizer provide for payments to us if certain milestones are met 
in addition to future milestones  we may also receive royalties on product sales in connection with our existing alliances  as well as from any future alliances 
if all the milestones on all of our existing collaborations are met  corvas could receive a maximum of  in future milestone payments and research and development funding over the next several years 
our existing collaborations may not be successful  we may not receive any future milestones or other payments related to our collaborative agreements  and our collaborations may not continue since the existing agreements are terminable at the option of our collaborators upon certain events 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including o the scientific progress in  and magnitude of  our drug discovery programs  o the scope and results of our preclinical testing and clinical trials  o the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  o the costs of filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patents  o the progress of competing technology and other market developments  o our ability to establish and maintain collaborative or licensing arrangements  o any changes in our existing collaborative relationships  o the cost of manufacturing scale up  and o the effectiveness of our activities and arrangements  or those of our collaborative partners  to commercialize our products 
to continue our long term product development efforts  we must raise substantial additional funding either through collaborative arrangements or through public or private financings 
our ability to raise additional funds through sales of securities depends in part on investors perceptions of the biotechnology industry  in general  and of corvas  in particular 
the market for securities of biotechnology companies  including corvas  has historically been highly volatile and  accordingly  additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing securities  our stockholders will experience dilution  which may be substantial 
we may enter into additional collaborative relationships to develop and commercialize some or all of our current or future technologies or products 
we may not be able to establish such relationships on satisfactory terms  if at all  and agreements with collaborators may not successfully reduce our funding requirements 
in addition  we have not attempted to establish bank financing arrangements  and we may not be able to establish such arrangements on satisfactory terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available in the future  we may be required to significantly delay  scale back or discontinue one or more of our drug discovery programs  clinical trials or other aspects of our operations 
we could also be forced to seek collaborative partners for programs at an earlier stage than would be desirable to maximize the rights to future product candidates retained by corvas 
our net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income at december  were approximately  for federal income tax reporting purposes  and begin to expire in the net operating loss carryforwards for state purposes  which expire five years after generation  are approximately  we also had unused research and development tax credits for federal income tax reporting purposes of  at december  in accordance with internal revenue code section  the future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and credits may be limited as a result of defined ownership changes 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which was updated by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
sfas and sfas require companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities  with the instruments measured at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value gains and losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation 
sfas and sfas become effective for us on january   however we do not believe adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which includes certain revenue recognition issues related to biotechnology companies 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sab on our reported results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash in short term  high quality fixed income investments that are held to maturity 
we do not invest in derivative financial instruments or any other market risk sensitive instruments 
see note of the notes to financial statements for information about these financial instruments 
interest income earned on our short term investment portfolio is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates 
we believe that our interest rate market risk is limited  and that we are not exposed to significant changes in fair value because our investments are held to maturity 
the fair value of each investment approximates its amortized cost 
we have assumed that the similar nature of our short term investments warrant aggregation for purposes of interest rate sensitivity 
the principal amount of held to maturity investments at december   which mature at various dates in  is  the related weighted average interest rate is 
due to the fixed rate nature of the convertible notes payable that were issued in  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or our results of operations 
underlying market risk exists related to an increase in our stock price or an increase in interest rates that may make conversion of the convertible notes payable into common stock beneficial to the holder 
conversion of the convertible notes payable would have a dilutive effect on ownership of our stock
