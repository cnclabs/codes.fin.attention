item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations we explain our general financial condition and results of operations including results of operations why revenues  costs and earnings changed from the prior period funds from operations ffo how we used cash for capital projects and dividends during through and how we expect to use cash in where we plan on obtaining cash for future dividend payments and future capital expenditures impact of year technology issues on our operations because of legacy s exchange offer for our common stock  we report operating results for the year ended december  divided between the periods of january  to november  and november  to december   due to a new basis of accounting as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
for purposes of this discussion however  we combined these two periods of to make an equivalent twelve month period in order to compare operating results with the year ended december  in we changed our fiscal year end from august to december  which is required for reits 
because of this change  the transition period ended december consisted of only four months 
for that reason  we will compare our discussion of the year ended december  with the equivalent recast twelve month period of financial information for the year ended december  is unaudited and used for this discussion only 
as you read management s discussion and analysis  it may be helpful to refer to our financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page in management s discussion and analysis we explain the changes in specific line items in the statements of operations 
where changes are due to more than one reason  we list the reasons in order of importance 
rental revenues rental percent revenues change change year ended december   year ended december  year ended december   year ended december  unaudited revenues increased million to million in compared to because properties we acquired after the first quarter of generated million of additional revenues expansion of our self storage business provided an additional million of revenues revenues from properties we owned in both and increased million partially offsetting these increases were revenues from two properties which we sold in the second quarter of  which contributed million of revenues in the prior year and a reduction in revenues of million due to the caldors bankruptcy  a former tenant at our moorestown  nj location the impact in of our new accounting basis for the straight line accrual of future rental income  due to legacy s exchange offer for our common stock  was not material 
revenues increased million to million in compared to because properties we acquired at the end of and in generated million of revenues in expansion of our self storage business provided an additional million of revenue revenues from properties we owned in both and generated an additional million from new leases generating revenues revenues from properties sold or transferred to pricesmart in the distribution contributed million of revenues in the prior year revenues of million were lost from the homeplace bankruptcy  a former tenant at our dallas  tx location expenses percent amount change change year ended december  year ended december  year ended december   year ended december  unaudited expenses increased million to million in compared to primarily because properties we acquired after the first quarter of increased expenses million expansion of our self storage business increased expenses million these increases in expenses were partially offset by properties we sold in the second quarter of which reduced expenses by million and by the reduction of bad debt expense of million resulting in part from recovery of amounts previously written off related to the bradlee s bankruptcy  a former tenant at our seekonk  ma property the impact in of our new accounting basis for real estate asset depreciation  due to legacy s exchange offer for our common stock  was not material 
expenses decreased million to million in compared to primarily because we wrote off million in for asset impairments on properties held for sale because their book value was higher than what we expected to receive when the properties sold we wrote off costs in related to the pricesmart distribution  consisting of insurance  legal and accounting fees of million which contributed to our decrease in general and administrative expenses in properties we acquired at the end of and in increased expenses million expansion of our self storage business in increased expenses an additional million properties sold or transferred to pricesmart resulted in a decrease in expenses of million operating income percent amount change change year ended december   year ended december  year ended december   year ended december  unaudited operating income increased for and compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily because of the changes in rental revenues and expenses discussed above 
interest expense percent amount change change year ended december   year ended december  year ended december    year ended december unaudited during  interest expense increased million because we recorded million in interest expense related to our unsecured revolving credit facilities because our average debt outstanding in was million compared to million in  which relates primarily to the borrowing of million for our common stock repurchase in november we recorded million in interest expense related to the note payable associated with our san diego murphy canyon  ca self storage facility purchase we capitalized million of this million interest incurred to real estate assets during  interest expense increased million because we recorded million in interest expense related to our unsecured revolving credit facilities because our average debt outstanding in was million and we had no debt in we recorded million in interest expense related to the note payable associated with our san diego murphy canyon  ca self storage facility purchase we capitalized million of this million interest incurred to real estate assets we discuss our outstanding debt further in liquidity and capital resources located elsewhere in this form k 
interest income percent amount change change year ended december year ended december year ended december  year ended december  unaudited interest income decreased million to million in compared to primarily because of lower cash balances in and we used available cash and began borrowing in the second quarter of to fund acquisitions 
interest income decreased million to million in compared to primarily because we received full payment for a million interest bearing note receivable in we transferred previously invested cash and other interest bearing notes receivable to pricesmart in august we used previously invested cash for acquiring and developing properties gain loss on sale of real estate and investments net percent amount change change year ended december   year ended december year ended december year ended december unaudited during we sold the following properties for a gain of million location description date sales price gain buffalo  ny retail building vacant   dallas  tx shopping center   during we sold a free standing restaurant building at our azusa  ca property and recorded a  gain 
we also sold a free standing carwash at our northridge  ca site and recognized no gain or loss 
we consider these two parcels incidental to our main business 
the loss recorded in the year ended december  relates to the properties and investments sold prior to the pricesmart distribution 
provision for income taxes we have no income tax expense for and because of our reit status 
before we became a reit in september we recorded income taxes at an effective tax rate of 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in the year ended december  that offset the tax expense recorded 
the tax benefit related to a previously recorded income tax liability that was presumed no longer payable because of our conversion to a reit as well as income tax refunds receivable related to federal tax net operating loss carrybacks 
merger related costs in connection with the completion of legacy s exchange offer in november  we expensed million as follows amount vesting of preferred stock options accounting and legal other because our transaction with legacy resulted in a change of control in our company  we expensed million related to the vesting of preferred stock options as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
discontinued operations due to the pricesmart distribution in august  there were no discontinued operations in and the discontinued merchandising segment was transferred to pricesmart in the distribution 
funds from operations year ended december income before provision for income taxes    depreciation and amortization    provision for asset impairments  gain loss on sale of real estate and investments  net  other funds from operations    straight line rents    adjusted funds from operations    real estate industry analysts generally consider funds from operations ffo as another measurement of performance for real estate oriented companies 
in general  ffo adjusts net income for noncash charges such as depreciation  amortization and most non recurring gains and losses 
the national association for real estate investment trusts nareit  defines ffo as net income  excluding depreciation and amortization expense  and gains losses from certain sales of property 
we also exclude provisions for asset impairments and gains losses from sale of investments when we calculate ffo 
we also adjust the nareit definition to eliminate straight line rents in adjusted ffo because of their significance in our operations 
straight line rent accruals are noncash revenues associated with fixed future minimum rent increases 
ffo during decreased to million compared to because interest expense increased million  which relates directly to the borrowing of million for our common stock repurchase in november we expensed million in merger costs related to our transaction with legacy two properties we sold in the second quarter of reduced ffo million caldors  a former bankrupt tenant at our moorestown  nj location reduced ffo million these increases in expenses were partially offset by properties we acquired in which increased ffo million expansion of our self storage business which increased ffo million excluding intercompany rent the impact on ffo in of our new accounting basis due to legacy s exchange offer for our common stock was not material 
ffo during increased to million compared to because properties acquired at the end of and in generated million we reduced general and administrative expenses million primarily related to the pricesmart distribution expansion of our self storage business in generated million the change in net interest of million from million net interest income in to net interest expense in offset the increases in net operating income generated from our properties ffo for  excluding income earned from assets transferred to pricesmart  increased to million in from million in ffo and adjusted ffo do not represent the generally accepted accounting principles definition of cash flows from operations and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of our business operations 
capital resources represent those funds used or available to be used to support our business operations and consist of stockholders equity and debt 
cash flow from operations has been the principal source of capital to fund our ongoing operations and dividend payments  while use of our credit facilities and mortgage financing have been the principal sources of capital required to fund our growth 
while we are positioned to finance our business activities through a variety of sources  we expect to satisfy short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and through borrowings 
we continue to evaluate various properties for acquisition or development 
we purchased two retail properties and one office property from legacy in february for million 
in conjunction with these purchases  we assumed two long term mortgages secured by the two retail properties totaling million and one construction loan for million related to the office property 
we funded these purchases through advances on our revolving line of credit 
to the extent that investment opportunities exceed available cash flow from the sources mentioned above  we may raise additional capital through bank credit facilities and or secured mortgage financing 
from time to time we will consider selling properties to better align our portfolio with our geographic and tenant composition strategies 
we sold two properties from our portfolio for million during the second quarter of we are also contemplating selling certain other properties 
we may also participate in like kind property exchanges which allow us to dispose of properties and reinvest the proceeds in a tax efficient manner 
these sales may not be completed due to uncertainties associated with contract negotiations and buyer due diligence contingencies 
in december we obtained a million unsecured credit facility from wells fargo bank  amsouth bank and bank one 
this facility has a three year term with an initial interest rate of libor plus basis points 
the rate may vary based on our leverage and other financial ratios 
at december   there was million outstanding on the wells fargo facility at a interest rate 
in february we increased our unsecured credit facility to million 
the participating banks are now wells fargo bank  amsouth bank  bank one and fleet bankboston 
the facility s interest rate is now libor plus basis points 
in november we purchased million shares of our common stock for per share 
to fund this purchase  we obtained a million credit facility from morgan guaranty trust company the morgan facility which was subsequently amended to million 
in september we repaid the remaining million on our morgan facility and terminated the facility 
in conjunction with the san diego murphy canyon  ca self storage facility purchase  we assumed an existing million note secured by the property 
the note  payable to a financial institution  matures in july and bears an interest rate of 
the note does not permit repayment prior to july in august we distributed to stockholders of record one share of newly created series a preferred stock  par value  for each share of common stock held by them on the record date 
we raised no capital through this transaction 
the series a preferred stock pays quarterly dividends totaling per year with a per share liquidation preference 
prior to the distribution of series a preferred stock  we paid dividends on our common stock 
dividends of will be paid on the series a preferred stock and any dividends paid in excess of  will be paid to our common stockholders 
we have the right to redeem the series a preferred stock after august  or after a change of control of our company  which occurred with legacy s completion of their exchange offer for our common stock  at a redemption price of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends  if any 
year in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in  we completed upgrading our existing computer software and information technology and testing of our systems 
as a result of our planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in information technology and non information technology systems and we believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we spent approximately  in connection with upgrading our information technology systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our internal systems or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our computer systems throughout the year to ensure that we address any unknown year issues that may arise in a prompt manner 
inflation because a substantial number of our leases contain provisions for rent increases based on changes in various consumer price indices  based on fixed rate increases  or based on percentage rent if tenant sales exceed certain base amounts  we do not expect inflation to have a material impact on future net income or cash flow from developed and operating properties 
in addition  substantially all leases are triple net  which means specific operating expenses and property taxes are passed through to the tenant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates 
we do not have any foreign exchange or other significant market risk 
we did not have any derivative financial instruments at december  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our unsecured lines of credit 
we enter into variable rate debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we continuously evaluate our level of variable rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including our assessment of the current and future economic environment 
we had million in variable rate debt outstanding at december  based upon these year end debt levels  a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately million on an annual basis  and likewise decrease our earnings and cash flows 
we cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our variable rate debt  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available to us at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
