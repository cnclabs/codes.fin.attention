item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion presents management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
the company s results of operations depend primarily on i the level of oil and gas exploration and development activity of oil and gas companies in the gulf of mexico  offshore west africa  south and central america and the middle east  ii the company s ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements  and iii the company s ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends of oil and gas prices  exploration and production companies expectations of future oil and gas prices and changes in technology which reduce costs and improve expected returns on investment 
in addition  improvements in three dimensional seismic  directional drilling  production techniques and other advances in technology have increased drilling success rates and reduced costs 
prior to  the average number of active offshore rigs worldwide and in the gulf of mexico had increased annually since december  however  declining commodity prices  reduced drilling budgets and a lack of confidence in the recovery of commodity prices in caused a reduction in the level of drilling activity and a delay or suspension in projects being planned 
these commodity prices increased in and remain at elevated levels  which should increase drilling activity in the future 
during the fiscal years ended march   and   and  respectively  of the company s revenue was derived from projects fabricated for installation in international areas  with the remainder designed for installation in the gulf of mexico 
the company believes that its strong presence in both overseas markets and the gulf of mexico market has enabled it to remain competitive and obtain fabrication work worldwide 
the company expects that an increased activity level in the gulf of mexico will lead to an increasing percentage of the company s revenue coming from projects intended for installation in the gulf of mexico  although no assurance can be given as to continued strong commodity price or any resulting increased drilling activity by the oil and gas companies 
most of the company s revenue and expenses are recognized on a percentage of completion basis determined by the ratio that labor  labor and subcontracting costs  or total contract costs incurred bear to the total estimated labor  labor and subcontracting costs or total contract costs required for completion 
accordingly  expected labor and subcontracting costs and other contract costs are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
to the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction of previously reported profits  the company would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized on the basis of direct labor hours worked at fixed hourly rates and the cost of materials or subcontract costs incurred plus mark up 
results of operations comparison of the years ended march  and during the year ended march   the company s revenue was million  a decrease from the million generated in the year ended march  this decrease was primarily caused by the general reduction in demand for the company s structural fabrication services  and  to a lesser degree  process equipment design and fabrication services  both in the gulf of mexico and internationally 
generally  these reduced levels of demand were the result of continued delay in award of construction projects in spite of the recovery of the price of oil and gas 
total direct labor hours worked decreased from the levels experienced in the prior fiscal year 
in particular  structural fabrication and process equipment design and fabrication revenue decreased to million from million 
international project management revenue decreased to million 
rig refurbishment and plant maintenance revenue increased over the prior fiscal year to million  mainly due to the operations of obi  acquired in april cost of revenue was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these costs increased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal cost of revenue consists of costs associated with the fabrication process  including direct costs such as direct labor costs and raw materials and indirect costs that can be specifically allocated to projects such as supervisory labor  utilities  welding supplies and equipment costs 
the increase in costs as a percentage of revenues reflects reduced margins for all services from the same period last year caused by the decreased demand noted above and the increased competition for the projects being awarded 
this lower level of activity has resulted in a reduced number of man hours worked at the company s main fabrication facilities  thereby reducing profits available to cover the fixed overhead of those facilities 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this reduction in selling  general and administrative costs was mainly due to cost reductions resulting from consolidation of administrative functions and facilities  including elimination of certain duplicative administrative positions 
these reductions were offset in part by the additional selling  general and administrative costs of obi and cesi  which were acquired in fiscal interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  as the weighted average of invested funds was lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal  mainly from the investment of the company s available cash in facilities and equipment in fiscal and the overall reduced activity levels and profits in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense increased to million in from million in this increase is the result of increased borrowings under the company s line of credit  which funded asset expenditures and continued development of the company s deep water facility in lake charles  louisiana 
comparison of the years ended march  and during the year ended march   the company s revenue was million  a decrease from the million generated in the year ended march  this decrease was primarily caused by the general reduction in demand for the company s structural fabrication services brought on by continued low oil prices and a downturn in natural gas prices 
total direct labor hours worked decreased from the levels experienced in the prior year 
in particular  structural fabrication revenue decreased to million from million 
this decrease was offset in part by international project management revenue of million  and an increase in rig refurbishment and plant maintenance revenue of million over the prior year 
cost of revenue was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these costs decreased as a percentage of revenues to in from in fiscal this relative decrease is mainly due to higher margins on production process system design and fabrication work in fiscal this was offset in part by reduced margins on structural fabrication and rig refurbishment and plant maintenance in fiscal compared to selling  general and administrative expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company s selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in as compared to in fiscal this increase is mainly due to regulatory  reporting and other costs associated with being a corporation with publicly traded securities for a full year  increased amortization of goodwill from the pim and latoka acquisitions  and the additional selling  general and administrative costs associated with the company s operations in lake charles  louisiana and london  england 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  as the weighted average of invested funds was lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal  mainly from the use of the net proceeds of the company s initial public offering being invested in facilities and equipment in fiscal these funds were available for investment for the last six months of fiscal interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is the result of capitalized interest of approximately million  offset in part by increased borrowings under the company s line of credit and debt acquired in the acquisitions of allen tank and latoka 
other expense in fiscal includes costs of  associated with the pooling of allen tank 
this business combination was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and accordingly  the costs associated with the pooling were expensed as incurred 
liquidity and capital resources historically the company has funded its business activities through funds generated from operations  short term borrowings on its revolving credit facilities for working capital needs and individual financing arrangements for equipment  facilities improvements  insurance premiums  and long term needs 
the company s available funds and million generated from financing activities together funded cash used in operations of million and investing activities of million during the fiscal year ended march  investing activities consisted mainly of capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures included costs of expansion and improvements to the company s fabrication facility in new iberia  construction of a  square foot covered fabrication shop   square foot covered warehouse and mechanic shop  stabilization of acres at the company s lake charles development  purchases of modern  labor saving equipment and heavy machinery 
the company s growth has also required capital expenditures for equipment to update telecommunication and data processing capabilities 
the company is developing a deep water fabrication and drilling rig refurbishing facility on property leased from the lake charles harbor and terminal district in lake charles  louisiana 
estimated completion of the facility is july under the terms of the lease  the company is committed to fund capital expenditures totaling million to develop the facility and acquire equipment necessary for operations 
through march  the company has funded million toward this development 
the company has funded these capital expenditures through draws on its credit facility and cash from operations 
on november  l  the company entered into a secured senior credit facility agreement the agreement with a syndicated group of financial institutions the bank group for million in total credit facilities the secured senior credit facility 
under the terms of the facility  the company can borrow up to million for general corporate purposes under a revolving credit facility 
up to million is available under the revolving facility for standby letters of credit 
additionally  the secured senior credit facility provides for a million term loan with monthly principal payments of  plus interest  beginning december borrowings under the secured senior credit facility bear interest at the prime lending rate established by the banks or libor  at the company s option  plus a variable interest margin determined based on the ratio of the total funded indebtedness to ebitda  as defined in the agreement 
at march   the applicable borrowing rates  including the margin  were and  respectively 
the fee for issued letters of credit is per annum on the principal amount of letters of credit issued for performance or payment  or per annum on the principal amount if the letter of credit is a financial letter of credit 
the unused commitment fee is of per annum 
the letter of credit fees and unused commitment fees are variable based on the funded indebtedness to ebitda ratio described above 
the revolving portion of the secured senior credit facility matures november and the term portion matures november at march   the company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants in the secured senior credit facility 
the company exceeded the maximum funded indebtedness to ebitda ratio covenant and did not meet the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant  as defined in the agreement 
at the request of the company  the bank group has executed a waiver for these financial covenants for the period ended march  under the terms of the waiver  all new advances as well as all existing advances currently bearing interest at libor plus the applicable margin shall bear interest at the prime lending rate plus margin at june  
in addition  certain financial reporting requirements required quarterly under the secured senior credit facility will be reported monthly 
as a result of this noncompliance and anticipated noncompliance during fiscal year   outstanding under the secured senior credit facility has been classified current and included in notes payable in the march  balance sheet 
this reclassification resulted in a working capital deficit of million at march  the company expects to execute an amendment to the secured senior credit facility prior to august   which will establish a borrowing base agreeable to the bank group and the company  and which will establish financial covenants which are consistent with the company s current financial condition and anticipated outlook 
the company expects that execution of this amendment will allow the amounts outstanding under the secured senior credit facility to be classified as noncurrent 
in the event such an amendment does not occur  which management believes is unlikely  the company expects adequate operating cash flows or believes it has the ability to access other sources of capital 
accordingly  management does not believe this working capital deficit will affect the normal operations of the company during fiscal year at march   the company had million in borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility and million outstanding under the term loan 
management believes that its available funds  cash generated by operating activities  and funds available under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures  scheduled payments under the term credit facility and its working capital needs for the next months 
in the normal course of business  the company is evaluating its capital structure and is considering alternatives to the current credit facility structure 
additionally  any expansion of the company s operations through future acquisitions may require additional equity or debt financing 
intangible assets at march  the company had net intangible assets which represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
these net intangible assets represent goodwill recorded in connection with the company s acquisitions 
goodwill is being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
in assigning such amortization periods  the company considered the following factors i projected future cash flows of the acquired business  ii effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors that may reduce a useful life  and iii the expected actions of competitors and others that may restrict present competitive advantages 
management periodically assesses the recoverability of goodwill and considers whether it should be completely or partially written off or the amortization period accelerated 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the policy for evaluating goodwill for impairment 
at march   management determined that there is no persuasive evidence that any material portion of goodwill acquired will dissipate over a shorter period than the amortization period used 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the risk of changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest or currency risks 
interest on approximately million  substantially all of the company s notes payable was variable  based on short term interest rates 
a general increase of short term market interest rates would result in additional interest cost of  per year if the company were to maintain the same debt level and structure 
the company has a subsidiary located in the united kingdom for which the functional currency is the british pound 
the company typically does not hedge its foreign currency exposure 
historically  fluctuations in british pound us dollar exchange rates have not had a material effect on the company 
future changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar to the british pound may positively or negatively impact earnings  however  due to the size of its operations in the united kingdom  the company does not anticipate its exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations to be material in fiscal while the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments  it may use them in the future if deemed appropriate
