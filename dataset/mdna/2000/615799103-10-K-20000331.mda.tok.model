item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview the following table sets forth items included in the statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years indicated 
of net sales net sales cost of products sold gross profit selling  general administrative expenses operating income loss interest income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit 
net income loss results of operations compared with net sales for the year declined to million from million in the prior year 
net income for the year decreased to million compared with million 
earnings per share decreased to 
from 
a year ago 
the decrease in sales and net income is attributable to installation and implementation of the erp system  which is designed to enable moore medical to utilize advanced technologies to provide greater responsiveness to our customers needs 
we lost no sales days as a result of the implementation 
however  the transition did adversely impact our day to day sales operations  as customers experienced some delays in reaching customer support representatives 
the transition  whose impact on revenues and income cannot be quantified  was completed in the results follow five year record earnings in  which benefited from non recurring inventory disposition sales in our discontinued wholesale drug distribution business 
the gross profit margin rate was above for both years 
however  the gross profit dollars decreased slightly due to lower volumes  as well as greater competitive pricing on certain pharmaceutical products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased compared to during  we made investments in our staff to broaden the breadth of its abilities  our technology and technological applications to more effectively and efficiently serve our customers  and in our marketing resource so that we could more effectively compete in our changing industry 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily due to increased freight as well as increases in depreciation  consulting and legal expenses associated with the company s investment in technology 
we ended the year with no debt  while investing over million on technology capital 
further  at year end  we invested approximately million in cash and equivalents 
our effective income tax provision rate of was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due primarily to a net income tax benefit of million recorded from the favorable settlement of a prior year s tax matter 
compared with net sales for decreased to million from million in this was due primarily to exiting the wholesale drug distribution business in the fourth quarter of net sales in the wholesale drug distribution business decreased million in as compared with net sales in the healthcare practitioner business increased million or as compared to gross profit decreased to million in this decrease was due primarily to the reduced sales volume as a result of exiting the wholesale drug distribution business 
overall gross margin rates increased to from in the prior year 
this improvement was primarily due to the higher margins in the healthcare practitioner business 
the company s sales prices generally reflect changes in product acquisition costs  rather than the effects of inflation or deflation on the gross profit margin rate  which were not significant 
in  gross profit was negatively affected due to almost million of inventory markdowns and write offs associated with exiting from the wholesale drug distribution business and to approximately  of inventory markdowns for discontinued medical surgical supplies 
selling  general and administrative expenses during decreased  compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in staff  freight expense and other expenses previously associated with the wholesale drug distribution business 
as a result of exiting from this part of the business  the remaining healthcare practitioner business in carried and continues to carry the fixed selling  general and administrative expenses related to all facilities  systems  management and other overhead 
in addition  in  a pre tax charge of million was taken in connection with exiting various federal government supply contracts and a charge of approximately million was taken related to exiting the wholesale drug business 
all debt was retired in and the company therefore recorded income from its cash holdings instead of interest expense  as was the case in the effective income tax provision rate of was higher than the federal statutory tax rate due primarily to state income tax provision 
financial condition during our financial condition continued to remain stable 
we ended the year debt free for the second consecutive year 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million 
this cash combined with million of cash at the beginning of the year  was used for million of capital expenditures  primarily in technology 
operating activities generated cash sources of million from net non cash elements in earnings and million from increase in accounts payable 
operating activities used cash sources of million in accounts receivable  million from net change in other assets and liabilities and million for inventory 
we have an unsecured bank financing agreement which provides a million revolving line of credit that was extended through march  interest on loans is charged at the prime rate or  at our option  at the eurodollar rate plus a rate in a range of to depending on our financial leverage 
in addition  we pay a commitment fee on the unused line of credit 
as of january  we were in compliance with all the financial covenants under the agreement 
as our business grows  management believes that the funding needs for our operating working capital and investments will continue to be met through cash flow from operations and financing available under our line of credit 
year issues year issues are the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
our computer programs with date sensitive functions were sufficiently converted to be year compliant 
we experienced no failures  miscalculations  disruptions of operations  inability to process transactions  send invoices or interruptions in other normal business activities as a result of the year arrival 
this was essentially due to information technology planning and the implementing of year compliant systems 
we identified our year risks in three categories internal business software  internal non information technology software  and external vendor compliance 
internal information technology during  as part of a modernization program intended to improve productivity and increase profitability by upgrading data processing  integrating systems and enhancing internal reporting  the company purchased an erp system which includes software which the vendor has represented to be year compliant 
the total estimated hardware  software  installation  enhancements and training cost of the integrated erp system  of which year compliance was a by product  was million which was primarily funded through operating cash flow 
we substantially completed the implementation of the system during the second quarter of with this implementation  we believed that our internal information technology systems to be in substantial compliance 
contingency plans were developed for areas where management considered there may have been some risk to modify certain of the major existing internal information technology systems to be year compliant 
internal non information technology we have assessed the year compliance of its internal non information software and of the technology embedded in such systems as security  telecommunications and building systems by contacting the providers of such systems 
written assurance of year compliance had been received from substantially all providers 
external vendor compliance the company had identified and contacted its major suppliers  service providers and contractors vendors to determine the extent of their year compliance 
to the extent that responses were unsatisfactory  the company had contingency plans in place  which included a number of measures such  where necessary  changing the vendors to those who have represented year readiness 
when the year arrived  the company had not experienced any material year problems  nor had the company experienced any material problems with any of its key customers or vendors
