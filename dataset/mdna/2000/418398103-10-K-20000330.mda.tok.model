these factors include a decrease in net sales in of  a decrease in the gross profit margin  which was primarily impacted by non recurring costs associated with the conversion and start up of various production processes  and an increase in other expenses  which was driven by higher interest costs associated with the restructuring of long term debt 
these negative factors were offset slightly by a reduction in total operating expenses  reflecting the company s continued efforts to control these expenses 
while  as discussed below  net sales  operating expenses and other expenses were relatively comparable between fourth quarter and  fourth quarter cost of sales increased by  or 
the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increased workers compensation costs combined with an increase in cast iron costs 
the cost of sales increase is the primary cause of the fourth quarter pre tax loss of  compared to fourth quarter pre tax income of  a change of  the fourth quarter net loss was  compared to net income of  for the comparable period in as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in october the company formed a joint venture company for the purpose of expanding its additives offerings through both increased global market penetration and an expansion of the product offerings under the casite name 
the additional product offerings are expected to become available in mid while the company is optimistic regarding the future opportunities relative to the expansion of the additives business  it is not expected to have a significant impact on operations 
results of operations net sales compared to net sales for decreased  or  from  in to  the decrease in net sales primarily reflects a decline in the company s export volume 
the export volume was negatively affected by specific political and economic factors in the foreign countries where the company conducts business  combined with the effects of realigning the distribution channel within one of the company s major foreign markets 
the net sales decrease also reflects slight reductions in volume in the company s domestic aftermarket and private brand and original equipment markets  offset by a sales increase in the canadian aftermarket 
net sales were relatively flat in the fourth quarter of in comparison to the same period in compared to net sales for increased  or  from the increase reflected growth in the company s domestic aftermarket  private brand and export markets 
growth in the domestic aftermarket reflected the company s increased focus on that aspect of the piston ring market 
growth in the private brand area was the result of increased volume to several major customers 
the increase in the export area reflected the success of the on going development of the company s country direct export efforts 
cost of sales and gross profit compared to cost of sales for increased  or  from  in to  this increase  along with the noted decrease in net sales  resulted in a gross profit margin decrease to in from in the increase in cost of sales and decrease in the gross profit margin are the result of several factors 
during  the company s cost of sales was negatively impacted by non recurring costs associated with the conversion and start up of various production processes 
as a result of this conversion  productivity levels were not at their anticipated needs 
in order to cover these production deficiencies and further improve production levels  additional labor and overhead costs were incurred throughout these additional costs were necessary in order to raise production levels up to the point where customer order fill performance could be  and was  improved in in addition  due to the tight labor market in the local area  the company experienced unplanned employee turnover in  which also negatively affected the production efficiency issue 
the company aggressively addressed these issues throughout  and is now focusing on further elevating its production capabilities as it continues the implementation of lean manufacturing methods 
lean manufacturing refers to a discipline of arranging the workflow in such a manner as to minimize or eliminate any waste of materials or labor 
the company is likewise evaluating the changes necessary to support and sustain an efficient workforce 
these issues had an effect on several of the individual production cost factors for material costs remained relatively unchanged from the prior year average with increases in cast iron costs  primarily in the fourth quarter  being offset by reductions in rolled steel costs 
labor costs increased slightly as a result of the collective bargaining agreement  but this increase was offset by less overtime incurred in  in comparison to when additional overtime was required to meet increased customer demand 
while labor costs decreased in total for the year  the decrease was much less than the relative decrease in net sales  thus contributing to the reduced gross profit margin  as discussed above 
overhead costs increased for as a result of the production issues noted above  and the recognition of increased workers compensation costs during the fourth quarter upon notification of a retroactive adjustment by the company s insurance carrier  combined with increased current claims activity 
the increase in overhead costs  which are largely fixed in nature  also contributed to the reduced gross profit margin for the year 
the net cost component increases were offset slightly by the positive effect of the liquidation of lifo inventory layers which was comparable to the liquidation as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements approximately  and  pre tax reduction in cost of sales for and  respectively 
as previously noted  cost of sales for the fourth quarter of increased by  or  over the fourth quarter of the increase was primarily due to an increase in workers compensation costs combined with an increase in cast iron costs which  by being on the lifo method of costing for raw materials inventory  were recognized currently in cost of sales 
in spite of the increased fourth quarter cost of sales compared to the prior year  the gross profit margin generated in the fourth quarter was higher than the margin reported through the third quarter of  reflecting the company s initial success in aggressively addressing the above noted production issues 
compared to cost of sales for increased  or  from the increase in cost of sales reflected the corresponding increase in net sales 
the gross profit margin increased to in from in this increase was primarily due to a decrease in certain raw material costs with overhead costs increasing at a rate lower than the sales increase  given the fixed nature of a large portion of those costs 
these decreases were partially offset by increased labor costs 
labor costs increased in as a result of the collective bargaining agreement  additional overtime required to support increased customer demand and the company s efforts to significantly reduce the cycle time from customer order to product shipment 
operating expenses compared to total operating expenses for decreased  or  from  in to  advertising expenses decreased  or  from the total 
this decrease reflects a reduction in advertising support costs in  combined with the inclusion  in  of a biannual customer service tips manual 
selling expenses increased  or  from the total 
this increase reflects increases in agent based commissions  salesmen s travel and sales promotion costs  offset by a slight decrease in sales support costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from the total 
this decrease is due to reductions in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable  as discussed below  and salaried personnel costs  offset by slight increases in various administrative support costs 
the decrease also reflects the inclusion  in  of approximately  of severance costs related to staffing reductions 
fourth quarter operating expenses were lower than the total primarily due to increased agent based commissions  sales bonuses and workers compensation costs  as discussed above  being more than offset by a charge relating to two uncollectible accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of compared to total operating expenses for increased  or  from advertising expenses decreased  or  from the total 
this decrease reflected the cost of a biannual product catalog expense in  combined with minor reductions in cooperative advertising  printed material and various other advertising costs 
these reductions were offset slightly by an increase in advertising support staff salaries and the inclusion of the biannual customer service tips manual in selling expenses decreased  or  from the total 
this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in various sales personnel expenses  offset slightly by a sales driven increase in agency commissions 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  from the total 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable  offset by a number of insignificant account decreases 
the provision increase  which amounted to  related primarily to two customer accounts 
other expenses compared to other expenses  net for increased  over the net total 
this increase primarily reflects the higher interest expense associated with the restructuring of the company s long term debt obligations in late august of other expenses also reflects the interest income derived from the funds generated by the filter operations sale held in escrow through september and the gain on sale of obsolete plant equipment  which is included in the other  net expense 
other expenses  net for the fourth quarters of and were comparable 
compared to other expenses  net for increased by  over the total 
interest expense for was significantly impacted by the restructuring of the company s short and long term debt obligations in late august of that year 
increased short term borrowings through late august of reflected the increased working capital requirements as driven by the net sales increase 
the restructuring of the short and long term debt resulted in increased long term debt obligations which resulted in increased interest expense for the fourth quarter  and year end  of the interest income reflects the income derived from the escrowed filter sale funds 
taxes on income the impact of income taxes on the reported results of the company is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the  and effective tax rates of  and  respectively  are higher than the statutory federal tax rate of due primarily to the impact of state income taxes and certain nondeductible expenses 
the effective tax rate was also affected by the increase in the valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits that are expected to expire unutilized in as of december   the company recorded net deferred income tax assets of  the major components include the tax effect of net operating loss carryforwards of  and net accrued retirement and postretirement benefit obligations totaling  the realization of these recorded benefits is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
the net operating loss carryforwards fully expire in   and  if not previously utilized 
management has prepared projections of taxable income for future years indicating that the cumulative net operating loss is expected to be fully utilized by late the company further expects to be able to realize the deferred tax assets related to the retirement and postretirement benefit obligations as it pays these benefits 
such payments will constitute an expense that is deductible for tax reporting purposes over many future years 
during each of the ten years prior to when the recent net operating loss carryforwards arose  the company has been able to deduct these benefits for tax reporting purposes and reduce its tax liability accordingly 
as a result of the plan amendment to the retiree medical plan as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  current tax deductible payments are expected to exceed the annual expense recognition for financial reporting purposes  thus accelerating the absorption of the future periods tax benefit 
management believes that it is more likely than not that adequate levels of future income will be generated to absorb the net operating loss carryforwards  the deductible amounts related to the retirement and postretirement benefit obligations and the remaining net deductible temporary differences 
in addition  based upon projected foreign source income  management believes that it is more likely than not that the foreign tax credits  net of the valuation allowance at december   will be utilized prior to their expiration 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary cash requirements continue to be for operating expenses such as labor costs and raw materials  and for funding capital expenditures and long term debt service 
historically  the company s primary sources of cash have been from operations and from bank borrowings 
subsequent to december   the company entered into an agreement with its primary lender to amend the terms of its short and long term debt obligations 
the amendment increases the short term line available to the company from  to  the amendment also modifies the payment schedule of the company s long term debt obligation  and provides the primary lender with a security position in certain assets of the company  as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of this amendment  and based on an anticipated improvement in profitability  the company expects to generate sufficient future funds from operations and bank borrowings to fund its growth and operating needs 
total short term lines available to the company as of december  totaled  of which  was unused 
this increased to  and  respectively  with the amended loan agreement 
in an effort to minimize its floating rate debt exposure  the company is a party to an interest rate swap agreement essentially fixing the interest rate on that debt within a small range 
the rate will fluctuate within to depending upon certain company performance parameters 
as of december   the fixed rate on those borrowings was 
during  the company generated  of net cash from operating activities 
the realized net income and depreciation  combined with decreases in accounts receivable  prepaid pension cost and deferred income taxes  were partially offset by increases in inventories and decreases in accounts payable and accruals and the postretirement benefit obligation 
the decrease in accounts receivable reflects the timing of customer sales and related payment terms associated with those sales 
the decrease in the prepaid pension cost reflects the recognition of pension expense for the decrease in the net deferred income tax asset reflects the reduction of several deferred tax items  partially offset by the deferred tax effect of the net operating loss for tax purposes 
the increase in inventories reflects the company s continued efforts toward having sufficient product on hand in order to maintain adequate order fill for its customers 
the decrease in accounts payable and accruals primarily reflects the reduction in the compensation accrual  offset by slight increases in general accounts payable and miscellaneous payables 
the decrease in the postretirement benefit obligation reflects the excess of actual postretirement benefits paid over the actuarially determined annual expense 
the investing activities for reflect a decreased requirement for new capital equipment  as the company moves to finalize its full transition into a lean manufacturing environment 
the investing activities also reflect the proceeds from the sale of obsolete plant equipment 
the financing activities for reflect the working capital requirements that were primarily needed to fund the operating activity items noted above 
the financing activities also reflect the amortization of the company s long term debt obligation 
on february   the company announced a common stock repurchase program 
the program calls for the repurchase of up to  shares in the open market 
the repurchased stock will be retired 
on february   the company repurchased  shares 
funds for the repurchase  amounting to approximately  were borrowed on the company s short term line of credit 
the company intends to purchase additional shares of its stock under this program throughout  subject to acceptable levels of cash flows and favorable market conditions 
in late august  the company entered into a  long term debt agreement with its primary lender 
this new agreement allowed the company to take advantage of favorable interest rate conditions 
borrowings under this new long term debt agreement were used for several purposes including raising the company s defined benefit plans to funding levels that would alleviate the payment of the variable rate pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc premiums  consolidating the remaining long term debt obligations  and paying down certain short term notes payable 
as a result of this new agreement  the company s short term line with its primary lender was reduced from  to  this amount has subsequently been raised to  per the amended short and long term debt agreement as described above 
during  the company used  of net cash for operating activities 
the realized net income  depreciation and decrease in deferred income taxes  were offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid pension cost and a decrease in the postretirement benefit obligation 
the decline in the deferred income tax asset was primarily the result of the additional funding of the company s defined benefit pension plans  and the partial utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
the increase in accounts receivable and inventories reflect the additional working capital requirements that were necessary to support the higher sales level 
the increase in the prepaid pension cost of  reflects the funding of the company s defined benefit plans to specified limits 
as such  it did not have a direct effect on operations during excluding this item  net cash generated from operating activities amounted to  the investing activities for reflect the company s commitment to enhancing its production capabilities through the implementation of lean manufacturing principles 
investing activities also reflect the september release of escrowed funds relating to the sale of filter operations 
these funds were subsequently used to reduce short term notes payable 
financing activities reflect the increased reliance on short term borrowings to help satisfy increased working capital needs 
financing activities also reflect the proceeds from the new long term debt agreement and subsequent utilization of a portion of the proceeds to pay down short and long term debt 
dividends paid increased in due to the improved operating results 
during  the company generated net cash of  from operating activities 
the realized net income  depreciation and decrease in deferred income taxes were only partially countered by increases in accounts receivable and a reduction in the postretirement benefit obligation 
the decline in the deferred income tax asset is the result of the partial utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards  while the postretirement benefit factor reflects  in part  the impact from the modification of the retiree health plan that was effective in april the majority of the company s investing activities reflect capital equipment purchases that the company utilized to enhance its production capabilities 
the financing activities for reflect a modest decrease in reliance on short term borrowings combined with the reduction of long term debt levels through normally scheduled quarterly payments 
as noted throughout the above discussion  the company is aggressively addressing the production issues that negatively affected its earnings in as the company completes its move toward the adoption of a lean manufacturing environment  it should enhance its ability to further its growth and to generate sufficient cash flow to sustain this growth 
the company will continue to monitor its working capital needs in order to balance its cash and growth demands 
at this time  the company anticipates that operations which will be subject to minimal current cash outflows for us income taxes due to the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards  in combination with the balancing of available short term lines with operations  will generate cash flows that will be sufficient to funds its working capital  capital outlays and dividend requirements through litigation contingency as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on january   the company s retirees filed a class action lawsuit against the company as a result of the april amendment of the company s postretirement benefit plans 
the plans were amended principally to adjust the cost sharing provisions 
the suit alleges that the company denied class retirees and their dependents certain health insurance benefits to which the retirees had a vested right pursuant to the terms of the company s collective bargaining agreements to the present 
the company has denied any wrongdoing in this suit  and intends to defend it and any related class certification vigorously 
however  due to the fact that this lawsuit is in its early stages  the company s ultimate success in prevailing against the retirees charges is uncertain at this time 
if the retirees position prevails  it is anticipated that a requirement to provide postretirement benefits at the pre amendment level would have a material adverse effect on the future financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
the case is scheduled for trial june  new accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  issued in june  requires companies to recognize all derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure them at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge  the objective of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of i the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk or ii the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  historically  the company has not entered into derivatives contracts for speculative purposes 
the company does periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate borrowings 
however  the fair value of such derivatives are not significant 
accordingly  the company does not expect adoption of the new standard on january  to materially affect its consolidated financial statements
