item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning in  uti decided to expand its land drilling operations 
management of uti made this decision to take advantage of improving market conditions benefits arising from a consolidation in the land drilling industry to effect this strategy  uti disposed of its oilfield distribution business in september and embarked on an acquisition program aimed at expanding uti s presence in the oil and natural gas producing regions in the united states 
under this strategy  uti has acquired rigs since during this same time period  uti disposed of nine rigs primarily in the appalachian basin 
five of the nine rigs disposed of were sold in uti s revenues grew substantially during and as a result of acquisitions increased rig utilization and dayrates caused by favorable market conditions beginning in and continuing into  uti and the united states land drilling industry experienced significant declines in demand and pricing for their services 
the depressed market conditions caused uti s rig fleet utilization to decrease from in to in and to in in response to these depressed industry conditions  uti undertook a series of actions during the third quarter of and the first quarter of designed to improve efficiency increase productivity make uti more competitive in the marketplace these actions included streamlining of certain contract drilling operations personnel changes changes to the accounting and administrative functions  including the relocation of certain accounting functions from oklahoma city to uti s corporate headquarters in houston this consolidation of operations reduced uti s regional drilling units from seven to four 
it also reduced uti s administrative staff by forty six persons 
as a result of the above actions  uti recorded other charges of 
million during and 
million during the charges consisted primarily of employee related expenses 
in addition  uti sold certain non strategic assets of its appalachian basin contract drilling division for million 
as a result  uti recorded a gain of approximately million during the first quarter of 
table of contents uti currently expects market conditions in the land drilling industry to improve in response to the recent improvement in commodity prices for oil and natural gas 
in this regard  uti expects its average utilization during the first quarter of to be more than the average utilization experienced during the dayrate component of drilling contracts also have increased during the first quarter of as conditions in the land drilling industry improve  uti believes that its strong liquidity position and balance sheet provide it with the financial ability to react quickly to opportunities in the land drilling industry 
results of operations uti believes the number of land rigs actively drilling in the united states indicates the overall strength of the united states oilfield service industry 
without giving effect to acquisitions  variations in uti s revenues and gross margins generally follow trends in the united states rig count 
the following table presents certain results of operations data for uti and the average united states rig count as reported by baker hughes inc for the periods indicated years ended december  operating data average us active land rig count number of rigs owned by uti at end of year average number of rigs owned during year average rigs operating land drilling operating days    utilization rate pressure pumping cementing jobs    stimulation jobs financial data in thousands revenues    gross profit    as a percentage of revenue operating income loss    baker hughes  inc is an international oilfield service and equipment company 
for more than twenty years  it has conducted and published a weekly census of active drilling rigs 
its active rig count is generally regarded as an industry standard for measuring industry activity levels 
an operating day is defined as a day during which a rig is being operated  mobilized  assembled or dismantled while under contract 
utilization rates are calculated by dividing the operating days by the total available days  including stacked rigs 
available days are calculated by multiplying rigs owned by the days in the period under review 
for the year ended december   the utilization rate of uti s rigs  excluding stacked rigs  was 

table of contents comparison of years ended and revenues by business segment for the years ended december  and are as follows years ended december  increase decrease in thousands revenues land drilling   pressure pumping   other despite the net acquisition of sixteen rigs during the year ended december   land drilling revenue decreased 
the decrease was attributable to depressed market conditions 
pressure pumping revenue also decreased as a result of depressed market conditions 
these depressed market conditions resulted in lower utilization rates lower rates for services gross profit and gross profit percentage by business segment for the years ended december  and are as follows years ended december  in thousands gross profit land drilling   pressure pumping   other the gross profit of the land drilling segment declined due to depressed market conditions

table of contents land drilling revenues remained flat as a result of depressed market conditions 
these depressed market conditions resulted in lower utilization rates lower dayrates and prices received on footage and turnkey contracts however  these factors were offset by additional revenues from rigs acquired during and the increase in pressure pumping revenue resulted from an increase in pressure pumping jobs and related rates 
uti s pressure pumping operations were not as adversely affected by declining oil and natural gas prices as uti s land drilling operations
