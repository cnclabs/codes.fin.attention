year readiness disclosure the year issue is the potential for system and processing failure of date related data and the result of computer controlled systems using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
problems associated with the year may not become apparent until some time after january the company established a year compliance committee the committee which was comprised of members of senior management  finance  mis  operations and engineering 
the committee s mandate was to design and implement a compliance plan that minimizes the risk of material adverse impact to the company resulting from events triggered by the turn of the century 
the committee defined three categories of internal elements that were subject to risk  computer hardware and software  manufacturing equipment and building equipment 
computer hardware and software included networking  operating and application software being used by the company as well as those that were planned to be installed prior to the year  and the hardware platforms upon which they operate 
manufacturing equipment included machinery and equipment  owned or leased  that is used by the company in the process of manufacturing inventory for resale 
ufpt k page building equipment included all other devices that potentially have microprocessing chips that were not included in computer hardware and software and manufacturing equipment  including  but not limited to  fax machines  security systems  heating air conditioning  telephone and other communication systems  copiers  sprinklers and elevators 
the approach for minimizing risk of noncompliance within each of these elements included four distinct phases inventory  assessment  conversion and implementation 
in the inventory phase the company identified the items within each of the three previously defined elements 
the assessment phase included identifying which of the items in the inventory were non compliant 
the items in inventory were assessed in an order of priority based upon the committee s opinion of their relative importance to the company s operations 
in the conversion phase the company repaired or replaced those items that were non compliant 
the company substantially implemented new financial and manufacturing software new software  throughout all of its plants  that is year compliant which resulted in compliance within the computer hardware and software element 
the company did not identify a manufacturing machine that was not year compliant 
in the implementation phase  the company put into operation repaired or new devices that were year compliant 
on january   the company tested all of its business critical computer hardware and software  manufacturing equipment  and building equipment  and found all of them to be functioning properly 
additionally  upon restarting operations  on january   no year related failures were experienced 
independent of its own internal elements  the company is dependent upon the customers who order its products and upon numerous third parties who supply various items including materials  supplies  services  utilities and other items the company uses in the ordinary course of business 
included within these third parties is a group of several key foam raw material suppliers that collectively supply a significant portion of the company s foam used in production 
the company evaluated the compliance status of its customers and third party suppliers 
no business interruption was experienced as a result of a failure of key suppliers to provide materials  services  or other items 
also  no interruptions in orders from key customers were experienced 
the company included the cost of the new software in its financial statements for and in its plan for the software and hardware costs have been and will be capitalized and depreciated in compliance with the company s capitalization policy 
although the decision to implement the new software resolved the year problem for the majority of the company s computer applications  it was made for operating reasons and was is considered normal capital expenditures 
as a result  the company did not incur material costs above and beyond the cost of implementing the new software 
the company is substantially compliant  but can give no assurance as to the ongoing readiness of its key material and service providers 
the company completed a contingency plan the plan that addresses the operating issues in the event that any of its material or service providers fail to perform 
in addition  the plan addresses operating considerations in the event that any of the company s internal elements fail to perform as expected 
the company can give no assurance that the plan will be effective 
ufpt k page other a significant portion of the company s packaging sales of molded fiber products are to manufacturers of computer peripherals and other consumer products 
as a result  the company believes that its sales are somewhat seasonal  with increased sales in the second half of the year 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations in the last three years 
market risk the following discussion of the company s market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and equity prices 
at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents consisted of bank accounts in us dollars  and their valuation would not be affected by market risk 
the company has two debt instruments where interest is based upon the prime rate and or libor and  therefore  future operations could be affected by interest rate changes  however  the company believes that the market risk of the debt is minimal
