the company believes that cash flow from operations and the million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at october   together with funds available under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to support its operations and provide for budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million and liquidity requirements through fiscal however  the company s long term liquidity requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the rate at which the company expands its business  whether internally or through acquisitions and strategic alliances 
in addition  strategic opportunities the company may pursue will require it to fund its portion of operating expenses of such ventures  and may further require it to advance additional amounts should any partners in such ventures be unable to meet unanticipated capital calls or similar funding events 
to the extent that the funds generated from the sources described above are insufficient to fund the company s activities in the long term  the company will be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing

inflation and general economic condition although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on its operations  the company does not believe that inflation has had  or is likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material effect on its business results of operations or financial condition 
year risks the company experienced no significant year compliance issues and year issues did not have a material effect on its business  operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s revolving credit facility with wells fargo is a million line of credit with an interest rate based on the prime rate or libor plus  at the company s option 
the line of credit expires on march  because the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is variable  the company s cash flow may be affected by increases in interest rates  in that the company would be required to pay more interest in the event that both the prime and libor interest rates increase 
management does not  however  believe that any risk inherent in the variable rate nature of the loan is likely to have a material effect on the company s interest expense or available cash 
the company currently maintains a zero balance on the revolving credit facility 
even if the company were to draw down on the line prior to its expiration and an unpredicted increase in both alternated rates occurred  it would not be likely to have a material effect on the company s interest expense or available cash 
sensitivity analysis 
assuming the company had a million balance outstanding as of october   the rate of interest calculated using the prime rate option would be 
the company s monthly interest payment  if the rate stayed constant  would be  if the prime rate rose to  which assumes an unusually large increase  the company s monthly payment would be  a more likely increase of or  given the recent trend of decreasing or relatively low interest rates  would result in a monthly payment of  or  respectively 
the company does not believe the risk resulting from such fluctuations is material or that the payment required would have a material effect on cash flow
