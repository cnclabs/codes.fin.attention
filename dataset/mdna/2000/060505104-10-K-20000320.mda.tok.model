year project for the past several years  the corporation has been taking corrective measures to ensure that  on january   its computer systems and equipment that use embedded computer chips would be able to distinguish between and the corporation also undertook corrective measures to avoid any business disruptions on february  as a result of the millennium s first leap year 
due to these efforts  the corporation has not experienced any material system errors or failures as a result of year issues 
prior to december   the corporation designed and implemented an event management communications center as a single point of coordination and information about all year events  whether internal or external  that could impact normal business processes 
the corporation will continue to staff this center as needed through the end of the first quarter of in addition  the corporation will continue its business as usual practices to monitor its computer systems and infrastructure  as well as the year efforts of third parties with which the corporation does business 
although the corporation does not anticipate that any future year issues will result in a material impact on the corporation  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
the corporation has incurred cumulative year costs of approximately million through december  a significant portion of these costs was not incremental to the corporation but instead constituted a reallocation of existing internal systems technology resources and  accordingly  was funded from normal operations 
remaining costs are expected to be immaterial and similarly funded

credit risk arises through the extension of loans and leases  certain securities  letters of credit  financial guarantees and through counterparty exposure on trading and capital markets transactions 
to manage this risk  the credit risk management group establishes policies and procedures to manage both on and off balance sheet credit risk and communicates and monitors the application of these policies and procedures throughout the corporation 
the corporation s overall objective in managing credit risk is to minimize the adverse impact of any single event or set of occurrences 
to achieve this objective  the corporation strives to maintain a credit risk profile that is diverse in terms of product type  industry concentration  geographic distribution and borrower or counterparty concentration 
the credit risk management group works with lending officers  trading personnel and various other line personnel in areas that conduct activities involving credit risk and is involved in the implementation  refinement and monitoring of credit policies and procedures 
the corporation manages credit exposure to individual borrowers and counterparties on an aggregate basis including loans and leases  securities  letters of credit  bankers acceptances  derivatives and unfunded commitments 
in addition  the creditworthiness of individual borrowers or counterparties is determined by experienced personnel  and limits are established for the total credit exposure to any one borrower or counterparty 
credit limits are subject to varying levels of approval by senior line and credit risk management 
the corporation also manages exposure to a single borrower  industry  product type  country or other concentration through syndications of credits  credit derivatives  participations  loan sales and securitizations 
through the global corporate and investment banking segment  the corporation is a major participant in the syndications market 
in a syndicated facility  each participating lender funds only its portion of the syndicated facility  therefore limiting its exposure to the borrower 
in conducting derivatives activities  the corporation may choose to reduce credit risk to any one counterparty through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements which allow the corporation to settle positive and negative positions with the same counterparty on a net basis 
for more information on the corporation s off balance sheet credit risk  see note eleven of the consolidated financial statements on page for commercial lending  the originating credit officer assigns borrowers or counterparties an initial risk rating which is based primarily on a thorough analysis of each borrower s financial capacity in conjuction with industry and economic trends 
approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and the counterparty and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit risk personnel 
credits are monitored by line and credit risk management personnel for deterioration in a borrower s or counterparty s financial condition which would impact the ability of the borrower or counterparty to perform under the contract 
risk ratings are adjusted as necessary 
for consumer and small business lending  credit scoring systems are utilized to determine the relative riskiness of new underwritings and provide standards for extensions of credit 
consumer portfolio credit risk is monitored primarily using statistical models and regular reviews of actual payment experience to predict portfolio behavior 
when required  the corporation obtains collateral to support credit extensions and commitments 
generally  such collateral is in the form of real and personal property  cash on deposit or other highly liquid instruments 
in certain circumstances  the corporation obtains real property as security for some loans that are made on the general creditworthiness of the borrower and whose proceeds were not used for real estate related purposes 
an independent credit review group conducts ongoing reviews of credit activities and portfolios  reexamining on a regular basis risk assessments for credit exposures and overall compliance with policy 
loan and lease portfolio review the corporation s primary credit exposure is focused in its loans and leases portfolio  which totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
in an effort to minimize the adverse impact of any single event or set of occurrences  the corporation strives to maintain a diverse credit portfolio

the allowance coverage of nonperforming loans was percent at december  compared to percent at december  at december   there were no material commitments to lend additional funds with respect to nonperforming loans 
in order to respond when deterioration of a credit occurs  internal loan workout units are devoted to provide specialized expertise and full time management and or collection of certain nonperforming assets as well as certain performing loans 
management believes concerted collection strategies and a proactive approach to managing overall problem assets have expedited the disposition  collection and renegotiation of nonperforming and other lower quality assets 
as part of this process  management routinely evaluates all reasonable alternatives  including the sale of assets individually or in groups  and selects the optimal strategy

allowance for credit losses the corporation performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan and lease portfolios to identify risks inherent in and to assess the overall collectibility of those portfolios 
certain homogeneous loan portfolios are evaluated collectively based on individual loan type  while remaining portfolios are reviewed on an individual loan basis 
these detailed reviews  combined with historical loss experience and other factors  result in the identification and quantification of specific allowances for credit losses and loss factors which are used in determining the amount of the allowance and related provision for credit losses 
the actual amount of incurred credit losses that may be confirmed may vary from the estimate of incurred losses due to changing economic conditions or changes in industry or geographic concentrations 
the corporation has procedures in place to monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred credit losses  which include detailed periodic assessments by senior management of both individual loans and credit portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred credit losses in those portfolios 
portions of the allowance for credit losses  as presented on table thirteen  are assigned to cover the estimated probable incurred losses in each loan and lease category based on the results of the corporation s detail review process as described above 
further assignments are made based on general and specific economic conditions  as well as performance trends within specific portfolio segments and individual concentrations of credit  including geographic and industry concentrations 
the assigned portion of the allowance for credit losses continues to be weighted toward the commercial loan portfolio  reflecting a higher level of nonperforming loans and the potential for higher individual losses 
the remaining unassigned portion of the allowance for credit losses  determined separately from the procedures outlined above  addresses certain industry and geographic concentrations  including global economic conditions  thereby minimizing the risk related to the margin of imprecision inherent in the estimation of the assigned allowance for credit losses 
due to the subjectivity involved in the determination of the unassigned portion of the allowance for credit losses  the relationship of the unassigned component to the total allowance for credit losses may fluctuate from period to period 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses based on the combined total of the assigned and unassigned components and believes that the allowance for credit losses reflects management s best estimate of incurred credit losses as of the balance sheet date 
period to period changes in the assigned allowance for credit losses are driven by portfolio level and product mix changes  specific allowance for credit loss assignments on impaired loans  as well as any changes in assigned levels driven by the review process 
in the first quarter of  a review of the corporation s portfolio and combined loss history resulted in adjustments to selected loss factors  which in some instances were higher or lower than the rates 
this resulted in a redistribution of the allowance between select product categories 
the allowance assigned to commercial domestic loans  commercial real estate domestic loans and direct indirect consumer loans at december  was impacted by this revision of loss factors as well as by portfolio level changes 
the consumer finance loan portfolio experienced a redistribution of portfolio risk in as a result of the sale of a sub prime business in and reductions of manufactured housing exposures in changes in the assigned allowance for credit losses in for all other product categories were commensurate with portfolio level changes 
the level of the unassigned allowance for credit losses remained stable from to  although there was a shift in the mix of the components as certain industry concentration risks  such as healthcare  sub prime finance and textiles and apparel  increased and offshore risk expectations have generally improved

international developments during  and continuing into  a number of countries in asia  latin america and central and eastern europe experienced economic difficulties due to a combination of structural problems and negative market reaction that resulted from increased awareness of these problems 
while each country s situation is unique  many share common factors such as government actions which restrain normal functioning of free markets in physical goods  capital and or currencies  perceived weaknesses of the banking systems  and perceived overvaluation of local currencies and or pegged exchange rate systems 
these factors resulted in capital movement out of these countries or in reduced capital inflows  and  as a result  many of these countries experienced liquidity problems in addition to the structural problems 
more recently  many of the asian economies are showing signs of recovery from prior troubles and are slowly implementing structural reforms 
however  there can be no assurance that this will continue and setbacks could be expected from time to time 
since early  several latin american economies have replaced their pegged exchange rate systems with free floating currencies 
while sustained recovery is not assured  much of latin america is showing signs of recovery 
where appropriate  the corporation has adjusted its activities including its borrower selection in light of the risks and opportunities discussed above 
the corporation continued to reduce its exposures in asia  latin america and central and eastern europe throughout the corporation will continue to monitor and adjust its foreign activities on a country by country basis depending on management s judgment of the likely developments in each country and will take action as deemed appropriate 
market risk management in the normal course of conducting its business activities  the corporation is exposed to market risks including price and liquidity risk 
market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange risk  commodity prices commodity risk and prices of equity securities equity risk 
financial products that expose the corporation to market risk include securities  loans  deposits  debt and derivative financial instruments such as futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the corporation may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or that the corporation may be more reliant on alternative funding sources such as long term debt 
market risk is managed by the corporation s finance committee  which formulates policy based on desirable levels of market risk 
in setting desirable levels of market risk  the finance committee considers the impact on both earnings and capital of the current outlook in market rates  potential changes in market rates  world and regional economies  liquidity  business strategies and other factors 
trading portfolio the corporation manages its exposure to market risk resulting from trading activities through a risk management function which is independent of the various business units 
the trading risk committee trc establishes and monitors various limits on trading activities 
these limits include product volume  gross and net positions  and value at risk var and stress profit and loss simulation limits 
product volume limits establish maximum aggregate amounts of specific types of derivatives  foreign exchange contracts and securities that the corporation may hold in its trading account at any point in time 
position limits restrict the gross and net amount of contracts that can be held in the trading account in any specific maturity and product grouping 
var measures the potential loss in future earnings due to market rate movements within the trading portfolio using proprietary models that are based on statistical probability 
var limits establish the maximum amount of potential loss  based upon sophisticated modeling techniques  that the corporation is willing to assume at any point in time to a certain degree of confidence 
additionally  the corporation uses profit and loss simulations to measure the potential for loss in various segments of the trading portfolio resulting from specific and extremely adverse scenarios 
these scenarios are projected without regard to the statistical probability of their occurrences 
loss simulation limits establish the maximum amount of projected loss computed by the simulation that the corporation is willing to assume 
the corporation reduces the market risk to which it is exposed in the trading account by executing offsetting transactions with other counterparties 
however  the corporation retains open or uncovered trading account positions in an effort to generate revenue by correctly anticipating future market conditions and customer demands or by taking advantage of price differentials among the various markets in which it operates 
the day to day management of interest rate and foreign exchange risks takes place at a decentralized level within the corporation s various trading centers 
limits established by the trc are assigned to each trading center 
in addition  documented trading policies and procedures define acceptable boundaries within which traders can execute transactions in their assigned markets 
the corporation uses a var methodology to measure the interest rate  foreign exchange  commodity and equity risks inherent in its trading activities 
under this methodology  management models historical data to statistically calculate  with percent confidence  the potential loss in earnings the corporation might experience if an adverse one day shift in market prices was to occur 
the corporation performs the var calculation for each major trading portfolio segment on a daily basis 
it then calculates the combined var across these portfolio segments using two different sets of assumptions 
the first calculation assumes that each portfolio segment experiences adverse price movements at the same time ie  the price movements are perfectly correlated 
the second calculation assumes that these adverse price movements within the major portfolio segments do not occur at the same time ie  they are uncorrelated 
trading activities market risk average high low average high low us dollar equivalents in millions var var var var var var based on perfect positive correlation interest rate foreign currency commodities equity based on zero correlation interest rate foreign currency commodities equity the high and low for the entire trading account may not equal the sum of the individual components as the highs or lows of the components occurred on different trading days 
the table above sets forth the calculated var amounts for and the amounts are calculated on a pre tax basis 
interest rate and foreign exchange risks were generally lower in than in due to the decreased emphasis on proprietary risk taking and the establishment of the euro as a currency 
equity risk was generally higher in than in due to growth in the equity business 
var modeling on trading is subject to numerous limitations 
in addition  the corporation recognizes that there are numerous assumptions and estimates associated with modeling and actual results could differ from these assumptions and estimates 
the corporation mitigates these uncertainties through close monitoring and by examining and updating assumptions on an ongoing basis 
the continual trading risk management process considers the impact of unanticipated risk exposure and updates assumptions to reduce loss exposure 
asset and liability management activities non trading portfolio the corporation s asset and liability management alm process is used to manage interest rate risk through the structuring of balance sheet and off balance sheet portfolios and identifying and linking such off balance sheet positions to specific assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk represents the only material market risk exposure to the corporation s non trading on balance sheet financial instruments 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the corporation uses sophisticated computer simulations which determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instruments short term financial instruments  securities  loans  deposits  borrowings and off balance sheet financial instruments 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these scenarios  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed on an ongoing basis by senior management 
additionally  duration and market value sensitivity measures are selectively utilized where they provide added value to the overall interest rate risk management process 
at december   the interest rate risk position of the corporation was relatively neutral as the impact of a gradual parallel basis point rise or fall in interest rates over the next months was estimated to be less than one percent of net interest income 
table eighteen summarizes the expected maturities  unrealized gains and losses and weighted average effective yields and rates associated with the corporation s significant non trading on balance sheet financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents  time deposits placed and other short term investments  federal funds sold and purchased  resale and repurchase agreements  commercial paper  other short term borrowings and foreign deposits  which are similar in nature to other short term borrowings  are excluded from table eighteen as their respective carrying values approximate fair values 
these financial instruments generally expose the corporation to insignificant market risk as they have either no stated maturities or an average maturity of less than days and interest rates that approximate market rates 
however  these financial instruments could expose the corporation to interest rate risk by requiring more or less reliance on alternative funding sources  such as long term debt 
loans held for sale are also excluded as their carrying values approximate their fair values  generally exposing the corporation to insignificant market risk

expected maturities reflect the impact of prepayment assumptions 
excludes leases 
when measuring and managing market risk associated with domestic deposits  such as savings and demand deposits  the corporation considers its long term relationships with depositors 
the unrealized gain on deposits in this table does not consider these long term relationships  therefore only certificates of deposits reflect a change in value 
excludes foreign time deposits 
expected maturities of long term debt and trust preferred securities reflect the corporation s ability to redeem such debt prior to contractual maturities 
excludes obligations under capital leases 
interest rate and foreign exchange contracts risk management interest rate contracts and foreign exchange contracts are utilized in the corporation s alm process 
interest rate contracts  which are generally non leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps  options  futures and forwards allow the corporation to effectively manage its interest rate risk position 
generic interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments based on the contractual underlying notional amount 
basis swaps involve the exchange of interest payments based on the contractual underlying notional amounts  where both the pay rate and the receive rate are floating rates based on different indices 
option products primarily consist of caps and floors 
interest rate caps and floors are agreements where  for a fee  the purchaser obtains the right to receive interest payments when a variable interest rate moves above or below a specified cap or floor rate  respectively 
futures contracts used for alm activities are primarily index futures providing for cash payments based upon the movements of an underlying rate index 
in addition  the corporation uses foreign currency contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign denominated assets and liabilities  as well as the corporation s equity investments in foreign subsidiaries 
foreign exchange contracts  which include spot  futures and forward contracts  represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed upon price  on an agreed upon date 
table nineteen shows the notional amount of the corporation s open interest rate and foreign exchange contracts 
the notional amount of the corporation s receive fixed and pay fixed interest rate swaps at december  was billion and billion  respectively 
the receive fixed interest rate swaps are primarily converting variable rate commercial loans to fixed rate 
the net receive fixed position at december  was billion compared to billion notional at december  the corporation had billion and billion notional of basis swaps at december  and  respectively  linked primarily to loans and long term debt 
the corporation had billion and billion notional of option products at december  and  respectively 
in addition  open foreign exchange contracts at december  had a notional amount of billion compared to billion notional at december  table nineteen also summarizes the estimated duration  weighted average receive and pay rates and the net unrealized gains and losses at december  and of the corporation s open alm interest rate swaps  as well as the average estimated duration and the net unrealized gains and losses at december  and of the corporation s alm basis swaps  options  futures and forward rate and foreign exchange contracts 
unrealized gains and losses are based on the last repricing and will change in the future primarily based on movements in one  three and six month libor rates 
the alm swap portfolio had a net unrealized loss of billion at december  and a net unrealized gain of million at december  the change is primarily attributable to an increase in interest rates 
the alm option products had a net unrealized gain of million at december  compared to a net unrealized loss of million at december  at december  and  open foreign exchange contracts had a net unrealized loss of million and a net unrealized gain of million  respectively 
the amount of unamortized net realized deferred gains associated with closed alm swaps was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the amount of unamortized net realized deferred gains associated with closed alm options was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the amount of unamortized net realized deferred losses associated with closed alm futures and forward rate contracts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
there were no unamortized net realized deferred gains or losses associated with closed foreign exchange contracts at december  and management believes the fair value of the alm interest rate and foreign exchange portfolios should be viewed in the context of the overall balance sheet  and the value of any single component of the balance sheet or off balance sheet positions should not be viewed in isolation
