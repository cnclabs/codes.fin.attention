the discussion of the company s results of operations reported in the consolidated statements of operations compares the years ended december  and  as well as december  and certain comparisons between the periods are made on a percentage basis as well as on a weighted average gross leasable area gla basis  a technique which adjusts for certain increases or decreases in the number of centers and corresponding square feet related to the development  acquisition  expansion or disposition of rental properties 
the computation of weighted average gla  however  does not adjust for fluctuations in occupancy that may occur subsequent to the original opening date

under joint shelf registration  the company and the operating partnership could issue up to million in additional equity securities and million in additional debt securities 
with the decline in the real estate debt and equity markets  the company may not  in the short term  be able to access these markets on favorable terms 
management believes the decline is temporary and may utilize these funds as the markets improve to continue its external growth 
in the interim  the company may consider the use of operational and developmental joint ventures and other related strategies to generate additional capital 
the company may also consider selling certain properties that do not meet the company s long term investment criteria as well as outparcels on existing properties to generate capital to reinvest into other attractive opportunities 
based on cash provided by operations  existing credit facilities  ongoing negotiations with certain financial institutions and funds available under the shelf registration  management believes that the company has access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during during march  the company refinanced its notes that had a carrying amount of million 
the refinancing reduced the interest rate to  increased the loan amount to million and extended the maturity date to april the additional proceeds were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the revolving lines of credit 
in addition  the company extended the maturity of all of its revolving lines of credit by one year 
the lines of credit now have maturity dates in the years and in january  the company entered into a million two year unsecured term loan with interest payable at libor plus 
the proceeds were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the existing lines of credit 
also in january  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements on notional amounts totaling million at a cost of  the agreements mature in january the swap agreements have the effect of fixing the interest rate on the new million loan at 
at december   approximately of the outstanding long term debt represented unsecured borrowings and approximately of the company s real estate portfolio was unencumbered 
the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding on december  was 
the company anticipates that adequate cash will be available to fund its operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations  and the payment of dividends in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and long term 
although the company receives most of its rental payments on a monthly basis  distributions to shareholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior  unsecured notes are made semi annually 
amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the existing lines of credit or invested in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
certain of the company s debt agreements limit the payment of dividends such that dividends will not exceed funds from operations ffo  as defined in the agreements  for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or of ffo on a cumulative basis from the date of the agreement 
market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company negotiates long term fixed rate debt instruments and enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes on its floating rate debt 
the swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments based on a contractual principal amount and time period 
payments or receipts on the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
in june  the company terminated its only interest rate swap agreement effective through october with a notional amount of million 
under this agreement  the company received a floating interest rate based on the day libor index and paid a fixed interest rate of 
upon termination of the agreement  the company received  in cash proceeds 
the proceeds have been recorded as deferred income and are being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the original contract term 
in january  the company entered into new interest rate swap agreements on notional amounts totaling million at a cost of  the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt at december  was million 
a increase from prevailing interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in fair value of total long term debt by approximately million 
fair values were determined from quoted market prices  where available  using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity 
funds from operations management believes that for a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the company  ffo should be considered along with net income as presented in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is presented because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by certain investors and analysts to analyze and compare one equity real estate investment trust reit with another on the basis of operating performance 
ffo is generally defined as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  before extraordinary items and gains losses on sale of depreciable operating properties  plus depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate 
the company cautions that the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity and as such the presentation of ffo by the company may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reporting companies 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of operating performance or to cash from operations as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flows available to fund dividends to shareholders and other cash needs 
below is a calculation of funds from operations for the years ended december   and as well as actual cash flow and other data for those respective years in thousands funds from operations net income    adjusted for extraordinary item loss on early extinguishment of debt minority interest    depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate    gain on disposal or sale of real estate  asset write down  funds from operations before minority interest    cash flow provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    weighted average shares outstanding    for the year ended december   includes  in gains on sales of outparcels of land 
assumes the partnership units of the operating partnership held by the minority interest  preferred shares of the company and share and unit options are all converted to common shares of the company 
in october  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit issued interpretive guidance regarding the calculation of ffo 
nareit s leadership determined that ffo should include both recurring and non recurring operating results  except those results defined as extraordinary items under generally accepted accounting principles and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property 
all reits are encouraged to implement the recommendations of this guidance effective for fiscal periods beginning in for all periods presented in financial statements or tables 
the company intends to adopt the new nareit clarification beginning january  below is a calculation of ffo under the new proposed method as if the company had adopted the method as of january  new proposed method funds from operations net income    adjusted for extraordinary item loss on early extinguishment of debt minority interest    depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate    gain on disposal or sale of real estate  funds from operations before minority interest    new accounting pronouncements during  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires entities to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at their fair value 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of the fasb statement no 
that revises sfas no 
to become effective in the first quarter of management of the company anticipates that  due to its limited use of derivative instruments  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
economic conditions and outlook the majority of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales above predetermined levels  which the company believes often are lower than traditional retail industry standards which generally increase as prices rise 
most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and advertising and promotion  thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
while factory outlet stores continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for brand name manufacturers  some retail formats are more successful than others 
as typical in the retail industry  certain tenants have closed  or will close  certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws 
as part of its strategy of aggressively managing its assets  the company is strengthening the tenant base in several of its centers by adding strong new anchor tenants  such as nike  gap  polo  tommy hilfiger and nautica 
to accomplish this goal  stores may remain vacant for a longer period of time in order to recapture enough space to meet the size requirement of these upscale  high volume tenants 
consequently  the company anticipates that its average occupancy level will remain strong  but may be more in line with the industry average 
approximately of the company s lease portfolio is scheduled to expire during the next two years 
approximately  square feet of space is up for renewal during and approximately  square feet will come up for renewal in if the company were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms  the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
existing tenants sales have remained stable and renewals by existing tenants have remained strong 
approximately  or  of the square feet scheduled to expire in have already been renewed by the existing tenants 
in addition  the company continues to attract and retain additional tenants 
the company s factory outlet centers typically include well known  national  brand name companies 
by maintaining a broad base of creditworthy tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the united states  the company reduces its operating and leasing risks 
no one tenant including affiliates accounts for more than of the company s combined base and percentage rental revenues 
accordingly  management currently does not expect any material adverse impact on the company s results of operation and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released 
year compliance the company did not experience any systems or other year yk problems during january in  the company spent approximately  to upgrade or replace equipment or systems specifically to bring them in compliance with yk 
the company is not aware of any other significant costs to be incurred to address future yk problems 
there are a number of yk related items that may affect the company s results of operations 
for example  the company s spending patterns or cost relationships may have been affected by large yk remediation expenditures or the postponement of certain expenses 
the company s revenue patterns may have been affected by unusual tenant behavior  such as delayed openings or delayed payments of rents until after yk 
in addition  some companies may have postponed information technology projects or other capital spending in preparing for yk which could impact the company s liquidity requirements 
the company has not experienced any of these situations and does not believe that any exist which might materially impact the company s results of operations or liquidity 
the company has third party relationships with approximately tenants and over  suppliers and contractors 
many of these third party tenants are publicly traded corporations and subject to disclosure requirements 
the principal risks to the company in its relationships with third parties are the failure of third party systems used to conduct business such as tenants being unable to stock stores with merchandise  use cash registers and pay invoices  banks being unable to process receipts and disbursements  vendors being unable to supply needed materials and services to the centers  and processing of outsourced employee payroll 
the company s assessment of major third parties yk readiness included sending surveys to tenants and key suppliers of outsourced services including stock transfer  debt servicing  banking collection and disbursement  payroll and benefits 
the majority of the company s vendors are small suppliers that the company believes can manually execute their business and are readily replaceable 
management also believes there is no material risk of being unable to procure necessary supplies and services from third parties who have not already indicated that they are currently yk compliant 
the company received responses to approximately of the surveys sent to tenants  banks and key suppliers 
of the companies who responded  indicated they were presently  or would be by december   yk compliant 
the company is not aware of any significant third parties who are not currently yk compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that all third parties are currently yk compliant and that all will be able to continue to conduct transactions with the company successfully 
there also can be no assurance that yk problems of third parties or of the company s own systems which did not surface in january will not be a problem sometime in the near future
