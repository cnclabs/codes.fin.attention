item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview host marriott corporation a maryland corporation formerly named hmc merger corporation operating through an umbrella partnership structure  is the owner of hotel properties 
we operate as a self managed and self administered reit with our operations conducted solely through an operating partnership and its subsidiaries 
since reits are not currently permitted to derive revenues directly from the operations of hotels  we lease substantially all of the hotels to subsidiaries of crestline capital corporation  crestline  or the lessee  and other lessees 
as of december   we owned  or had controlling interests in  upscale and luxury  full service hotel lodging properties generally located throughout the united states and operated primarily under the marriott  ritz carlton  four seasons  swissotel and hyatt brand names 
most of these properties are managed by marriott international  inc or marriott international 
during  our basic earnings per share before extraordinary items decreased to 
our results benefited from increased hotel sales  offset by the loss on litigation settlement 
we refinanced almost billion of debt with long term fixed rate notes  issued million shares of preferred stock  and implemented a stock repurchase program 
as of december   the refinancing of our debt has resulted in an average interest rate of approximately with of the debt at a fixed rate and an average maturity of approximately eight years with only of our debt maturing in the next two years 
during the third and fourth quarter we received net proceeds of million as a result of the issuance of perpetual preferred stock 
we are focused on carefully using our capital to improve returns to shareholder 
currently our primary use of free cash flow and asset sales proceeds is to repurchase stock under our stock buyback plan  which was announced during the third quarter of based on current market conditions  we believe that the stock repurchase program reflects the best return on investment for our shareholders 
however  we will continue to look at strategic acquisitions as well as evaluate our stock repurchase program based on changes in market conditions and our stock price 
through march   the stock repurchase program has resulted in the retirement of million shares of common stock and million shares of our convertible preferred securities and  operating partnership units  for a total reduction of million equivalent shares on a fully diluted basis for million 
on november   our board of directors announced that terence c 
golden  our president and chief executive officer  will retire effective may   the date of our next annual shareholders meeting 
the board also announced that it has named christopher j 
nassetta  currently our executive vice president and chief operating officer to assume the positions of president and chief executive officer effective on that date 
mr 
golden will remain a member of the board of directors and mr 
nassetta was elected to the board of directors on november  in december  the reit modernization act was passed  effective for taxable years beginning after december   which significantly amends the reit laws applicable to us 
under the reit modernization act  beginning january   we will be able to lease our hotels to a subsidiary of the operating partnership that is a taxable corporation and that elects to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary 
in addition  as a result of passage of the reit modernization act  we have the right to purchase the leases from crestline on or after january   for a price equal to the fair rental value of the lessee s interest in the leases over their remaining terms  excluding any option periods  the amount of which could be significant 
effective november   we amended substantially all of our leases with crestline to give crestline the right to renew each of these leases for up to four additional terms of seven years each at a fair rental value  to be determined either by agreement between us and crestline or through arbitration at the time the renewal option is exercised 
crestline is under no obligation to exercise these renewal options  and we have the right to terminate the renewal options during time periods specified in the amendments 
in addition  the amendments provide that the fair rental value payable by us to crestline in connection with the purchase of a lease as described above does not include any amounts relating to any renewal period 
therefore  the fair rental value of a lease after expiration of the initial term for such lease would be zero 
we intend to evaluate our options regarding the crestline leases and have not yet made a decision whether or not to purchase those leases 
we announced that we and marriott international have executed a definitive settlement agreement to resolve specific pending litigation involving seven limited partnerships 
the proposed settlement would involve an acquisition of the limited partner interests in two partnerships by a joint venture between one of our affiliates and marriott international  and cash payments to partners in the other five partnerships  in exchange for resolution of claims against all defendants in all seven partnerships 
our share of the payment  including the acquisition of two of the partnerships  is expected to be approximately million  excluding related expenses 
the proposed settlement is subject to numerous conditions  including definitive documentation  court approval and various consents  and no assurance can be given that the settlement will occur 
as a result of the proposed settlement  we have recorded a one time non recurring  pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of results of operations our historical revenues have primarily represented gross property level sales from hotels  net gains on property transactions  interest income and equity in earnings of affiliates 
our historical operating costs and expenses have principally consisted of property level operating costs  depreciation  management fees  real and personal property taxes  ground  building and equipment rent  property insurance and other costs 
as of january   we lease substantially all of our hotels to subsidiaries of crestline due to the reit conversion 
as a result of these leases  we no longer record property level revenues and operating expenses  rather we recognize rental income on the leases and specified owner expenses  including real estate and property taxes  property insurance  and ground and equipment related to the properties 
the comparison of the results with and is also affected by a change in the reporting period for our hotels not managed by marriott international 
thus  revenues and expenses are not comparable with prior years 
compared to revenues 
revenues decreased billion  or  to billion for as discussed above  our revenues and operating profit are not comparable to prior years  primarily due to the leasing of our hotels as a result of the reit conversion 
however  gross hotel sales  which is used in the determination of rental income for  increased million or over amounts as is shown in the following table 
the table below represents gross hotel sales generated by the properties for and rental income for is computed based on gross hotel sales 
year ended december  december  in millions hotel sales rooms   food and beverage  other total sales   gross hotel sales do not represent our reported revenues for rather  rental income  which is computed based on gross hotel sales  represents our reported revenues for lodging results for were primarily driven by the addition of properties in the increase in hotel sales also reflects the growth in room revenues generated per available room or revpar 
for comparable properties  revpar increased  to for on a comparable basis  average room rates increased approximately for the year  while average occupancy increased less than one percentage point for the year

as discussed above  hotel revenues and hotel operating costs are not comparable with the prior year 
the lessee pays specified direct property level costs including management fees and we receive a rent payment  which is generally calculated as a percentage of revenue  subject to a minimum level  net of certain property level owner costs 
all of these costs were our expenses in property level owner costs which are comparable  including depreciation  property taxes  property insurance  ground and equipment rent  increased to million for versus  primarily reflecting the depreciation from properties acquired during minority interest 
minority interest expense increased million to million in  primarily reflecting the impact of the issuance of operating partnership units for the acquisition of specified hotel properties partially offset by the consolidation of partnerships which occurred as part of the reit conversion 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in  primarily due to the issuance of senior notes  establishment of a new credit facility and additional mortgage debt on properties acquired in corporate expenses 
corporate expenses decreased million to million in  resulting primarily from lower staffing levels after the crestline spin off  lower costs associated with reduced acquisition activity and lower costs related to various stock compensation plans

average room rates increased nearly for our comparable full service hotels 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  we spun off our senior living communities

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in cash is primarily a result of cash flows used for investing and financing activities  offset by cash provided by operating activities

the source of future cash outflows are dependent on cash from operations and the amount of additional debt  if any  necessary for payment upon the final resolution of these items 
as of december   our total consolidated debt was approximately billion 
our debt is comprised of billion in unsecured senior notes  billion in non recourse mortgage debt and million outstanding under the term loan portion of the billion bank credit facility 
based on our total capitalization of approximately billion as of december  consisting of long term debt  minority interests  mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities  and shareholder s equity  consolidated debt represents of our total capitalization  compared to as of december  since august  we have issued or refinanced more than billion of debt  as is described below  in order to reduce the risk and volatility in our capital structure 
the net effect of these transactions has been to virtually eliminate all of our near term maturities  as less than of our debt matures over the next two years  reduce our average interest rate by approximately basis points  and extend our average maturity by almost one year 
as a result  our average rate is now approximately  and our average maturity is approximately years  with of our debt having fixed interest rates 
significant debt transactions include 
currently  million is outstanding under the term loan portion of the bank credit facility  while the available capacity under the revolving credit portion of the bank credit facility remains at million 
the bank credit facility was originally negotiated in august for billion  and million was subsequently repaid on the term loan during to permanently reduce the total bank credit facility to billion 
the credit facility has an initial three year term with two one year extension options 
borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at the eurodollar rate plus at december   and the interest rate and commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility fluctuate based on specified financial ratios 

we issued million of series d senior notes due in february and used the proceeds to refinance  or purchase  debt which had been assumed through the merger of some partnerships or the purchase of hotel properties in connection with the reit conversion in december we repaid a million variable rate mortgage with a portion of the proceeds  and terminated the associated swap agreement  incurring a termination fee of approximately million

the convertible preferred securities represent an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the trust and  pursuant to various agreements entered into in connection with the transaction  are fully  irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by us

the distribution rate and the distribution and other payment dates for the convertible preferred securities correspond to the interest rate and interest and other payment dates on the convertible subordinated debentures 
we may defer interest payments on the convertible subordinated debentures for a period not to exceed consecutive quarters 
if interest payments on the convertible subordinated debentures are deferred  so too are payments on the convertible preferred securities 
under this circumstance  we would not be permitted to declare or pay any cash distributions with respect to our capital stock or debt securities that rank equal in right of payment with or junior to the convertible subordinated debentures 
subject to certain restrictions  the convertible preferred securities are redeemable at our option upon any redemption of the convertible subordinated debentures after december  upon repayment at maturity or as a result of the acceleration of the convertible subordinated debentures upon the occurrence of a default  the convertible preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption 
during  we repurchased million shares of the convertible preferred securities as part of the stock repurchase plan discussed below 
significant equity financings include 
in september  we announced our intention to repurchase  from time to time  up to million shares of our common stock  operating partnership units or an amount of the convertible preferred securities which are convertible into a like number of shares of our common stock based upon the specified conversion ratio 
as of december   we had purchased approximately million shares of common stock  million shares of the convertible preferred securities and million op units for an aggregate consideration of approximately million 
any repurchases of common stock  operating partnership units  or convertible preferred securities may be effected through open market or privately negotiated purchases  through a tender offer  or through one or more combinations of such methods

in december  we completed the acquisition of  or controlling interests in  twelve world class luxury hotels and certain other assets  including a mortgage note on a thirteenth hotel property from affiliates of the blackstone group 
the operating partnership paid approximately million in cash and assumed debt and issued approximately million op units  along with other consideration for a total value of approximately billion 

in december  subsidiaries of the operating partnership merged with eight public partnerships and acquired limited partnership interests in four private partnerships  which collectively own or control properties of which were controlled by us and consolidated on our financial statements prior to december the operating partnership issued approximately million op units  million of which were subsequently converted to our common stock  for interests in these partnerships valued at approximately million 
as a result of these transactions  the operating partnership increased its ownership of most of the properties to while consolidating additional hotels containing  rooms 

in connection with our conversion to a reit  we formed two non controlled subsidiaries  which own approximately million in assets as of december  the ownership of most of these assets by us and the operating partnership would have jeopardized our status as a reit and the operating partnership s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
these assets primarily consist of partnership or other interests in hotels which are not leased and some furniture  fixtures and equipment used in the hotels 
in exchange for the operating partnership s contribution of these assets to the non controlled subsidiaries  the operating partnership received nonvoting common stock representing of the total economic interests of the non controlled subsidiaries 
the host marriott statutory employee charitable trust  the beneficiaries of which are a trust formed for the benefit of some employees of the operating partnership and the j 
willard marriott foundation  acquired all of the voting common stock representing the remaining of the total economic interests  and reflecting of the control of each non controlled subsidiary 
as a result  as of december   we did not control the non controlled subsidiaries 
ffo and ebitda we consider funds from operations ffo  which represents ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  and our ebitda to be indicative measures of our operating performance due to the significance of our long lived assets 
ffo and ebitda are also useful in measuring our ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures and expand our business 
furthermore  management believes that ffo and ebitda are meaningful disclosures that will help shareholders and the investment community to better understand our financial performance  including comparing our performance to other reits 
however  ffo and ebitda as presented may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other companies 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations  or any other operating or liquidity performance measure prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles 
cash expenditures for various long term assets  interest expense for ebitda purposes only and income taxes have been  and will be incurred which are not reflected in the ebitda and ffo presentation 
ffo increased million  or  to million in over amounts for represent comparative ffo  which equals ffo as defined by nareit plus deferred tax expense

as a result of this reorganization we are the sole general partner in the operating partnership and as of december  held approximately of the outstanding op units 
the million deducted for represents the ffo attributable to the interests in the operating partnership held by those minority partners 
op units owned by holders other than us are redeemable at the option of the holder  generally commencing one year after the issuance of their op units 
upon redemption of an op unit  the holder would receive from the operating partnership cash in an amount equal to the market value of one share of our common stock  or at our option  a share of our common stock

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was to  to  and to in   and  respectively 
partnership activities 
prior to the reit conversion  we had general and limited partner interests in numerous limited partnerships which owned hotels including full service hotels  managed by marriott international 
as a result of the reit conversion  the majority of our interests in the limited service hotels were transferred to the non controlled subsidiaries 
additionally  as part of the reit conversion  of the full service hotels were acquired by the operating partnership  two were sold  four were transferred to one of the non controlled subsidiaries and one was retained by us 
leases 
in addition to our full service hotels  we also lease some property and equipment under noncancelable operating leases  including the long term ground leases for some of our hotels  generally with multiple renewal options 
the leases related to the courtyard properties and residence inn properties sold during and  are nonrecourse to us and contain provisions for the payment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts 
we remain contingently liable on some leases related to divested non lodging properties 
such contingent liabilities aggregated million at december  however  management considers the likelihood of any substantial funding related to these divested properties leases to be remote 
inflation 
our hotel lodging properties have been impacted by inflation through its effect on increasing costs and on the managers ability to increase room rates 
unlike other real estate  hotels have the ability to change room rates on a daily basis  so the impact of higher inflation generally can be passed on to customers 
our exposure to inflation is less now that substantially all of our hotels are leased to others 
almost all of our debt bears interest at fixed rates 
this debt structure largely mitigates the impact of changes in the rate of inflation on future interest costs 
we have some financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the interest recognized on the debt obligations is based on various libor terms  which ranged from to and to at december  and december   respectively 
we repaid a million variable rate mortgage with proceeds from the million senior notes offering discussed in note to the financial statements during the first quarter of we terminated the associated swap agreement incurring a termination fee of approximately million 
in july  we completed the refinancing of approximately million of outstanding variable rate mortgage debt and terminated the related interest rate swap agreements 
as a result of the refinancing we no longer have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
as of december   our remaining variable debt consists of the credit facility and the mortgage debt on the ritz carlton amelia island property which total million  million of which has been repaid subsequent to year end 
accounting standards 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  in december  we changed our method of accounting for contingent rental revenues to conform to the commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
as a result  contingent rental revenue will be deferred on the balance sheet until certain revenue thresholds are realized 
we have adopted sab no 
with retroactive effect beginning january  to conform to the new presentation 
sab no 
has no impact on full year revenues  net income  or earnings per share because all rental revenues considered contingent under sab no 
were earned as of december  the change in accounting principle has no effect on prior years because percentage rent relates to rental income on our leases  which began in in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including specified derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we have not determined the full impact of sfas no 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
expected maturity date fair thereafter total value in millions liabilities long term debt variable the ritz carlton  amelia island credit facility average interest rate interest rates are based on various libor terms plus certain basis points which range from to basis points 
the one month libor rate at december  was 
we have assumed for basis of this presentation that the libor rate remains unchanged 
a basis point increase in libor would increase our interest rate expense by approximately million per year
