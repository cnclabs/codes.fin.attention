on march   we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of adjacency in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
our financial statements have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the acquisition of adjacency  which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
costs  which consist primarily of investment banking  accounting and legal fees related to the acquisition approximated million  have been reflected in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  in september  we commenced a joint venture  sapient cuneo srl  in milan  italy 
the joint venture will provide e services in italy to italian based businesses 
on october   we acquired substantially all of the assets of e 
lab in exchange for  shares of common stock and the assumption of certain liabilities of e 
lab 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
e 
lab s results of operations are included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
on november   we completed a public offering of common stock  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
proceeds to sapient  net of underwriting discounts and costs of the offering  were approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition of adjacency  we assumed the outstanding options granted under the adjacency stock option plan the adjacency plan 
the adjacency plan was originally adopted by adjacency in and provided for the grant of stock options up to an aggregate of  shares of class b common stock of adjacency 
in november  prior to the acquisition  adjacency had granted a total of  options to its employees at exercise prices between and per share 
the shares vested ratably over three years starting on the date of employment  except for certain employees who were granted accelerated vesting upon a change in control of adjacency 
the total compensation charge to be taken over the vesting period is approximately million  resulting from the fact that the options were granted at below fair market value 
the charge in the fourth quarter of of approximately million was the result of certain employees being substantially vested by december  a charge of approximately million in the first quarter of was the result of the change in control provisions 
beyond the first quarter of  we expect the compensation expense to be approximately  per quarter for the next seven quarters 
stock based compensation was approximately million for the year ended december  as a result of the acquisition  we have assumed the obligations related to options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
no further grants may be made pursuant to the adjacency plan  and previously outstanding options remain outstanding  and are exercisable for shares of our common stock 
in connection with the acquisition of studio archetype in the third quarter of  the company allocated million to in process technology and recorded a corresponding income tax benefit of million 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value of such technology based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the development of projects that had not reached technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition and with respect to which the in process research and development had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  this allocation was charged to expense as of the acquisition date 
the company allocated values to the acquired in process research and development projects by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established  including development  engineering and testing activities associated with the introduction of studio archetype s next generation enterprise wide suite of development  scheduling  bug tracking and content management applications 
the integrated solution is comprised of the following technologies content management systems cms  an intranet  an extranet  an issues server and an on line user interface lab ui lab which together allow developers and clients to access prototypes and trial deliverables and fully integrates user interface tools with client server  advanced database and legacy systems 
the cms  intranet and extranet components of the system were released in june the ui lab was completed in march and the issue server was completed in september the integrated solution is a comprehensive enterprise scale system 
all components of the in process r d project acquired by us with the acquisition of studio archetype are presently being piloted on several client projects with the anticipation of rolling out the integrated  enterprise wide solution in at the time of the acquisition  expenditures on these projects were approximately million  and estimated costs to complete these projects were expected to total approximately  the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products and services principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies met their design specifications including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
the efforts to develop the purchased in process technology also included testing of the technology for compatibility and interoperability with other applications 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting them to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by studio archetype and its competitors 
we did not experience any material variations in costs to complete or completion dates from our initial assumptions 
following the acquisition of studio archetype  studio archetype was fully integrated into our operations  making the isolation of specific revenues attributable to the in process technologies difficult 
however  nothing has occurred to materially change our expectations with respect to the underlying assumptions used in projecting the expected future revenues associated with this in process r d 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects  discount rates of to percent were utilized for the business enterprise and for the in process research and development 
the company believes that these discount rates were commensurate with studio archetype s stage of development  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and the uncertainty of future technological advances at that time

in addition  we have a bank revolving line of credit providing for borrowings of up to million 
borrowings under this line of credit  which expires on june   bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
the line of credit includes covenants relating to the maintenance of certain financial ratios and limits the payment of dividends 
at december   the company had no bank borrowings outstanding and no material capital commitments 
we invest predominantly in instruments that are highly liquid  investment grade securities and have maturities of less than one year 
at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  this resulted primarily from net income of million  non cash charges of million  increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and accrued compensation of million and increases in accrued income taxes payable of million  principally due to the overall growth of the company  offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and increases of million in unbilled revenues on contracts due to increases in revenue 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  this was due primarily to purchases of short term investments net of maturities during the period of million  which resulted primarily from the investment of the proceeds from a public stock offering  and also by capital expenditures of million due to significant expansion of the company s office space and computer equipment purchases 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and was principally due to proceeds from a public stock offering of million 
also  cash of million was provided from the sale of common stock through the company s employee stock purchase plan and upon exercise of stock options 
we believe that the cash provided from operations  borrowings available under our revolving line of credit  existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
year readiness the following disclosure shall be considered year readiness disclosure to the maximum extent allowed under the year information and readiness disclosure act 
we developed a phased year readiness plan to help identify and resolve year issues associated with our internal systems  external vendors and the services provided by us 
in december  we completed our assessment of our internal and third party computer systems and our internal non information technology systems  such as building security  voice mail  telephone and other systems containing embedded microprocessors 
our material internal information technology systems consist principally of financial  accounting and human resources application software created by third parties  and internally developed sales forecasting and project management software applications 
all of our internally developed applications are year compliant 
with respect to the third party software applications  we believe that  based on oral statements made by manufacturers and or statements published on manufacturers websites  that such products are year complaint 
at the manufacturer s recommendation  we recently installed patches in our versions of the windows and windows nt operating systems in order for those operating systems to become year compliant 
the manufacturers of our computer hardware platforms  principally servers  have indicated that the versions we currently use are year compliant 
we also completed a comprehensive contingency plan in december to address the situations that may result if we were unable to achieve year readiness of our major information technology and non information technology systems 
to date  including since january   we have not experienced any material malfunctions or interruptions with our internal computer systems or our internal non information technology systems as a result of the year issue 
we have not experienced any material interruptions resulting from the computer systems of third parties with which we do business  such as landlords  telecommunications companies  banks  utilities and commercial airlines 
we also have no knowledge of any material malfunctions or interruptions caused by the year issue in the business solutions we have designed  developed and implemented for our clients 
there can be no assurance that any such malfunctions or interruptions will not arise in the future  and the future occurrence of any such malfunctions or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our most reasonably likely worst case scenario for year problems would be a the postponement of client projects while clients respond to their own year problems  b having to rely on manual internal operational capabilities  or c having to defend a number of year lawsuits from our clients 
if our clients experience year problems  we may be precluded from continuing to provide services for these clients until their problems are resolved 
additionally  if clients year problems affect their accounting systems  this could result in delayed payment of our invoices 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement was amended by the issuance of sfas  deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which changed the effective date of sfas to all fiscal years beginning after june  fiscal for the company and requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if so  the type of hedge transaction 
management of the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or its results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we have any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments which would require disclosure under this item
