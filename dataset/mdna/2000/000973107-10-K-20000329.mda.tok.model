item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this annual report on form k  including the following discussion  contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of any statements in this annual report on form k that are not statements of historical facts are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including under year readiness disclosure statement and cautionary statements 
overview we are a leading provider of value added electronics manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers oems in the networking and telecommunications  computer and industrial and medical equipment markets 
we provide oems with complex printed circuit board assembly  primarily utilizing advanced surface mount technology  electro mechanical sub assembly  total system assembly and integration  and mechanical and molded cable and harness assembly 
we target and have developed a particular expertise in serving emerging and established oems who require moderate volume production runs of complex  leading edge commercial market applications 
these applications are generally characterized by multiple configurations and high printed circuit board densities 
as a result  they generally require technologically advanced and flexible manufacturing as well as a high degree of other value added services 
as an integral part of our offerings to customers  we provide the following value added services new product introduction services  advanced manufacturing and test engineering  flexible materials management  comprehensive test services  product diagnostics and repair  packaging  order fulfillment and distribution services 
we currently manufacture at ten facilities having an aggregate of approximately million square feet 
of our leased manufacturing facilities  five of the facilities are located in massachusetts and one facility is located in each of santa clara  california  lawrenceville  georgia  corinth  mississippi  and dublin  ireland 
we also own a acre tract of land and a  square foot manufacturing facility on that property in hermosillo  mexico 
all of our manufacturing facilities have been certified to the iso international quality standard  except our corinth  mississippi facility which has been certified to the iso international quality standard 
we commenced operations in a  square foot  newly leased facility in massachusetts in the first quarter of this new facility has not been certified to the iso or international quality standards  although we expect that it will be certified in the near future 
we have signed a lease for a new  square foot facility in san jose  california that is under construction 
we plan to move our existing santa clara operations and the equipment and assets we purchased from gss array to this new facility and expect to begin operations in this new facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal our facilities contain surface mount technology lines 
we recognize revenue upon shipment to customers or otherwise  under certain contracts  when title to and reward of ownership pass to the customer 
we generally do not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments from our customers 
instead  we work closely with our customers to anticipate delivery dates and future volume of orders based on customer forecasts 
the level and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to 
customer attempts to manage inventory  
changes in the customer s manufacturing strategy  and 
variation in demand for customer products due to  among other things  introduction of new products  product life cycles  competitive conditions or industry or general economic conditions 
we may purchase components for product assemblies based on customer forecasts 
our policy is that customers are generally responsible for materials and associated acquisition costs in the event of a significant reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from the forecasted amounts 
recent and pending business and asset acquisitions on march   we entered into a pre tender agreement for the acquisition of gss array technology public company limited gss thailand  a thailand company publicly traded on the stock exchange of thailand 
under the terms of the agreement  gss thailand would be delisted from the stock exchange of thailand and we would then make a cash tender offer for all issued shares and outstanding options of gss thailand for approximately million at the exchange rate in effect between the thai baht and the us dollar on march  we also have the option to make the cash tender offer prior to the delisting of gss thailand from the stock exchange of thailand 
holders of approximately of gss thailand s outstanding shares have agreed to tender their issued shares and outstanding options to act 
we expect to close the acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal  however  the acquisition is subject to various regulatory approvals and other closing conditions 
we cannot assure you that these closing conditions will be satisfied  and we therefore may not consummate this acquisition of gss thailand on a timely basis or at all 
on october   we acquired certain inventory and fixed assets of gss array technology  inc  located in san jose  california  for approximately million in cash and the assumption of million in liabilities  which we financed primarily from our bank credit facility 
the purchase of these assets did not constitute the acquisition of a business 
gss array technology  inc was a subsidiary of gss thailand 
we have assumed on going relationships with select gss array domestic customers and hired select employees 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
on july   we completed our merger with cmc industries  inc  a provider of electronics manufacturing services to oems in the telecommunications  computer and electronics industries 
cmc operated manufacturing facilities in santa clara  california  corinth  mississippi and hermosillo  mexico 
as a result of the merger  cmc became our wholly owned subsidiary 
under the terms of the merger agreement  each share of cmc common stock was exchanged for of a share of our common stock and all cmc stock options were assumed by us 
we issued approximately million shares of common stock  and reserved approximately million shares of common stock for future issuance under cmc s equity incentive plan  pursuant to the merger 
the merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been restated to include the operating results and financial position of cmc at the beginning of the earliest period presented 
act prepares its consolidated financial statements on the basis of a fiscal year ending december and cmc prepared its consolidated financial statements on the basis of a fiscal year ending july the consolidated statements of operations  comprehensive income loss and cash flows for the years ended december  and referred to as fiscal and reflect the results of operations  comprehensive income loss and cash flows for act for the years then ended combined with the results of operations and cash flows for cmc for the years ended july  and the consolidated balance sheet as of december  reflects the financial position of act as of that date combined with the financial position of cmc as of july  the consolidated statements of operations data  comprehensive income loss and the consolidated balance sheet data as of december  reflect the results of operations and financial position of act and cmc for the year then ended 
as a result of act and cmc having different fiscal years  cmc s condensed consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the five month period from august  through december  are reported separately in this annual report on form k 
the consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the conforming of cmc s accounting policy with that of act s by expensing previously capitalized preoperating and start up costs associated with cmc s mexican manufacturing facility 
the adjustment also gives effect to the tax deductibility of these expenses 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in june  we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of electronic systems international  located in georgia  a provider of electronics manufacturing services to oems based primarily in the southeastern united states 
we issued  shares of our common stock  valued at that time at approximately million  to purchase the esi business 
in  we also acquired advanced component technologies limited formerly signmax limited  located in dublin  ireland  a provider of electronics manufacturing services primarily consisting of cable and harness assembly 
we acquired this business for approximately million in cash and assumed liabilities 
we have since expanded our manufacturing facility in ireland to include a printed circuit board operation utilizing primarily surface mount technology 
the operating results of these acquired businesses are included from the dates of purchase in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales for each period indicated 
the table and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
fiscal year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses merger costs operating income interest and other expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss we provide electronics manufacturing services to customers in the networking and telecommunications  computer and industrial and medical equipment markets 
the percentage of net sales by market for fiscal  and is as follows percentage of net sales market networking and telecommunications computer industrial and medical fiscal compared to fiscal our net sales increased million or to million in fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was attributable to an expansion of business in our printed circuit board assembly service offering of million  of which approximately million resulted from the gss array acquisition 
approximately million of the net increase was from new customers and the remainder was due to increased business from existing customers 
net sales in the printed circuit board assembly service offering  including value added services such as systems integration  test  repair and order fulfillment  as a percentage of net sales was approximately and in fiscal and  respectively 
net sales in our cable and harness assembly service offering accounted for approximately and in fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit increased million or to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to growth in sales volume  an increase in sales with higher margins and an increase in absorption of overhead in our mexican facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million compared with million for fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to from in fiscal sg a expenses increased primarily to support the larger revenue base and anticipated revenue growth 
merger costs of million related to the july  merger with cmc industries were recorded in fiscal these merger costs consisted primarily of investment banking  legal  accounting  printing  integration and other fees and expenses directly related to the merger 
operating income increased million to million  or of net sales  compared with operating income of million  or of net sales  for fiscal as a result of the above factors 
interest and other expense  net increased million to million compared to million for fiscal the increase was due to higher average working capital requirements resulting in higher average loan balances in fiscal  higher interest rates during fiscal and interest on capital leases entered into in fiscal we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the fiscal effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the effects of non deductible merger costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal our net sales increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was attributed principally to an expansion of printed circuit board assembly business from existing and new customers 
customers representing or more of our net sales in fiscal were nortel networks and micron electronics as compared to nortel networks in fiscal net sales in the printed circuit board assembly product line  including system integration  test  repair and order fulfillment  as a percentage of net sales was approximately in each of fiscal and fiscal net sales in the cable and harness assembly product line accounted for approximately of net sales in each of fiscal and fiscal gross profit increased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal within fiscal  gross margin was   and in the first  second  third and fourth quarters 
this sequential improvement was due primarily to the positive impact of our cost management programs and a favorable product mix offset in part by an increase in costs of materials as a percentage of cost of goods sold in our mississippi operation 
in addition  fiscal gross profit was impacted by a charge relating to an inventory shortfall identified at the end of fiscal of approximately million which was included in cost of goods sold  and by the effect of a  write off of certain inventory balances to cost of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal sg a expenses in fiscal included a million charge for defense and settlement of certain claims of age discrimination resulting from a september workforce reduction at cmc 
without admitting any liability  cmc agreed to enter into a conciliation agreement with the eeoc to settle claims related to this matter and limit future litigation costs 
sg a expenses in fiscal included a bad debt reserve of million for terminated customers and  for costs of investigating the inventory shortfall 
although sg a expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased in absolute dollars in fiscal primarily due to our increase in net sales 
operating income increased million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with operating income of  in fiscal as a result of the previously discussed factors 
interest and other expense  net decreased  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease resulted principally from reduced average borrowings on our credit facilities and lower average interest rates in fiscal compared to fiscal we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal compared to a benefit for income taxes of million in fiscal the effective income tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the tax benefit was provided at primarily due to the effects of non deductible expenses and the differences in pre tax income earned in various jurisdictions in which we do business 
cmc results of operations for the five months ended december  for the five months ended december   cmc generated gross profit of million on total net sales of million 
the gross margin of was lower than cmc s historical gross margin primarily because of the loss of two customers  micron electronics and global village communications  offset by net sales to new customers and expanded business with existing customers at lower margins 
gross profit was also adversely affected by increases in manufacturing overhead costs incurred in anticipation of higher sales volumes and inefficiencies associated with the initiation of new manufacturing projects 
the net loss for the five months ended december  of million did not include any one time  non recurring charges 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million at december  compared with million at december  operating activities used million of cash in fiscal compared with cash provided by operations of million in fiscal the primary use of cash by operating activities for fiscal was an increase in both inventory and accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
inventory increased million to million and accounts receivable increased million to million  while accounts payable increased million to million  as of december  these increases in inventory and accounts payable are the result of continued sequential quarterly revenue growth  purchasing strategies to prevent shortages of key components and reflect inventory requirements to support first quarter customer demand 
the increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to sales revenue generated later in the fourth quarter of than in the fourth quarter of fiscal on july   we announced that we had executed an amended and restated credit agreement for a new million senior secured credit facility with a group of banks led by the chase manhattan bank as agent to replace our previous credit facilities with the banks 
this new credit facility provides for a million  five year term loan and a million five year line of credit  both of which are secured by substantially all of our assets 
at december   million of the credit facility was utilized and an additional million was available for use based upon the applicable borrowing base and the full term loan was utilized 
at december   the interest rate on the million term loan was  the rate on million of the line of credit was and the rate on the remainder of the line of credit was 
the term loan amortizes at a rate of million per year for the first year and million per year for years two through five 
we made million in principal payments on the million term loan in fiscal the credit facility also provides for borrowings up to an aggregate amount of million  limited to a percentage of qualified accounts receivable and qualified inventory 
interest is payable monthly 
for the term loan  we may choose an interest rate of either above the prevailing london interbank offering rate libor  or above the prime rate as announced by the agent 
for the revolving credit facility  we may choose an interest rate of either above the prevailing libor rate  or above the prime rate as announced by the agent 
in addition to certain other prohibited actions  the credit facility limits our capital expenditures and prohibits the payment of cash dividends on our common stock 
the credit facility also requires us to maintain certain minimum fixed charge coverage ratios and maximum leverage ratios 
we received net proceeds of million from the sale of our common stock in fiscal on november   we sold  shares of our common stock in a public offering 
net proceeds of million from this sale were principally used to reduce our indebtedness under our bank credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
the remaining million of net proceeds from the sale of our common stock were primarily the result of the exercise of employee stock options 
we are a party to a million interest rate swap in order to fix the interest rate on a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility 
the swap agreement provides for payments by us at a fixed rate of interest of and matures on october  the fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was approximately  since the fixed rate of was higher than the floating rate 
the swap agreement was terminated on march  capital expenditures of million for fiscal were primarily for the acquisition of equipment related to operations 
we lease a manufacturing facility and certain equipment and computer software used in our manufacturing operations under capital lease agreements that expire through during the first quarter of  we refinanced approximately million of our then existing operating leases and classified these leases as capital leases in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for fiscal the effect of this refinancing on our results of operations will not differ materially from the previous lease financing arrangements 
at december   we had equipment lease lines of approximately million available for purchases of manufacturing equipment  computer hardware and software and furniture 
we sold  shares of common stock of eon communications formerly cortelco  a related party  for net proceeds of approximately million in the first quarter of the accounting for the gain on the sale of the eon investment will be recorded in the fiscal financial statements 
our need for  cost of and access to funds are dependent in the long term on our future operating results as well as conditions external to us 
we may require additional capital to finance further acquisitions or other enhancements to or expansions of our manufacturing capacity 
although no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be available on terms satisfactory to us  we may seek additional funds from time to time through public or private debt or equity offerings  or through further bank borrowings or through equipment lease financing 
we believe that our current sources of liquidity are adequate to support our anticipated liquidity needs for the next twelve months 
newly issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  amended in june and effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the new standard requires that all companies record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
our management is currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
we will adopt this accounting standard on january   as required 
year readiness disclosure statement we have not experienced any material disruption in our operations as a result of the year issue  although it is possible that we could still experience such a disruption 
we incurred approximately  in costs in assessing and correcting our internal hardware  software  equipment and embedded technology 
we used our working capital and available lease lines to fund our year project costs 
cautionary statements the private securities litigation reform act of the act contains certain safe harbors regarding forward looking statements 
from time to time  information we provide or statements made by our employees may contain forward looking information 
any statements in this annual report on form k that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements 
in some cases you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will  and would or other similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future  expectations  contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or state other forward looking information 
the following cautionary statements should be considered carefully in evaluating our business 
the factors discussed in these cautionary statements  among other factors  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
these cautionary statements are being made pursuant to the provisions of the act and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
risks related to acquisitions we may not close the acquisition of gss thailand 
the closing of the acquisition of gss thailand is subject to various closing conditions including  among other things 
the occurrence of all necessary government approvals  filings and registrations  
the shareholders of gss thailand voting in favor of the delisting of the ordinary shares from the stock exchange of thailand and the transferability of the outstanding options to act  based on act s obligation to make the tender offer  
gss thailand obtaining a waiver from the board of investment relating to its factory premises at ayudhaya  
no material breach of the pre tender offer agreement before the launching of the tender offer  
no material adverse change in the business  condition financial or otherwise or results of operation of gss thailand and or reduction in the value and or assets of gss thailand excluding changes occasioned by i events affecting the contract electronic manufacturing industry as a whole and ii fluctuations in the baht us dollar exchange rate  prior to the launch of the tender offer by act  and 
no proposal or offer for a tender offer for the shares of gss thailand which is publicly announced and  in the judgment of the board of directors of gss thailand  would result in a transaction more favorable to the shareholders than the act offer  which causes gss thailand s board to withdraw or adversely modify its recommendations to the shareholders and optionholders for the delisting of the shares and the acceptance of the tender offer 
if the stock exchange of thailand accepts the delisting application of gss thailand  we will be required to commence our tender offer for all issued shares and outstanding options of gss thailand at the price per share set forth in the pre tender agreement  and may not terminate our offer or lower the purchase price based on adverse developments in the business  condition or results of operations of gss thailand or otherwise 
as part of the pre tender agreement  holders of approximately of gss thailand s outstanding shares agreed to tender their shares and options in act s tender offer 
however  we cannot assure you that these closing conditions will be satisfied or that we will consummate the acquisition of gss thailand on a timely basis or at all 
even if we consummate the gss thailand acquisition  we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
additional benefits from the merger with cmc industries may not occur 
we completed the merger with cmc industries with the expectation that the merger would result in certain benefits  including 
the opportunity to generate revenue from new customers that require an electronics manufacturing services provider to have a minimum size and geographic coverage  
opportunities to increase revenues from our current customers by providing a lower cost alternative and a broader geographic presence  
operating efficiencies such as combined managerial  sales  marketing and technological expertise and personnel  and 
other synergies due to the strategic fit and compatibility of the two companies  including their common equipment platforms and information systems 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger 
integrating cmc s operations and personnel with our business has been and continues to be a complex and difficult process 
achieving the benefits of the merger will depend upon the successful integration of cmc s business in an efficient and timely manner 
the integration of cmc with our operations could require additional costs and expenses as well as demands on management personnel 
the diversion of the attention of our management and any difficulties encountered in the process of combining our companies could cause the disruption of  or a loss of momentum in  our activities 
we may fail to make additional acquisitions and may not successfully integrate acquisitions we do make  which could impair our ability to compete and our operating results 
in light of the consolidation trend in our industry  we intend to pursue selective acquisitions of additional electronics manufacturing services providers  facilities  assets or businesses 
we may compete for acquisition opportunities with entities having significantly greater resources than us 
as a result  we may not succeed in acquiring some or all of the companies  facilities  assets or businesses that we seek to acquire 
failure to consummate additional acquisitions may prevent us from accumulating sufficient critical mass required by customers in this consolidating industry 
this failure could significantly impact our ability to effectively compete in our targeted markets and could negatively affect our results of operations 
moreover  acquisitions that we do complete may result in 
the potentially dilutive issuance of common stock or other equity instruments  
the incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  or 
the incurrence of significant costs and expenses 
acquisition transactions  including our pending acquisition of gss thailand  also involve numerous business risks  including 
difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations  technologies  personnel and products  
difficulties in managing geographically dispersed and international operations  
the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  
the potential disruption of our business  and 
the potential loss of key employees 
risks related to our operations our business may suffer if the networking and telecommunications segments of the electronics industry fail to grow and evolve 
our customer base has historically been concentrated in a limited number of segments within the electronics industry 
net sales to customers within the networking and telecommunications segments accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal developments adverse to these industry segments could materially and negatively impact us 
these industry segments  and the electronics industry as a whole  experience 
intense competition  
rapid technological changes resulting in short product life cycles and consequent product obsolescence  
significant fluctuations in product demand  
economic cycles  including recessionary periods  and 
consolidation 
a recessionary period or other event leading to excess capacity affecting one or more segments of the electronics industry we serve would likely result in intensified price competition  reduced margins and a decrease in our net sales 
the loss of major customers could adversely affect us 
we depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our business 
our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal for fiscal  each of nortel networks formerly bay networks and aptis communications and s incorporated formerly diamond multimedia accounted for or more of our net sales and  respectively 
customers representing or more of our net sales in fiscal were nortel networks and micron electronics  each with approximately  as compared to nortel networks with of our net sales in fiscal the timing and level of orders from our customers varies substantially from period to period 
the historic level of net sales we have received from a specific customer in one particular period is not necessarily indicative of net sales we may receive from that customer in any future period 
our results may depend on our ability to diversify our customer base and reduce our reliance on particular customers 
our major customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels or at all 
in particular  we terminated our business with ascend  which was acquired by lucent technologies  in the fourth quarter of fiscal and we experienced a significant decrease in sales to micron in the third quarter of fiscal for various reasons  including consolidation in our customers industries  we have in the past and will continue in the future to terminate or lose relationships with customers 
we may not be able to expand our customer base to make up any sales shortfalls from our major customers so as to increase overall net sales 
because certain customers represent such a large part of our business  any of the following could negatively impact our business 
the loss of one or more major customers  
a significant reduction or delay in purchases from any major customer  
discontinuance by any major customer of the sale of products we manufacture  
a reduction in demand for the products of major customers that we manufacture  or 
the inability or unwillingness of a major customer to pay for products and services on a timely basis or at all 
our customers do not enter into long term purchase orders or commitments  and cancellations  reductions or delays in customer orders would adversely affect our profitability 
the level and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to 
customer attempts to manage inventory  
changes in the customers manufacturing strategy  such as a decision by a customer to either diversify or consolidate the number of electronics manufacturing services providers used or to manufacture their products internally  and 
variation in demand for customer products 
we generally do not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments from our customers 
instead  we work closely with our customers to anticipate delivery dates and future volume of orders based on customer forecasts 
we rely on our estimates of anticipated future volumes when making commitments regarding 
the levels of business that we will seek and accept  
the timing of production schedules  
the purchase of materials  
the purchase or leasing of facilities and equipment  and 
the levels and utilization of personnel and other resources 
customers may cancel  reduce or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated for a variety of reasons 
significant or numerous terminations  reductions or delays in our customers orders could negatively impact our operating results 
we often purchase components for product assemblies based on customer forecasts  at times without a written customer commitment to pay for them 
our policy is that customers are generally responsible for materials and associated acquisition costs in the event of a significant reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from the forecasted amounts 
a customer s unwillingness or inability to reimburse us for materials costs in the case of a significant variance from forecast could adversely affect our operating results 
increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our services 
the electronics manufacturing services industry is highly competitive 
we compete against numerous us and foreign electronics manufacturing services providers with global operations  as well as those who operate on a local or regional basis 
in addition  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally 
consolidation in the electronics manufacturing services industry results in a continually changing competitive landscape 
the consolidation trend in the industry also results in larger and more geographically diverse competitors who have significant combined resources with which to compete against us 
some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial  manufacturing  engineering  technical  financial  systems  sales and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may 
respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  
have greater name recognition  critical mass and geographic and market presence  
be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities  
adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements  and 
devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their services 
we may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to manufacturers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers  distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures 
our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection  and companies with greater resources or a greater geographic and market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us 
increased competition from existing or potential competitors could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share 
we may not be able to obtain raw materials or components for our assemblies on a timely basis or at all 
we rely on a single or limited number of third party suppliers for many proprietary and other components used in the assembly process 
we do not have any long term supply agreements 
shortages of materials and components have occurred from time to time and will likely occur in the future 
in particular  we are currently experiencing a shortage in components such as tantalum and ceramic capacitors  flash memory  and dynamic and static ram 
raw materials or component shortages could result in shipping delays or increased prices which could adversely affect our ability to manufacture products for our customers on a timely basis or at acceptable cost 
moreover  the consolidation trend in our suppliers industry results in changes in supply relationships and in the price  availability and quality of components and raw materials 
due to our utilization of just in time inventory techniques  the timely availability of many components is dependent on our ability to both develop accurate forecasts of customer requirements and manage the materials supply chain 
if we fail to do either  our operating results may suffer 
operating in foreign countries exposes us to increased risks 
we acquired in fiscal  and then subsequently expanded in fiscal  operations in dublin  ireland 
as a result of our merger with cmc  we acquired operations in hermosillo  mexico and a procurement office in taiwan 
we may in the future expand into other international regions 
we have limited experience in managing geographically dispersed operations and in operating in europe  mexico or asia 
we also purchase a significant number of components manufactured in foreign countries 
because of the scope of our international operations  we are subject to the following risks which could materially impact our results of operations 
economic or political instability  
transportation delays and interruptions  
foreign exchange rate fluctuations  
increased employee turnover and labor unrest  
longer payment cycles  
greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  
utilization of different systems and equipment  
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel and diverse cultures  and 
less developed infrastructures 
in addition  changes in policies by the us or foreign governments could negatively affect our operating results due to 
increased duties  
increased regulatory requirements  
higher taxation  
currency conversion limitations  
restrictions on the transfer of funds  
the imposition of or increase in tariffs  or 
limitations on imports or exports 
also  we could be adversely affected if our host countries revise their current policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade 
our business could suffer if we lose the services of  or fail to attract  key personnel 
our future success largely depends upon the skills and efforts of john a 
pino  chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  our other key executives and our managerial  manufacturing  sales and technical employees 
with the exception of jack o rear  vice president of operations  and a small number of sales people  we have not entered into employment contracts or noncompetition agreements with any of our senior management or other key employees 
we do not maintain or plan to acquire any key man life insurance on any of our key personnel 
the loss of services of any of our executives or other key personnel could negatively affect our business 
our continued growth will also require us to attract  motivate  train and retain additional skilled and experienced managerial  manufacturing  sales and technical personnel 
we face intense competition for such personnel 
we may not be able to attract  motivate and retain personnel with the skills and experience needed to successfully manage our business and operations 
we may not be able to maintain our technological and manufacturing process expertise 
the markets for our manufacturing services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development 
the continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to 
maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  
develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs  and 
successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies  equipment and processes currently required by our customers  we cannot be certain that we will develop capabilities required by our customers in the future 
also  the emergence of new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment  inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive 
the acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment 
our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements would have an adverse effect on our business 
we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 
we are subject to environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  site cleanup  and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
if we fail to comply with present and future regulations  or are required to perform site remediation  we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
present and future regulations may also 
restrict our ability to expand our facilities  
require us to acquire costly equipment  or 
require us to incur other significant costs and expenses 
products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects which could result in reduced demand for our services and liability claims against us 
we manufacture products to our customers specifications which are highly complex and may at times contain design or manufacturing errors or failures 
defects have been discovered in products we manufacture in the past and  despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts  defects may occur in the future 
defects in the products we manufacture  whether caused by a design  manufacturing or component failure or error  may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders 
if these defects occur in large quantities or too frequently  our business reputation may also be impaired 
in addition  these defects may result in liability claims against us 
risks related to our expansion our operating results will depend on our ability to manage our growth 
we have grown rapidly in recent years and we expect to continue to expand our operations 
this growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant strain on our management  operations  technical  financial  systems  sales  marketing and other resources 
for example  we identified a significant inventory shortfall occurring in the fourth quarter of fiscal that substantially adversely affected our operating results for that period 
as a result of this shortfall  we reviewed and continue to review our security procedures and operating and financial controls 
based upon such review  we implemented enhanced security systems and inventory work in process tracking systems 
these systems may not be adequate or have the intended results 
we also implemented various cost management programs to enhance our profitability 
these programs may not result in the anticipated cost savings  however 
we will have to continue to invest in both our manufacturing infrastructure to expand capacity and our operational  financial  and management information systems 
if we fail to manage our expected growth effectively  the quality of our services and products and our operating results could suffer significantly 
expansion of our operations may negatively impact our business 
we may expand our operations by establishing or acquiring new manufacturing facilities or by expanding capacity in our current facilities 
we may expand both in geographical areas in which we currently operate and in new geographical areas within the united states and internationally 
we have recently begun operations in a new facility in massachusetts and have signed a lease for a new facility in california which is currently under construction and which will enable us to consolidate and expand our operations 
we expect to begin operations in this new california facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal we may not be able to find additional suitable facilities on a timely basis or on terms satisfactory to us 
expansion of operations involves numerous business risks  including 
the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or capacity and to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value  
difficulties in the timing of expansions  including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing plans  
the diversion of management s attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of expansions  
the strain placed on our operational  financial  management  technical and information systems and resources  
disruption in manufacturing operations  
the incurrence of significant costs and expenses  and 
the inability to locate enough customers or employees to support the expansion 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if the revenues associated with new or expanded facilities are not sufficient to offset the increased expenditures associated with the expansions 
we may fail to secure necessary additional financing 
we have made and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures to expand our operations and remain competitive in the rapidly changing electronics manufacturing services industry 
our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support our continued growth and operations 
we may seek to raise capital by 
issuing additional common stock or other equity instruments  
issuing debt securities  
obtaining additional lease financings  
increasing our lines of credit  or 
obtaining off balance sheet financing 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital when we want or need it  and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms 
if we issue additional equity securities or convertible debt to raise capital  it may be dilutive to your ownership interest 
furthermore  any additional capital may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business  such as financial or operating covenants 
risks related to our common stock we anticipate that our net sales and operating results will fluctuate which could affect the trading price of our common stock 
our net sales and operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
a substantial portion of our net sales in a given quarter may depend on obtaining and fulfilling orders for assemblies to be manufactured and shipped in the same quarter in which those orders are received 
further  a significant portion of our net sales in a given quarter may depend on assemblies configured  completed  packaged and shipped in the final weeks of such quarter 
in addition to the variability resulting from the short term nature of our customers commitments  the following factors may contribute to such fluctuations 
fluctuations in demand for our services or the products we manufacture  
shipment delays  
interruptions in manufacturing caused by earthquakes or other natural disasters  
effectiveness in controlling manufacturing costs  
changes in cost and availability of labor and components  
inefficiencies in managing inventory and accounts receivable  including inventory obsolescence and write offs  and 
the levels at which we utilize our manufacturing capacity 
our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  any unanticipated shortfall in revenue in a quarter would likely adversely affect our operating results for that quarter 
also  changes in our product assembly mix may cause our margins to fluctuate which could negatively impact our results of operations for that period 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
it is likely that in one or more future periods our results of operations will fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  and the price of our common stock could decline significantly 
we may incur costs and liability related to potential or pending litigation 
on february   our company and several of our officers and directors were named as defendants in a purported securities class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts 
the plaintiffs amended the complaint on october  the plaintiffs purport to represent a class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock in the period from april  through march  the amended complaint alleges  among other things  that the defendants knowingly made misstatements to the investing public about the value of our inventory and the nature of our accounting practices 
on december   we filed a motion to dismiss the case in its entirety based on the pleadings 
our motion to dismiss was granted without prejudice on may   and the case was closed by the court on june  on june   the plaintiffs filed a motion with the court seeking permission to file a second amended complaint 
we opposed that motion 
on july   the court denied the plaintiffs motion to amend  noting final judgment having entered in the case 
on july   the plaintiffs filed a motion with the court asking the court to extend the day period for filing an appeal of its ruling dismissing the case 
we opposed that motion as well  and the court denied the motion on august  the plaintiffs have filed an appeal with the united states court of appeals for the first circuit requesting that the court of appeals reverse each of the orders described above 
the parties are currently briefing the issues before the court of appeals 
we believe the claims asserted in this action and the plaintiffs pending appeal are without merit and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this action 
however  a material adverse judgment in such matter could cause our financial condition or operating results to suffer 
in december  cmc industries retained the services of a consultant to assist in quantifying the potential exposure to cmc in connection with clean up and related costs of a former manufacturing site 
this site is commonly known as the itt telecommunications site in milan  tennessee 
the consultant initially estimated that the cost to remove and dispose of the contaminated soil would be approximately  cmc subsequently entered into a voluntary agreement to investigate the site with the tennessee department of environment and conservation 
in addition  cmc agreed to reimburse a tenant of the site  for expenditures previously incurred to investigate environmental conditions at the site 
cmc recorded a total provision of  based on these estimates 
in fiscal  an environmental consultant estimated that the cost of a full study combined with short and long term remediation of the site may cost between and million 
subsequent environmental studies done in fiscal have estimated such costs as between  and million 
during cmc s fiscal  the state of tennessee s department of environment and conservation named certain potentially responsible parties in relation to the former facility 
cmc was not named as a potentially responsible party 
however  alcatel  inc  a potentially responsible party named by the state of tennessee s department of environment and conservation and a former owner of cmc  sought indemnification from cmc under the purchase agreement by which cmc acquired the stock of one of the operators of the facility 
to date  alcatel has not filed any legal proceedings to enforce its indemnification claim 
however  alcatel could initiate such proceedings and other third parties could assert claims against us relating to remediation of the site 
we have entered into an agreement with alcatel pursuant to which the statute of limitations on its indemnification claim is tolled for a period of time 
in the event any proceedings are initiated or any claim is made  we would defend ourselves vigorously but defense or resolution of this matter could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
john a 
pino has significant influence over our company 
john a 
pino  chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  and a number of trusts for his and his family s benefit  collectively beneficially owns approximately of our common stock 
as a result  mr 
pino is able to exert significant influence over us through his ability to influence the election of directors and all other matters that require action by our stockholders 
the voting power of mr 
pino and these trusts could have the effect of preventing or delaying a change in control of our company  which mr 
pino opposes even if our other stockholders believe it is in their best interests 
the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
from october  through march   our stock price has fluctuated between a low of per share and a high of per share 
on march   the closing price for our common stock was 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of events and factors relating to our company  our competitors and the market for our services  many of which are beyond our control  such as 
quarterly variations in our operating results  
announcements of new technological innovations  equipment or service offerings by us or our competitors  
announcements of new products or enhancement by our customers  
changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  and 
news relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
recently  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
we have been the subject of such a lawsuit 
if any of our stockholders brought another securities class action lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial additional costs defending that lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management and an adverse judgment could cause our financial condition or operating results to suffer 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire our company  and this could depress the trading price of our common stock 
massachusetts corporate law and our articles of organization and by laws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company or our management 
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions 
authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock  which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by our board of directors without prior stockholder approval  with rights senior to those of common stock  
provide for a staggered board of directors  so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors  
require unanimity for stockholder action by written consent  and 
establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange primarily in our cash  debt and foreign currency transactions 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we have a million senior secured credit facility which bears interest at variable interest rates 
we have a million interest rate swap agreement which matures in october in order to reduce the impact of fluctuating interest rates on our credit facility 
this swap agreement is classified as held for purposes other than trading 
under this swap agreement  we have agreed with the counterpart to pay fixed rate payments on a monthly basis  based upon an annual interest rate of  in exchange for receiving variable rate payments on a monthly basis  calculated on an agreed upon notional amount 
net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swaps are recorded as adjustments to interest expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations 
the swap agreement was terminated on march  our exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from the variable rate on the remainder of our credit facility 
as of december   million of the outstanding balance of million under the credit facility was at a rate of and the remainder of the credit facility was at an interest rate 
based on the portion of this balance in excess of million  an adverse change of one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
the foreign currencies to which we have exchange rate exposure are the irish punt and the mexican peso 
international operations do not currently constitute a significant portion of our net sales or net assets 
therefore this exposure is not considered material to us 
based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of the risk sensitive financial instruments and cash flows are immaterial 
however  the actual effects of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
