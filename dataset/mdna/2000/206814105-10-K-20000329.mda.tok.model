item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview during  cone mills had lower operating results as the company implemented a comprehensive restructuring program  and the industry in general was negatively impacted by a number of internal and external factors 
the economic slowdown in asian and latin american countries resulted in worldwide supply and demand imbalances in garments and fabrics 
foreign mills were forced to produce and export to the us at depressed prices 
the result has been intensified foreign competition and depressed pricing which severely impacted the us industry s earnings and stock prices 
large us apparel fabric producers generally had poor operating results in the company encountered depressed market conditions in denim fabrics during resulting in a significant reduction of sales in the third and fourth quarters 
retail sales of denim garments showed a slight decrease for lower denim fabric sales resulted primarily from a stronger consumer interest in khakis  inventory adjustments by retailers and wholesalers of brands  and the continued worldwide over capacity in denims even as several competitors exited the us market 
in addition  the trend to baggier silhouettes negatively impacted us mills 
the resulting increase in sewing complexity and requirements for better needle capability favored low cost asian producers 
the company has experienced severe price pressure reflecting these conditions  and throughout  operating schedules at the denim manufacturing plants were curtailed to control inventories 
in early  the company began to see some improvements in denim market conditions that should benefit us mills 
notably  more denim is being shown in certain product lines and there appears to be a shift of fashion back to basic five pocket jeans 
the company continued to encounter manufacturing difficulties at its carlisle finishing plant through the first nine months of however  in the fourth quarter  carlisle benefited from cost reductions associated with its restructuring 
the facility improved capacity utilization with a broadened customer base  improved efficiency and quality  and earned a small operating profit 
the consolidation of the company s granite finishing operations into carlisle that began in disrupted manufacturing efficiencies to a greater extent than anticipated  which materially adversely impacted results of the commission finishing segment during and during  the company ceased production of yarn dyed products and liquidated associated inventories 
adverse market conditions increased import penetration of yarn dyed products  and ineffective marketing and merchandising programs resulted in significant operating losses 
following unsuccessful attempts to make use of the salisbury yarn dyed plant profitably  the company closed this facility in the second quarter of in response to business conditions for apparel products and commission finishing  the company implemented a comprehensive downsizing and reorganization program in  which included the streamlining of product offering of the sportswear division including the closing of the salisbury plant which produced yarn dyed shirting fabrics 
the downsizing and reorganization of the corporate administrative staff 
the merger of the denim and sportswear fabrics businesses into one unit 
the reduction of the manufacturing staff to simplify the management structure 
the closing of the florence and cliffside ring spun yarn manufacturing facilities  coupled with the outsourcing of yarn to reduce operating costs and conserve capital which would have been required for equipment modernization 
the restructuring of the carlisle plant reducing the workforce by approximately  increasing efficiencies and quality  and refocusing of marketing activities 
the exit of the chamois flannel shirting product line with the restructuring of carlisle 
the company expects to achieve on an annual basis over million of cost savings as a result of these initiatives 
the company restructured its decorative fabrics operations in  which included the consolidation of cone jacquards and john wolf divisions  reductions of staff and overhead  and the development of a new management team 
the decorative fabrics units made progress in by broadening their product lines and customer bases as well as expanding capacity 
significant factors that influence the company s operating results and financial condition include general business cycles  consumer fashion preferences  changes in demand for print fabrics  international trade conditions  rising market interest rates as well as the terms on which debt financing is available to the company 
management also believes that one of the most significant factors affecting operating margins is the price of cotton  which varied between the 
s and 
s through much of  and the company has purchased cotton at fixed prices for delivery throughout the company expects average cotton prices to be lower than levels because of the lower cotton market in general and payments to be received under the us government cotton program
