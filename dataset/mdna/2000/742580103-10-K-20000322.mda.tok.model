overall summary in the company experienced significantly increased competition for platesetter sales 
the primary competitors offer similar  although largely less capable  platesetters at considerably lower prices made possible by the bundling of lucrative long term supplies purchase agreements 
the company found itself at a competitive disadvantage since it did not yet have the ability to sell and bundle competitive supplies for its line of platestream platesetters 
the company defined supplies as plate material  liquid chemistry  and other various consumables used in platesetters 
equipment is defined as all revenues other than supplies 
the company s introduction of its silverstream brand supplies in the fourth quarter of did not have a material revenue impact in due to the long sell cycle of platesetters

research and development r d r d expenses in decreased  or from  which in turn showed a decrease of  or from the decreased expenses in were due to reduced design activity compared to prior years completion of the design of key platestream models 
the decrease was partially offset by software development to enable future web to press product offerings

income tax benefit the company recorded income tax benefits of   and  in   and  respectively 
the tax benefits were due to reductions of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets relating primarily to its net operating losses incurred prior to at december  there is no valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset as management believes that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized in the future 
net income net income was  compared to million in and million in the decrease in was mostly due to the decrease in revenues and interest income  to excess parts inventory write downs  and to increased investment spending in marketing and sales to expand platestream silverstream sales in and beyond

outlook the company foresees the positive impact of silverstream supplies in and beyond will facilitate a renewed growth in its equipment and supplies revenues 
success of platestream sales is seen as central to the company s future revenues and profitability 
the growing platestream installed base will also generate growing aftermarket silverstream supplies and service revenues 
the company plans over the next several years to continue to significantly increase its investment spending to expand platestream distribution  and to add new products using incremental innovation 
the company will continue aiding platestream and platejet sales by offering attractive leases that leverage the company s strong balance sheet 
the resulting sales type leases will be recognized as revenue as if purchases had occurred  with the interest received over the multi year leases recognized as operating revenues
