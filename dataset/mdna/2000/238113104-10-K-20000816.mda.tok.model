excluding the special items  net earnings and diluted earnings per share was million or per diluted share in fiscal and million or per diluted share in fiscal sales of the cardiac assist monitoring products segment in fiscal increased to million 
cardiac assist sales of cardiac assist products increased to million in fiscal due to the contribution of newly introduced products the profile fr 
intra aortic balloon catheter and the system balloon pump 
worldwide market acceptance of both of these products continued strong 
patient monitoring patient monitoring product sales increased to a record million  due primarily to shipments of the new passport tm  the company s next generation portable bedside monitor  which was introduced in international markets in the second quarter 
the market launch of the passport in the us followed receipt of k clearance from fda in the third quarter and resulted in a strong ramp up of shipments in the fourth quarter 
sales of the new accutorr r plus blood pressure monitor continued to grow at a double digit rate 
sales of the collagen products vascular grafts segment increased in fiscal to million 
collagen products sales of vasoseal r arterial puncture sealing devices increased to a record million from million last year 
the business continued to benefit from solid market growth  higher average selling prices and increased sales force productivity 
vasoseal es  the company s second generation product  which was introduced worldwide in the first quarter  continued to grow strongly 
during the fourth quarter  vasoseal es sales rose to about of worldwide vasoseal sales 
sales of hemostats were not significant 
vascular grafts international sales of intervascular inc  which account for over of its total sales  increased due to continued strong demand for new products  particularly the intergard r silver  the world s first anti microbial vascular graft 
total sales of intervascular rose only to million as the company s us distributor reduced inventories  resulting in a sharp decline in domestic sales 
genisphere life science research products sales of genisphere products in fiscal were not significant 
the genisphere business continued to implement its revised market entry strategy  which was announced last year 
genisphere is now focusing on developing dna based products to improve the performance of newly developing technologies for drug discovery used by the pharmaceutical and biotech industries 
investment spending for the development of the genisphere business was approximately million in fiscal the stronger us dollar compared to major european currencies decreased consolidated sales by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal costs and expenses the gross profit percentage was for fiscal compared to last year  with the benefit of increased sales of higher margin products being offset by lower average selling prices for certain patient monitoring products 
research and development r d expenses declined in fiscal compared to fiscal because of cost savings from the restructuring program implemented in the second half of last year and lower development expenses in the patient monitoring product line 
as a percentage of sales r d expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased in fiscal compared to last year primarily as a result of the expansion of the us vasoseal field force  increased selling and marketing expenses related to higher sales  introduction of new products and higher corporate expenses 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the stronger us dollar compared to major european currencies decreased sg a expenses by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income interest income for fiscal of million increased million or compared to fiscal the increased interest income in fiscal was attributable to a increase in the average investment portfolio from million to million and an increase in the average yield to from 
income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the tax rate in both years was lower than the federal statutory tax rate primarily as a result of o the tax benefit from the foreign sales corporation o earnings in an international tax exempt industrial zone o interest income exempt from federal income tax 
the higher tax rate in fiscal compared to last year was due mainly to the impact of higher earnings taxed at a higher statutory tax rate  expiration of a tax exemption for a manufacturing subsidiary in europe during fiscal and a lower r d tax credit resulting from reduced r d spending  partially offset by the favorable impact from a higher state net operating loss carryforward utilization 
we operate a manufacturing subsidiary in an industrial development zone in europe 
profits from those manufacturing activities were exempt from corporation taxes until january  alternative tax planning strategies have been implemented to reduce the impact of the expiration of this tax exemption 
net earnings net earnings were million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share last year 
the increase was attributable to o sales growth 
o a more profitable product mix 
o cost savings from the restructuring program implemented in the second half of fiscal o special items fiscal gain on sale of technology of million after tax  compared to a special charge of million for restructuring in fiscal excluding the special items recorded in fiscal and fiscal  net earnings were million or per diluted share compared to million  or per diluted share last year 
foreign currency due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize net earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions which are primarily related to certain receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging activities do not subject us to exchange rate risk because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the liabilities and transactions being hedged 
a portion of the net foreign transaction gain or loss is reported in our statement of consolidated earnings in cost of sales and the balance in other income and expense 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as of june   we had a notional amount of million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  all of which were in european currencies 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed months and require us to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity  at rates agreed to when the contract is signed 
comparison of results fiscal vs 
fiscal sales sales of the cardiac assist monitoring products segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cardiac assist sales of cardiac assist products in fiscal increased over fiscal to million  a reversal of the negative or substantially flat comparisons of the previous two years 
renewed sales growth is attributed to worldwide customer response to our two major new cardiac assist products the profile fr 
intra aortic balloon introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the system balloon pump introduced in the first quarter of fiscal sales in the united states increased over fiscal as the business expanded its market share in each of the last three quarters of fiscal international sales grew over fiscal primarily attributable to increased sales to the european direct markets 
patient monitoring sales of patient monitoring products increased over fiscal to million 
the increase was produced by higher sales of visa central station monitors and of several new patient monitoring products introduced in fiscal including the expert tm and accutorr r plus 
while sales of passport monitors declined for the year because of lower sales during the first nine months  passport shipments increased in the fourth quarter approximately both units and dollar sales driven  in part  by year compliance programs 
sales of the collagen products vascular grafts segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal collagen products sales of vasoseal devices rose in fiscal to a record million reflecting o vigorous growth of the arterial puncture sealing market o excellent clinical performance of the vasoseal r vhd product o expansion of the direct sales and clinical support organization in the united states 
vasoseal r es  our second generation product  was launched in the first quarter of fiscal and is expected to complement the vhd product and strengthen vasoseal s competitive position 
sales of hemostats were not significant 
vascular grafts sales of intervascular  inc s vascular grafts in fiscal increased to million 
in the second half of the year  sales increased approximately over the comparable six month period last year  driven by sales of new products  including the heparin coated graft  the improved woven graft and the intergard r silver  the world s first anti microbial vascular graft which was launched in europe during the fourth quarter 
in addition  higher sales in fiscal benefitted from shipments to intervascular s us distributor  which more than doubled compared to the prior year 
genisphere life science research products there were no sales of genisphere products in fiscal and spending for the development of the genisphere business was million in fiscal our decision to revise the market entry strategy for genisphere s proprietary dna technology was based on the following conclusions o our attempt to capture a significant share of the academic research market for southern and northern blots  as originally planned  would be too costly and time consuming 
o instead  we are now focusing on developing dna based products to improve the performance of newly developing technologies for drug discovery used by the pharmaceutical and biotech industries 
in this market  use of new research technologies occurs much faster and potential customers are more highly concentrated and easier to reach 
o the first genisphere products aimed at the drug discovery market are fluorescent probes designed to improve the detection sensitivity and reliability of microarrays 
this is a new research tool whose use is growing rapidly 
o because the new market entry strategy does not contemplate near term sales until the fluorescent probe products are launched  we suspended manufacturing of our dna reagent and we are using our existing inventory 
the foreign exchange rate effect of the weaker us dollar compared to major european currencies increased consolidated sales by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal costs and expenses cost of sales as a percentage of sales remained unchanged at in fiscal the favorable effect of increased sales volume of higher margin products and increased average selling prices for vasoseal were offset by lower average selling prices for older patient monitoring and cardiac assist products 
research and development r d expenses declined in fiscal compared to fiscal because of lower development expenses in the cardiac assist and patient monitoring product lines  partially offset by increased expenses for the development of second and third generation vasoseal products 
as a percentage of sales r d expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the expansion of the us vasoseal selling and clinical organization  filling open sales and clinical positions in the patient monitoring and cardiac assist sales forces and higher corporate expenses 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the weakening of the us dollar compared to major european currencies increased sg a expenses by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal restructuring charge during fiscal we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of million  equivalent to million after tax or per diluted share 
based on a review by senior management of all company operations in the first half of fiscal  a restructuring plan was approved to reduce our cost structure and streamline certain operations 
the cost reduction programs and related restructuring charges consist of the following o lease termination costs and asset writedowns related to the closing of intervascular s clearwater  florida leased manufacturing facility in order to reduce costs and centralize operations in one expanded facility in la ciotat  france 
the asset writedowns relate primarily to research and production equipment and leasehold improvements that will be removed from service and disposed 
the assets have no salvage value 
o employee severance expenses related to workforce reductions and closing of the clearwater facility 
approximately of the terminated employees left by june  the balance of the employees received notification prior to year end and will be leaving over the next months 
the employee terminations were primarily in administrative  r d and manufacturing positions 
the annual cost savings for the workforce reduction is approximately million 
the workforce reduction did not have any significant impact on our operations 
o writedown of certain genisphere fixed assets based on the revised market entry strategy for the proprietary dna technology 
under the revised market entry strategy we will focus product development on improving the performance of newly developing technologies for drug discovery used by the pharmaceutical and biotech industries 
no significant additional expenditures are anticipated to complete the restructuring program 
interest income interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the lower interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to a million decrease in the average investment portfolio and a decline in the average yield to from 
the decline in the average investment portfolio was caused primarily by o cash used for stock repurchase programs million o increased capital expenditures million  primarily attributable to million for the new patient monitoring facility in mahwah  new jersey o increased inventory to support new products million 
income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the tax rate in both years was lower than the federal statutory tax rate primarily as a result of o the tax benefit from the foreign sales corporation o earnings in an international tax exempt industrial zone o interest income exempt from federal income tax 
the higher tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal was due mainly to the impact of higher earnings taxed at a higher statutory tax rate and a lower r d tax credit resulting from reduced r d spending 
we operate a manufacturing subsidiary in an industrial development zone in europe 
profits from those manufacturing activities were exempt from corporation taxes until january  net earnings net earnings were million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to million or per diluted share in fiscal with the increase in earnings driven by the strong sales growth in all product lines 
impacting net earnings in fiscal was a restructuring charge of million after tax or per diluted share see restructuring charge above 
excluding restructuring charges  net earnings in fiscal were million or per diluted share compared to million in the prior year  or per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at june  was million compared to million and the current ratio was compared to last year 
working capital was impacted primarily by increases in accounts payable and accrued compensation related to higher sales and earnings 
in fiscal cash provided by operations was million  attributable to higher net earnings  depreciation and amortization and increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities was million  attributable to the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment  primarily for the new patient monitoring and collagen products facilities in mahwah  new jersey  and a million equity investment in amg  and an allied company 
net cash used in financing activities was million  attributable to stock repurchases of million and million dividends paid  offset by million cash received from exercise of stock options 
in fiscal cash provided by operations was million  attributable to net earnings and depreciation and amortization  partially offset by increased accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  attributable to the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment  including million for the new patient monitoring facility in mahwah  new jersey  and purchases of marketable securities  offset by maturities of marketable securities

in fiscal cash provided by operations was million 
cash was used to purchase million of equipment and to purchase million of our stock under the stock repurchase program 
the company purchased about  of its common shares for approximately million during fiscal year under both the million share repurchase program authorized in august and the million share repurchase program authorized in september  the august program was completed in september and a balance of about million remains available under the existing share repurchase program 
we believe our financial resources are sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements 
the moderate rate of current us inflation has not significantly affected the company 
year readiness starting in fiscal we commenced a program to identify  remediate  test and develop contingency plans for the year issue in our computer information systems cis  products  vendors  suppliers and customers 
as of august   we had not experienced any year problems regarding our computer information systems  products  vendors  suppliers or customers that caused disruptions in any of our business operations 
the cost to modify the computer software programs used in our cis was covered by existing service agreements with the software vendors 
the assessments  testing and verification of our cis products was performed by existing staff and no significant outside resources were required 
despite the use of internal resources for the year program  there was no significant deferral of other cis projects 
we do not anticipate that any remaining cost for the year program will be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
euro conversion as part of the european economic and monetary union emu  a single currency euro will replace the national currencies of most of the european countries in which we conduct our business

the cost of software and business process conversion is not expected to be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
statement concerning forward looking information this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties because of the possibility that market conditions may change  particularly as the result of competitive activity in the cardiac assist and other markets served by the company  the company s ability to gain market acceptance for new products and the company s dependence on certain suppliers for patient monitoring and vasoseal products 
additional risks are the ability of the company to successfully introduce new products  continued demand for the company s products generally  the rapid and significant changes that characterize the medical device industry and the ability to continue to respond to such technological changes  the uncertain timing of regulatory approvals  as well as other risks detailed from time to time in documents filed by datascope with the securities and exchange commission
