item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the sections entitled business and risk factors  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we disclaim any intent or obligation to update these forward looking statements 
overview we were established in we develop  manufacture and market rapid  accurate and cost effective diagnostic products that improve the quality of patient care and simplify the practice of laboratory medicine 
our two product platforms are designed to provide rapid results through either qualitative visual readings or quantitative meter readings 
in  we launched our first qualitative platform product  the triage doa panel 
in  we began selling two additional qualitative platform products  the triage c 
difficile panel and the triage parasite panel 
also  in  we launched our first quantitative platform product  the triage cardiac system 
we followed these product launches with the introduction of our second quantitative platform product  the triage bnp system  in certain international countries in december we market our products worldwide primarily through distributors supported by our direct sales force 
our principal markets are hospital laboratories  emergency departments and other point of care locations 
in addition to focusing our attention on commercial activities associated with these products  we continue to invest in the research and development of additional rapid tests designed to aid in the diagnosis of several critical diseases or conditions in four core areas cardiovascular  cerebrovascular  infectious diseases and oncology 
our sales to date have primarily been attributed to sales of the triage doa panel product line 
the triage doa panel products are marketed pursuant to exclusive distribution agreements in the us hospital market segment by fisher  which accounted for of product sales in  and internationally by country specific and regional distributors 
since the launch of the triage doa panel in fiscal  we experienced continued revenue growth from our triage doa panel product line 
the growth in sales of triage doa panel products has slowed and we believe it may decline as the available us market becomes saturated and competitive pressures become more and more prominent in a maturing market 
we returned to operating profitability during the third and fourth quarters of however  we incurred an operating loss during the prior seven quarters 
we may not be able to maintain operating profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future and our operating results may not be consistent with predictions made by securities analysts 
we anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including whether and when new products are successfully developed and introduced by us market acceptance of current or new products manufacturing inefficiencies progress of research and development projects including clinical trials and regulatory delays seasonal customer demand  the timing or cancellation of significant orders  product recalls and shipment problems changes in reimbursement policies competitive pressures on average selling prices changes in the mix of products sold operating results would also be adversely affected by a downturn in the market for our current and future products 
we continue to increase our operating expenses  primarily for personnel  capital equipment and activities supporting newly introduced products and new product development 
our operating results would be adversely affected if our net sales or gross profit did not correspondingly increase or if our product development efforts were unsuccessful or are subject to delays 
our limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
we may not sustain revenue growth or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
recent developments new products new product sales of the triage cardiac system and the triage microbiology panels were approximately million in the triage cardiac system is the first product line of our new quantitative measurement product platform 
sales of the triage cardiac system totaled approximately million in during the first quarter of  we experienced manufacturing inefficiencies related to the production of the triage cardiac system 
we addressed those issues  initiated a focused factory approach and reorganized our manufacturing operations to better suit the two different product platforms 
the manufacturing costs of the triage cardiac system improved significantly during the last three quarters of  which resulted in corresponding increases in the gross margin of that product 
in december  we began initial shipments of our second quantitative platform product  the triage bnp system  to certain international customers 
the triage bnp system is a rapid  quantitative diagnostic test that may aid in the diagnosis of congestive heart failure  chf  and therefore potentially enable earlier therapeutic intervention 
additionally  we filed a pre market approval application pma with the fda  seeking approval to market the triage bnp test in the united states 
at the present time  in the united states  there is no blood test available to aid in diagnosing chf 
on march   the fda clinical chemistry and clinical toxicology device panel advisory panel recommended not to approve our pma for the triage bnp test 
in voting  the advisory panel indicated the need for additional data  including data concerning people in higher age groups that do not have chf 
despite this outcome  we continue to believe in the potential utility  safety and effectiveness of the triage bnp test 
we will work with the fda to answer any questions they may have 
we intend to submit an amendment to our pma application if we develop the additional data requested by the fda 
we will continue to market the triage bnp test internationally 
biosite discovery program in march  we introduced our biosite discovery program  a collaborative research and diagnostics development program focused on the identification of new protein markers for acute diseases 
we use our expertise in antibody development to help pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners accelerate their research programs 
in return  we obtained and seek to continue to obtain diagnostic rights to the proteins under study 
we utilize our proprietary omniclonal tm antibody development technology to develop high affinity antibodies for the characterization and validation of protein targets 
initially  we focused on disease target markers in four core areas cardiovascular  cerebrovascular  infectious diseases and oncology 
if the diagnostic utility of a marker is established  it will then be assessed for commercialization potential  with high value markers being added to our product development pipeline 
we have executed collaborative agreements under the biosite discovery program with several partners in the areas of cardiovascular  cerebrovascular  infectious disease and oncology 
results of operations the following table sets forth operating data as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development defense of patent matters total operating expenses income from operations other income  net reacquisition of distribution rights income before benefit provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the growth in net sales of new products 
the triage c 
difficile panel and triage parasite panel were launched in march and october  respectively 
the triage cardiac system was introduced in may new product sales for were approximately million  as compared to million for net sales of the triage doa panel for were higher than net sales of the product for growth in sales of the triage doa panel products has slowed and we believe it may begin to decline as the available us market becomes saturated and competitive pressures become more prominent in a maturing market 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the overall sales growth and the realization of higher gross margins in as compared to for our newer products 
the overall gross margin decreased to for from for the overall gross margin for decreased primarily as a result of a greater proportion of net sales representing the newer products  which experienced lower gross margins than the triage doa panel 
also  during the first quarter of  we experienced significant inefficiencies related to the production of the triage cardiac system  resulting in negative gross profits related to that product during that quarter 
gross margins increased to profitable levels during the remaining quarters of  primarily as a result of efficiencies achieved in the manufacturing operations 
as a result of efficiencies achieved  we were able to utilize some of our manufacturing resources for new product scale up and validation activities related to the triage bnp and triage lbp tests  two products under development 
the costs of new product scale up and validation activities were charged to research and development expenses  contributing to higher gross margins during the remaining quarters of our newer products are expected to continue to realize lower gross margins than the triage doa panel during the early stages of their commercialization as incremental manufacturing costs are spread over smaller sales volumes and efficiency issues are addressed 
we also expect that the overall gross margins will continue to decrease as a result of competitive pricing pressures related to the maturing triage doa product line and the changing mix of net sales of products with different gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in increases in sg a expenses were primarily associated with additional marketing activities relating to new products  the expanded sales activities related to our broader product lines and the increased administrative costs to support our expanded operations and business development activities 
additionally  sg a expenses for included administrative costs associated with the reorganization of our manufacturing operations totaling approximately  and costs related to a business development opportunity that we decided to forego totaling approximately  we expect selling  general and administrative costs in to be significantly higher than in  as we continue to expand our overall operations  including sales and marketing activities for our new products  business development activities and administrative support functions 
the timing of such increased expenditures and their magnitude are primarily dependent on the commercial success and sales growth of our new products and the progress of business development activities 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in significant manufacturing scale up and validation expenses were incurred during related to the triage cardiac system and triage microbiology panels 
the triage cardiac system was the first product on our new quantitative product platform and required significant investments in the scale up and validation of its manufacturing and quality processes 
manufacturing scale up and validation expenses decreased during the decreases in manufacturing scale up and validation costs were offset by increases in other product development expenses 
during  our research and development resources were focused primarily on the development  clinical studies  manufacturing scale up and validation of products under development  potential improvements to our existing products and research activities associated with the biosite discovery program 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in  as compared to levels 
the increased expenditures are expected to primarily relate to pre clinical and clinical studies  product development efforts  the biosite discovery program and manufacturing scale up activities 
the costs associated with the clinical trials are expected to be significant 
some of our potential products are subject to more complex regulatory approval requirements than our previous products 
the timing of the increased expenditures and their magnitude are primarily dependent on the progress and success of the research and development and the timing of potential product launches 
defense of patent matters 
legal expenses associated with the dade behring and spectral diagnostics litigation totaled million in in february  a settlement agreement was executed that resolved all disputes between spectral diagnostics and us without a material adverse financial impact to us 
in march  to avoid protracted litigation and continued significant legal defense costs  we executed a settlement agreement with dade behring that resolved all disputes outstanding between the companies 
accordingly  all settlement costs were known prior to filing our form k and therefore were expensed as of december  other income expenses 
interest and other income decreased to million in from million in interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from the lower average balance of cash and marketable securities and lower overall interest rates on marketable debt securities during as compared to contract revenue decreased to  in from million in contract revenues recognized during related to activities associated with a research and development feasibility study being performed by us and research and development activities related to the biosite discovery program 
in  we recognized million from kyoto dai ichi kagaku c  ltd 
kdk related to milestones achieved in the development of the triage cardiac system  million from novartis related to milestones achieved in the development of the neoralchek system and  related to an sbir small business innovation research grant from the us government for research related to potential microbiology products 
benefit provision for income taxes 
for and  as a result of the pre tax income loss and the estimated tax credits generated in each year  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of  and million  respectively 
the benefit for income taxes recognized in the fourth quarter of included  of benefit resulting from the recognition of research and development credits generated during the first three quarters of recognition of these credits had been deferred until management determined that their realization had become more likely than not 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
the realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income of approximately million 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of our net deferred tax assets 
if future events occur which do not make the realization of such assets more likely than not  a valuation allowance will be established against all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets 
years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the introduction of new products in and the continued market acceptance of our higher priced triage doa plus tca panel products 
net sales for the products introduced in totaled approximately million 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in primarily as a result of experiencing negative gross profits related to the new products introduced in the overall gross margin decreased to for from for the gross margins decreased during the year primarily as a result of the introduction of the triage c 
difficile and parasite panels and triage cardiac system 
during  we experienced manufacturing scale up and capacity constraint issues related to the triage cardiac system that resulted in a backlog of orders during the fourth quarter that was filled by february selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increases resulted primarily from the cost of our expanded sales force  increased marketing activities associated with new products and potential new products  and the expansion of administrative functions to support our expanded operations and business development activities 
additionally  our expended efforts related to transitioning our product distribution in europe from e 
merck to a network of regional distributors 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in although manufacturing scale up and optimization expenses were significantly higher in than  the timing of clinical trials and other product development expenses in resulted in an overall decrease in research and development expenses as compared to there were significant product development activities associated with the triage cardiac system in the fourth quarter of defense of patent matters 
in  we recorded a charge of approximately million associated with the defense and settlement of two separate patent litigations 
settlement agreements were executed during the first quarter of that resolved both matters 
under the terms of the dade behring agreement  we obtained a license to the patent and provided dade behring the option to evaluate certain proprietary antibodies  resulting in a net payment of  to dade behring by biosite 
we charged to defense of patent matters in the statements of operations the applicable license costs related to years prior to of  other income 
contract revenue increased million in from million to million 
in  we recognized million from kdk related to milestones achieved in the development of the triage cardiac system  million from novartis related to milestones achieved in the development of the neoralchek system and  related to an sbir small business innovation research grant from the us government for research related to potential microbiology products 
in  we recognized  from merck related to the development of the triage cardiac system and  from novartis related to milestones in the development of the neoralchek system 
benefit provision for income taxes 
as a result of the pre tax loss recorded for and the pre tax income for  as well as the estimated tax credits generated in each year  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million in and a provision for income taxes of  in liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations through revenues from operations  private and public placements of equity securities  debt and capital lease financing  cash received under collaborative agreements and interest income 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million compared to million at december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during is largely attributable to the net payment of  made to dade behring as part of the settlement of litigation between dade behring and biosite in march  an additional million payment made under a technology licensing arrangement previously entered into and the purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements totaling approximately million 
these significant uses of cash were offset by the cash generated from operating activities and proceeds from equipment financing and issuances of common stock under our stock plans 
cash generated from operating activities totaled million for compared to  for other significant sources of cash for included the receipt of million from the sale of marketable securities that were not reinvested in other marketable securities  the receipt of million in proceeds from equipment financing and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans 
these proceeds were used to meet our cash requirements during during the year ended december   we generated  in cash from operating activities despite significant investment of cash into our defense of patent matters and new product launch activities such as manufacturing scale up tasks  inventory buildup for new products and sales and marketing activities 
other significant business activities affecting cash included the purchase of license rights to patented technologies totaling million  the expenditure of million for capital equipment and leasehold improvements  the receipt of million in proceeds from equipment financing and payments under equipment financing agreements of million 
our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  are for the support of its commercialization efforts related to new products  expansion of our manufacturing capacity and efficiency for new products  potential licensing of technologies patented by others  potential procurement and enforcement of patents and the continued advancement of research and development efforts 
we executed agreements to license technologies patented by others which call for cash payments and future royalties based on product sales utilizing the licensed technologies 
we may enter into additional licensing agreements that may include up front and annual cash payments and future royalties based on product sales utilizing the licensed technologies 
we utilized and may continue to utilize credit arrangements with financial institutions to finance the purchase of capital equipment 
additionally  we may utilize cash generated from operating activities  if any  to meet our capital requirements 
we are evaluating various alternatives in addressing our future facilities expansion needs 
the alternatives being evaluated include negotiations with various parties for the leasing of additional facility space  which would be adequate for our foreseeable future needs 
leasing of additional facility space would be expected to result in an increase in rent upon occupancy 
we believe that our available cash  cash from operations and funds from existing credit arrangements will be sufficient to satisfy our funding needs for at least the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
additional capital  if needed  may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may include restrictive covenants 
our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the extent to which our new products and products under development are successfully developed  gain market acceptance and become and remain competitive the costs and timing of further expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities  facilities expansion needs the timing and results of clinical studies and regulatory actions regarding our potential products changes in third party reimbursement policies the costs and timing associated with business development activities  including potential licensing of technologies patented by others 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms  when needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily from its variable rate long term debt arrangements and  to a lesser extent  our investments in available for sale marketable securities 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivatives instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
we do have the option to convert our variable rate long term debt arrangements to fixed rate debt arrangements for a nominal transaction fee 
at december   we had variable rate debt totaling approximately million 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially effect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates 
additionally  our purchases of triage meters from lre technology partner gmbh lre are denominated in german deutsche marks dm and sales of some products to some international customers are denominated in the local currency of customers 
we have on occasion purchased forward exchange contracts to manage this exposure to exchange rate changes 
as of december   we had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
total receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies at december  were not material
