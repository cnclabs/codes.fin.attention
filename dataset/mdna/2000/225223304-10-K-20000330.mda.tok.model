the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
on march   the company signed a definitive agreement to acquire the cray research supercomputer business unit and the cray brand name from silicon graphics  inc the acquisition of the cray research unit is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close before the end of april if and when this acquisition is consummated  the company  which would be renamed cray inc  and its future business operations would change significantly 
for further information  see business agreement to acquire cray above 
overview we had an accumulated net loss of approximately million as of december  our funding through the end of has been primarily from the sale of approximately million of securities  research funding from the defense advanced research projects agency darpa of approximately million  and revenue of approximately million 
we have experienced net losses in each year of operations and expect to incur substantial further losses until we make additional sales  and possibly thereafter 
in april  we recognized our first revenue from product sales with our delivery of a two processor mta system to the san diego supercomputer center sdsc 
we upgraded the mta system at sdsc in  first to four processors and then to eight processors and are further upgrading the system to sixteen processors 
see business risk factors failure to complete development of a commercially acceptable mta system would jeopardize our viability and business strategy 
we recognize revenue from sales of mta systems upon acceptance of the system by the customer  although depending on sales contract terms  revenue may be recognized upon shipment or deferred until clarification of funding  we recognize revenue from the maintenance of the mta system ratably over the term of each maintenance agreement and service revenue as services are performed 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
we had revenue in of approximately million  up slightly from million in and  in revenues included million from the sale of the two processor mta system to sdsc  our first revenue from product sales  and revenues included million from the upgrade of the mta system at sdsc to four and then eight processors 
we had contract revenue of  in   in  and  in our contract revenue resulted from our subcontract with sdsc to evaluate multithreaded architecture for certain defense applications 
this contract expired on june  we also anticipate receiving revenue in from the upgrade of the mta system at sdsc to processors  and from other sales to potential customers in  although we currently have no contracts or purchase orders for such sales other than the delivery of the processor unit to sdsc 
see business risk factors 
operating expenses 
cost of revenue from product sales was high in and as a percentage of the revenue due to favorable pricing terms provided to sdsc and the inclusion of costs of system infrastructure to support a full processor mta system 
the cost of contract revenue in was of contract revenue  an increase from in  due to increased services performed by our subcontractors 
in the third quarter of  we began incurring manufacturing costs reflecting our progress to commercial production 
these costs include personnel costs and allocated overhead for our manufacturing group  production expenses not directly related to cost of sales for delivered systems  and inventory adjustments  such as revaluations and cost variations arising from changes in production yields  inventory obsolescence  inventory consumed as part of the manufacturing process and capitalized manufacturing labor and overhead costs 
manufacturing costs totaled million for the third and fourth quarters ended december   including personnel costs and allocated overhead of million  production expenses of  and net inventory adjustments of  with million of inventory obsolescence and consumed inventory partially offset by favorable cost variations and capitalized costs 
manufacturing costs and inventory adjustments were million for the year ended december   including personnel costs and allocated overhead of million  production expenses of million  and net inventory adjustments of million  with million of inventory obsolescence and  of adverse cost variations  partially offset by  of capitalized costs 
during the company incurred inventory obsolescence charges totaling million due to a non cash reserve for gallium arsenide processors  integrated circuits and associated components and parts 
because of the successful initial testing of cmos complementary metal oxide silicon processor and memory controller integrated circuits  the company will not ship these parts 
of this amount  million was deducted from inventory and  were recorded in accounts payable for parts we are contractually required to purchase 
this charge was separately reported on the statements of operations due to its significance 
research and development expenses constitute the largest portion of our operating expenses  and include costs associated with the development of the mta system  including personnel expense  depreciation and lease expense on facilities and equipment  nonrecurring engineering  software and hardware costs  less amounts we receive for research funding 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  and to million in  an increase of in over  and an increase of in over the increase in and would have been greater except for the incurring of manufacturing costs and inventory adjustments beginning in mid  as discussed above 
research and development expenses for included a  charge as compensation expense related to certain performance based stock options  without that charge  research and development expenditures would have been approximately million 
salaries  benefits and allocated overhead for research and development increased from million in excluding the compensation expense for performance based stock options to million in  and increased to million  largely reflecting higher wages and increased operating costs in engineering expenses  consisting of payments to third parties for services and products  were million in  million in and million in engineering expenses remained fairly consistent between and  and increased by  in we spent approximately million in  million in and million in on the conversion from gallium arsenide integrated circuits to cmos integrated circuits  primarily for design services from cadence design services  inc while we expect that research and development expenditures will continue to be a major expense  they are expected to decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses and will generally include expenditures related to modification of the current mta system  research and development related to the next generation mta system and related software development  including personnel expense  depreciation and lease expense on facilities and equipment 
marketing and sales expense has increased from million in to million in and to over million in  an increase of in over and an increase of in over we have continued to increase sales and customer support staff and expenditures in connection with sales and marketing  benchmarks and development of third party applications software 
the increase in expenditures in over was largely due to the impact of a two person  branch sales office in japan and addition of a third us salesperson in the fourth quarter of the increase in these expenses for over was due largely to increased personnel in our applications group and higher operating costs and wages 
we expect that we will continue to increase our marketing and sales activities as we build larger mta systems for sale to industrial and commercial customers 
our general and administrative expenses have increased each year consistent with expansion of our infrastructure 
these expenses were million in  million in and million in  an increase of in over and a further increase in over the increase in expenditures in over was primarily due to additional staff and further increases in legal  investor relations  stock transfer and other costs associated with being a publicly owned company 
the increase in these expenses for over was due largely to non cash expenses of approximately  associated with the provision of warrants and options for consulting services  increased investment relations and shareholder costs  and higher wages and operating costs 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase commensurate with the growth in our operations 
other income expense 
other income expense for increased  or  to  and for decreased by  or  to 
interest income for increased  or  to  and for increased  or  to  reflecting the company s increased cash position due to the sales of equity securities throughout and interest expense for increased  or  to  and for increased  or to  the increase in was largely due to a fully utilized lease line of credit 
the increase in interest expense was due to  of interest paid on bank lines and leases for capital equipment  a non cash interest expense of approximately  associated with the value of the conversion feature of certain convertible promissory notes issued in the first quarter of and a non cash expense of  for the value of detachable warrants issued in conjunction with the convertible promissory notes 
taxes 
we made no provision for federal income taxes in  or as we have continued to incur net operating losses 
as of december   the company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million which expire in years through  if not utilized 
our net operating loss carry forwards and certain other tax attributes including research credits of approximately million at december  would be limited to an annual utilization for losses and credits for periods prior to of approximately  we estimate that the net operating loss carryforwards incurred prior to march are limited to an annual utilization of approximately  this limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
preferred stock 
in the second quarter of  all of our outstanding preferred stock was converted to common stock 
the dividends for were accrued on our series a convertible preferred stock  and were higher than that accrued during the comparable period of because we had more shares of preferred stock then outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in through december   our principal sources of liquidity have been net proceeds from the sale of equity securities totaling million  darpa research funding and subcontracts totaling million and revenue of approximately million 
at december   we had million in unrestricted cash and had no bank line of credit 
during  we spent approximately million of cash on operating activities  up from million in and million in during  our operating activity expenses will depend primarily upon personnel costs  the cost of inventory and third party engineering expenses related to future implementations of the mta system  and the conversion to cmos technology 
our overall wages and benefits increased from million in to million in and to million in we expect that personnel costs will continue to increase in  although not as rapidly as in  and as we have slowed the growth of personnel pending the receipt of additional sales orders 
similarly  we expect inventory costs to decrease in  since we plan only modest inventory additions pending receipt of purchase orders 
in  we incurred third party engineering expenses related to the cmos implementation of the mta system of million 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to approximately million of fixed assets purchased through capital leases and notes payable in net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the increase in over was due primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million during  compared to million during  and to the issuances of debt of million in march all of which was exchanged for common stock in june 
in february  we raised approximately million  net of expenses of approximately million  in a private placement of common stock 
we have also received to date in the first quarter of approximately million from the exercise of warrants covering  shares of common stock 
management believes that our present cash resources and revenue from anticipated sales of mta systems are sufficient to finance our planned operations for the next twelve months 
if we complete the acquisition of the cray research business unit  which will require us to pay million of cash at the closing and the issuance of a nine month promissory note  we believe our present cash resources and our anticipated revenue from sales of cray products and mta systems and maintenance services likewise will be sufficient to finance our planned operations for the next twelve months  including the acquisitions costs 
nevertheless  we likely will raise additional equity and or debt capital in the next twelve months to enhance our financial position for future operations 
in addition  if we were not able to complete development of a commercially acceptable mta system  obtain acceptable hardware components or complete the replacement of cmos integrated circuits  or if anticipated sales of cray products were delayed  as described above  we may need additional capital earlier than planned 
financings may not be available to us when needed or  if available  may not be available on satisfactory terms or may be dilutive to our shareholders 
see business risk factors we may engage in additional financings which may be dilutive to existing shareholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are held in money market funds or commercial paper  with maturities of less than days  which are held to maturity 
accordingly we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
all of our current contract payments are payable in us dollars  and consequently we do not have any foreign currency exchange risks 
we do not hold any derivative instruments and have not engaged in hedging transactions
