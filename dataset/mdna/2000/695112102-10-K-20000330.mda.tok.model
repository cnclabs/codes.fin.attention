item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview 
pacificare sells hmo and hmo related products primarily to members in two groups the secure horizons program for medicare beneficiaries and the commercial plans for members of employer groups and individuals 
our specialty managed care hmos and hmo related products and services supplement our commercial and secure horizons programs 
these include life and health insurance  behavioral health services  dental and vision services  pharmacy benefit management and medicare choice management services 
events significant to our business in include the following in november  we entered a definitive agreement to purchase harris methodist texas health plan  inc and harris methodist health insurance company  inc  a health plan and insurance company in texas with approximately  commercial and  medicare members 
we completed the acquisition effective february  once we had received all necessary approvals from the regulators 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in october  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that allows us to repurchase up to million shares of our outstanding common stock  including any shares purchased from unihealth foundation 
from november   through december   we repurchased million shares under this authorization 
this repurchase program supersedes the stock repurchase program approved in january  under which we purchased million shares 
included in this million shares were million shares repurchased in we also obtained an amendment to our existing credit facility that increased the maximum allowable amount of share repurchases to billion from million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we signed transition agreements with qualmed washington health plans  inc  in october and with qualmed plans for health of colorado  inc in september  each a subsidiary of foundation health systems  inc during the first quarter of we will assume approximately  to  members in colorado and approximately  members in washington 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  we acquired antero health plans in colorado and in february  we acquired  commercial members in texas 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in june  we submitted our proposed secure horizons benefit plan changes to hcfa for approval 
these changes were designed to enable us to maintain our medicare margins in the changes  which were effective january   included increasing our members monthly premiums and copayments or reducing benefits where the government provided insufficient reimbursement 
we expect disenrollments as a result of these premium and benefit adjustments 
in addition  we exited secure horizons operations in counties in ohio  washington  california and oregon effective january  these county exits did not result in a significant loss of our secure horizons members 
see forward looking information under the private securities litigation act of in may  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with unihealth foundation to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock held by unihealth foundation 
at our june  annual meeting  our class a and class b common stockholders approved an amended and restated certificate of incorporation  which combined and reclassified pacificare s class a and class b common stock into a single class of voting common stock 
we paid unihealth foundation million when our stockholders approved the amended and restated certificate of incorporation on june  this payment was recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity 
to date we have not repurchased any of the shares held by unihealth foundation because our stock price has been substantially below the per share price at which unihealth foundation may agree to sell the stock

commercial membership increased approximately three percent at december  compared to membership at december  due to membership increases in california primarily due to improved sales efforts  and in colorado as a result of the acquisition of antero health plans  partially offset by membership losses attributable to our continued focus on renewing commercial contracts with sufficient price increases to improve gross margin  primarily in washington and texas 
government premiums 
government premiums increased five percent or million for the year ended december  compared to premiums in the prior year as follows year ended december  amounts in millions premium rate increases that averaged approximately three percent for the year ended december  net membership increases excluding utah  primarily due to competitors exits in markets where secure horizons will remain membership losses resulting from the disposition of utah increase over prior year government premium rates on a per member basis increased due to higher hcfa premiums received  changes in membership demographics and health status  higher retiree supplemental premiums and the exit of the utah medicaid business

other income increased for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to increased mail service revenues from our pharmacy benefit management company  where we  rather than network retail pharmacies  collect the member copayments 
consolidated medical care ratio 
the consolidated medical care ratio health care services as a percentage of premium revenue declined slightly compared to primarily because current year provider reserves were significantly less than in year ended december medical care ratio consolidated government commercial excluding net provider reserves  the increase in the consolidated medical care ratio compared to was primarily due to higher contracted physician costs  increased pharmacy utilization  pharmacy benefit enhancements and higher prescription drug costs for our secure horizons members 
see compared with consolidated medical care ratio and provider reserves for further discussion of provider reserves 
government medical care ratio 
the government medical care ratio for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year due to higher contracted physician costs  increased pharmacy utilization  pharmacy benefit enhancements and higher prescription drug costs  partially offset by higher premiums  and reduced hospital expenses  primarily because current year provider reserves were significantly less than in commercial medical care ratio 
the commercial medical care ratio includes the specialty hmos and indemnity insurance results 
the commercial medical care ratio for the year ended december  decreased compared to the prior year due to the following premium rate increases  the sale of our utah hmo and workers compensation subsidiaries  partially offset by higher contracted physician costs 
marketing  general and administrative expenses

year ended december marketing  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue impairment  disposition  restructuring and other credits charges 
we recognized impairment  disposition  restructuring and other pretax credits in totaling million after tax charges of million or diluted loss per share 
the after tax and per share amounts were losses because the goodwill impairment was not deductible for income tax purposes 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating income 
factors contributing to the increase in operating income are discussed above 
year ended december operating income as a percentage of operating revenue net investment income 
net investment income decreased approximately percent for the year ended december  compared to the prior year due to the following fewer realized gains on sales of marketable securities in the current year  and the shift of more portfolio holdings to tax exempt investments that have lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased approximately percent for the year ended december  compared to the prior year due to the reduction in outstanding borrowings until december  when we borrowed million to fund our share repurchase program  and lower overall average interest rates paid on our credit facility 
provision for income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was percent in  compared with percent in the rate declined significantly because nondeductible goodwill amortization was a smaller percentage of pretax income  we benefited from certain tax strategies  in particular the legal reorganization of pacificare and its subsidiaries  which resulted in lower state income taxes  the effective tax rate included an increase related to nondeductible losses recognized for the dispositions of the utah hmo and workers compensation subsidiaries  and investment strategies resulted in increased tax exempt earnings 
diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december   net income was million or diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december   net income was million or diluted earnings per share 
the change was due to the following year ended december diluted earnings per share december  impairment  disposition  restructuring  opm and other charges diluted earnings per share before impairment  disposition  restructuring  opm and other charges december  change attributable to operations commercial medical care ratio performance government medical care ratio performance marketing  general and administrative expenses other income performance amortization of goodwill and intangible assets total change attributable to operations net investment income and interest expense income tax rate decrease accretive impact of share repurchases due to million shares repurchased in diluted earnings per share before impairment  disposition  restructuring and other credits charges december  impairment  disposition  restructuring  and other credits charges diluted earnings per share december  compared with membership

the government program represents the medicare and medicaid lines of business 
government membership decreased approximately three percent at december  compared to the membership at the end of the prior year primarily as a result of the sale of our utah hmo and our exit from certain rural counties 
commercial membership decreased approximately eight percent at december  compared to the membership at the end of the prior year due to the sale of our utah hmo  and our continued focus on renewing commercial contracts with sufficient price increases to improve gross margin  primarily in california 
government premiums 
government premiums increased seven percent or million for the year ended december  compared to premiums in the prior year as follows year ended december  amounts in millions the inclusion of six additional weeks of results in from the fhp acquisition premium rate increases that averaged approximately four percent for the year ended december  net membership losses caused by our exit of certain rural geographic areas and the medicaid line of business  primarily in california  utah and texas increase over prior year commercial premiums

other income increased in from the prior year due primarily to higher revenues from our pharmacy benefit management company and shusa 
consolidated medical care ratio and provider reserves 
the consolidated medical care ratio declined percent compared to year ended december medical care ratio consolidated government commercial the improved commercial product performance was partially offset by increased provider reserves 
excluding these reserves  the consolidated medical care ratio was percent 
provider reserves were immaterial in and totaled million in as follows quarter government commercial total amounts in millions first second third fourth total the majority of the provider reserves related to specific provider bankruptcies 
however  the estimate also included reserves for potentially insolvent providers  where conditions indicated claims were not being paid or had slowed considerably 
provider charges include the write off of uncollectable receivables from providers and the estimated cost of unpaid health care claims covered by our capitation payments 
depending on state law  we may be held liable for unpaid health care claims that were the responsibility of the capitated provider 
reserves for the fpa medical management  inc bankruptcy totaled million  with million attributable to our nevada hmo 
reserves for other providers totaled million 
approximately million of the reserves recognized in the third and fourth quarters related to caremark rx  inc formerly medpartners  inc  who ceased paying claims in nevada and arizona 
the membership was transitioned to other providers between december and january the remaining million was the estimated liability for smaller bankrupt providers and potentially insolvent providers  primarily in california 
government medical care ratio 
the government medical care ratio for the year ended december  increased percent compared to the prior year because we recognized million of provider reserves 
government provider reserves for fpa were million  with the majority of these charges recognized in the second and third quarters 
other provider reserves of million were recorded primarily in the fourth quarter 
higher costs incurred for fpa membership shifting into new provider relationships were offset by the disposition of utah in september excluding government provider reserves  the government medical care ratio was percent 
commercial medical care ratio 
the commercial medical care ratio includes the specialty hmos and indemnity insurance results 
the commercial medical care ratio for the year ended december  decreased due to the following improved provider contracts  premium rate increases  improved performance from the specialty hmos  sale of our utah hmo and workers compensation subsidiaries  offset by provider reserves of million 
commercial provider reserves for fpa totaled million  primarily recognized in the second and third quarters 
other provider reserves of million were recognized in the fourth quarter and related to arizona  california  nevada  texas and washington 
excluding commercial provider reserves  the commercial medical care ratio was percent 
marketing  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december  compared to  marketing  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue decreased because we realized the benefits of restructuring and a full year of synergies as a result of the fhp acquisition 
year ended december marketing  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue impairment  disposition  restructuring  opm and other charges 
we recognized million of net pretax charges in  primarily for dispositions of unprofitable operations 
favorable opm settlements in the fourth quarter partially offset increased reserves recognized in the third quarter 
in  we recognized million of pretax charges primarily related to our impairment of our utah and washington hmos and our workers compensation subsidiary 
restructuring reserves recognized in were paid in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating income 
factors contributing to the increase in operating income are discussed above 
year ended december operating income as a percentage of operating revenue net investment income 
net investment income increased approximately percent in compared to the prior year  due primarily to gains on sales of marketable securities experienced throughout and more efficient investment through account consolidation 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased approximately six percent in compared to the prior year  due to continued repayment of our credit facility and declining interest rates 
the decrease was partially offset by interest on the fhp acquisition borrowings that were outstanding for six weeks longer in provision for income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was percent in  compared with percent in the rate declined significantly for two reasons the effective rate was disproportionately high because most of the pretax charges recorded in the fourth quarter of were not deductible for tax purposes 
the effective income tax rate without the effect of the pretax charges was approximately percent 
we had a smaller percentage of nondeductible goodwill amortization as part of our expenses 
diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december   net income was million or diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december   the net loss was million or diluted loss per share 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows 
pacificare s consolidated cash  equivalents and marketable securities increased to billion at december  from billion at december  the combined increase in cash  equivalents and marketable securities occurred primarily due to the large draws on our line of credit to repurchase shares in the open market 
in addition  the medicare payment received from hcfa in december for january was higher than the amount received in december for january investing activities 
for the year ended december   we used million of cash for investing activities  compared to million used in we purchased more marketable securities and property  plant and equipment in  resulting in the majority of the net increase over the prior year 
property  plant and equipment purchases were primarily related to internally developed software and computer equipment 
financing activities 
for the year ended december   we used million of cash for financing activities compared to million used for the same period of the prior year 
the decrease was primarily related to fewer credit facility payments 
the changes were as follows we repurchased million shares of our common stock in for million compared to million shares of our common stock in for million under our stock repurchase programs  we borrowed under the credit facility to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock 
borrowings were million in and million in  we paid million in principal on our credit facility during in comparison to million in principal in principal payments declined as we used available cash to fund our stock repurchases  in consideration for unihealth foundation s vote for the reclassification of our stock and in consideration for the agreements and covenants contained in the stock purchase agreement between pacificare and unihealth foundation  we paid unihealth foundation million on june   when our stockholders approved the amended and restated certificate of incorporation 
we incurred million of expenses related to the reclassification of our common stock and the registration of the shares held by unihealth foundation 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we received cash for the issuance of common stock totaling million for the year ended december  compared to million for year ended december   and we paid million in preferred stock dividends in no preferred dividends were paid in because all of the outstanding preferred stock was converted or redeemed in other balance sheet change explanations receivables  net 
receivables  net increased million from december  primarily due to increases in provider receivables as a result of our higher proportion of shared risk hospital contracts 
in shared risk contracts  pacificare shares the risk of certain health care costs not covered by capitation arrangements and we provide additional incentives to the physicians or groups for appropriate utilization of hospital inpatient  outpatient surgery and emergency room services 
in some cases  the utilization of the hospital health care costs is above the budgeted percentage as specified in the contract 
as a result  the hospital or medical group shares the liability for these costs with pacificare 
goodwill and intangible assets  net 
goodwill and intangible assets decreased million from as follows million decrease attributable to goodwill and intangible amortization expense  million decrease attributable to the impairment of the ohio hmo s goodwill  partially offset by million increase attributable to membership acquisitions in texas and colorado 
medical claims and benefits payable 
medical claims and benefits payable increased million from december  as follows million increase in claims incurred but not yet reported for increased membership and utilization under shared risk hospital arrangements 
under capitation arrangements  providers are prepaid based on a fixed fee per member per month  regardless of the services provided to each member 
under shared risk arrangements  claims are payable  once incurred 
this results in a payable for claims incurred  but not yet paid as well as an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported to pacificare  million increase primarily due to increased amounts withheld from capitation for claims we administered on behalf of non delegated providers  million increase in pharmacy claims attributable to a one day lag in payment to our two largest pharmacy chains 
this occurs when the payment date falls on a weekend  partially offset by million net decrease in provider insolvency reserves  consisting of million in payments primarily to nevada providers  other net changes in estimates totaling million  partially offset by million in additional provisions  and million net decrease in other provider liabilities 
accounts payable 
accounts payable increased million primarily due to increased prescription drug inventory purchases from manufacturers that are not payable until january  higher legal and professional costs and higher broker commission accruals due to increased membership 
accrued liabilities 
accrued liabilities decreased million from december  primarily due to income taxes payable 
the decrease was attributable to higher estimated tax payments  partially offset by the income tax provision on income

factors contributing to the increase in operating income are discussed above

these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology including  may  will  could  should  intend  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  potentially  continue  or opportunity or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
the statements about our plans  strategies  intentions  expectations and prospects contained throughout the document are forward looking and are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially from those predicted as of the date of this report in the forward looking statements 
in addition  past financial performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical performance to anticipate results or future period trends 
in evaluating these statements  you should specifically consider factors  including the risks described below and in other parts of this annual report 
the expectations discussed below include qualmed membership assumed during the first quarter of and the february  acquisition of harris 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
membership 
we expect the rate of government membership growth to be up to three percent for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the harris acquisition 
we expect approximately  harris members will remain enrolled by the end of in addition  we will continue to focus our marketing efforts on group retiree members and growing membership as our competitors exit markets where secure horizons will remain 
these increases will be partially offset by membership decreases as a result of reducing benefits  increasing copayments and instituting or increasing member paid supplemental premiums in certain markets 
we also experienced a slight membership decrease due to discontinued medicare risk contracts in counties in ohio  washington  california and oregon effective january  we expect the rate of commercial membership growth to range from percent to percent for the year ended december  the majority of the growth will be a result of acquisitions 
we expect to increase membership by approximately  by the end of as a result of the harris acquisition 
we also expect to assume approximately  to  members in colorado and approximately  members in washington by the end of  as a result of the agreements signed with qualmed 
in addition  we expect growth in california  where we plan to focus our marketing efforts on membership retention and renewal of national and major employer accounts 
premiums 
hcfa premium rate increases combined with supplemental member premiums are expected to be approximately three percent to five percent in we instituted or increased member paid supplemental premiums for approximately percent of our secure horizons members for the first time in certain markets  and increased premiums in other markets  to offset lower annual hcfa premium rate increases 
commercial hmo premium rate increases are expected to range from seven percent to nine percent in we expect our commercial premium revenue to increase percent to percent as a result of these rate increases combined with our expected commercial membership growth 
in addition  in the second half of the year we plan to implement higher premium rate increases in california to cover the cost of new mental health coverage mandated under state and federal laws 
membership and premium risk factors 
an unforeseen loss of profitable membership or a change in premium expectations could negatively affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
factors that could contribute to the loss of membership or lower premiums include the inability of our marketing and sales plans to attract new customers or retain existing customers  the effect of premium increases  benefit changes and member paid supplemental premiums and copayments  our exit from certain markets  reductions in work force by existing customers  negative publicity and news coverage or threats of litigation  our failure to successfully complete and or integrate contemplated acquisitions  and the loss of our key employees in sales and marketing 
other income 
in  we expect other income to increase  primarily related to increased pharmacy mail service revenues 
health care costs 
our profitability depends  in part  on our ability to control health care costs while providing quality care 
our primary focus is securing cost effective physician  hospital and other health care provider contracts to maintain our qualified network of providers in each geographic area we serve 
through december   consolidated medical and hospital costs were trending between one and five percent higher 
other costs  the majority of which is prescription drugs  were trending between percent and percent higher 
these health care cost trends are expected to be slightly higher in since the end of  our hospital providers have increasingly not wanted to renew capitated hospital contracts and have requested fee for service and shared risk arrangements 
as a result of this trend  the percentage of consolidated members under capitated arrangements for hospital contracts has decreased from percent at the end of to approximately percent to percent at the end of we expect the percentage of capitated hospital contracts to continue to decrease in to between percent and percent  particularly in markets where providers face less competition 
we expect to increase the capitation rates we pay some of our medical and hospital providers to improve the network stability of our capitated providers 
to offset these increases  we have reduced benefits  increased copayments and instituted or increased member paid supplemental premiums in certain markets for our secure horizons members 
we have also begun to implement initiatives intended to improve performance of our provider contracts  including our medical management redesign initiative 
see health care costs and provider relationships medical management redesign 
members in contracts that are capitated for professional risk were approximately percent at december  and are not expected to change in we work closely with our provider partners to ensure the strength and quality of our network 
under fee for service contracts  we have no insolvency risk  however  we do have increased utilization risk 
under our capitated arrangements  we face the risk of a provider becoming insolvent 
to minimize our insolvency risk  we have developed contingency plans that include shifting members to other providers and reviewing operational and financial plans to increase financial stability 
we believe our december  provider insolvency reserves  intended to pay for december and prior health care services that may not be paid by insolvent or unstable providers  are adequate 
pharmacy 
our prescription drug costs have been rising for the past few years 
the increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs  direct consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry creating consumer demand for particular brand drugs  patients seeking medications to address lifestyle changes and higher prescribed doses of medications and enhanced pharmacy benefits for members such as reduced copayments and higher benefit maximums 
our efforts to mitigate these trends and ensure appropriate utilization include formulary management  provider education  successful pharmaceutical contracting and increased utilization of our in house mail service pharmacy operated by prescription solutions 
formularies are lists of physician recommended drugs in different therapeutic classes that have been reviewed for safety  efficacy and value 
these lists help ensure that members get the right prescription at the right time in the right dose  avoiding potential adverse effects 
formularies also ensure that the costs are effectively managed  if two medications have the same effect  the less expensive option often a generic alternative is recommended 
medically necessary drugs not included in the formulary can be obtained through our authorization process 
we continue to conduct member and physician education programs to provide information on the appropriate use of generic drugs  over the counter drugs and antibiotics 
many of our medical groups share the financial risk for prescription drugs to find the most effective and cost efficient treatments for our members 
prescription drug benefit changes for secure horizons members have been implemented in almost all our geographic areas for as a way of controlling this health care cost component 
consolidated medical care ratio 
we manage premium increases to offset health care cost increases to maintain long term stability in our medical care ratio 
our same store business is expected to have a consolidated medical care ratio comparable to our acquisition of harris is expected to slightly increase the consolidated medical care ratio 
government medical care ratio 
we expect the government medical care ratio to increase compared to the december  medical care ratio 
we expect increases in capitation rates and higher claims under shared risk arrangements to cause an increase in the medical care ratio 
to partially offset these rising health care costs  we plan to charge member paid supplemental premiums  reduce benefits and increase our hospital utilization management 
commercial medical care ratio 
we expect the commercial medical care ratio to slightly increase due to the number of fee for service provider contracts and the more extensive drug formulary  both obtained as a result of the harris acquisition 
in addition  we also expect increases in costs resulting from higher pharmacy costs and increased utilization under our shared risk contracts 
these increases will be partially offset by premium rate increases and cost savings from hospital utilization management 
medical care ratio risk factors 
an increase in our consolidated medical care ratio could have an adverse effect on our profitability 
uncertainties that could have a negative impact on our medical care ratio include the mix of our capitated  shared risk and fee for service provider contracts  medical and prescription drug costs that rise faster than premium increases  increases in utilization and costs of medical and hospital services  our inability to successfully implement our new medical management initiatives including hospital utilization management initiatives  the effect of federal and or state legislation on our ability to secure cost effective contracts with providers  the effect of actions by competitors  termination of provider contracts  provider instability or renegotiations of such contracts at less favorable rates or terms of payment  and legislation that gives physicians collective bargaining power 
we have and may continue to incur additional health care costs 
the effect of these risks and the need for additional provider reserves could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows of a future period 
we believe  however  that such reserves would not materially affect our consolidated financial position 
marketing  general and administrative expenses 
we expect marketing  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue to be comparable or slightly increase compared to we expect increases as we invest in our medical management initiative by hiring additional personnel and as we make planned investments in technology 
we anticipate spending million to million to integrate the harris acquisition 
in addition  we expect to incur employee severance costs in the first quarter 
these increases will be partially offset by our plan to gain efficiencies in a number of functional areas including the centralization and consolidation of our sales and marketing and human resources departments 
marketing  general and administrative risk factors 
the following factors could have an adverse impact on marketing  general and administrative expenses our compliance with the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  our need for additional advertising  marketing  administrative or management information systems expenditures  the success of our marketing and sales plans to attract new customers  our need for increased claims administration for capitated providers  our need for additional unanticipated investments in medical management resources and technology  integration costs for harris and other acquisitions that exceed our expectations  ineffectiveness of the use of the internet to originate small group and individual policies  and our inability to achieve the anticipated efficiencies and resulting cost savings 
restructuring 
in january  we announced a restructuring that will allow us to develop plans to strengthen our operations through planned productivity enhancements and technology improvements to further our competitive advantages and growth opportunities 
as a result of these changes  we will record a restructuring charge of approximately million to million in the first quarter of the restructuring charge includes severance and related employee benefits 
in january  we reduced our workforce by employees 
during the twelve months ending december   an additional employees are in transition  which will result in further reductions in workforce 
in addition  other positions will be eliminated through attrition and cancellation of certain open positions 
health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
hipaa includes administrative simplification provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions  establishing uniform health care provider  payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data 
proposed rules under hipaa administrative simplification are expected to be released as final rules during for full implementation within two years from the date of each release 
the administrative simplification portion of hipaa as currently proposed would require health plans  health care providers  health care clearing houses and additional third parties such as business partners to communicate electronically using standardized formats 
we are proceeding as if the proposed rules will be adopted as currently proposed 
we will be undertaking an assessment of our current systems to determine where they diverge from the requirements of administrative simplification 
we expect to begin this analysis by the end of the first quarter and believe we will be able to determine the cost of implementation of the administrative simplification requirements of hipaa by the beginning of the third quarter 
currently  we are unable to assess the cost of implementation of the administrative simplification requirements of hipaa or predict the results of the system analysis 
future dispositions and impairments 
we continue to evaluate whether our subsidiaries or products fit within our health plans division s strategy and may decide to dispose of some of our businesses or products 
we review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered 
we consider assets to be impaired and write them down to fair value if we determine that the realizable value of long lived assets such as property and equipment  real estate and goodwill are less than the value carried on the consolidated financial statements 
we cannot be certain that the dispositions and impairments will not result in additional pretax charges 
we believe that any disposition or impairment losses would not materially affect our consolidated financial position 
however  the disposition or impairment losses could have a material effect on the results of operations or cash flows of a future period 
operating income 
including first quarter restructuring charges  we expect the rate of operating income growth to be up to seven percent for the year ended december  this growth expectation is based upon our membership growth and premium growth assumptions and our medical care ratio and marketing  general and administrative assumptions and is subject to the risks discussed for each of these assumptions 
net investment income 
we expect net investment income for the year ended december  to increase compared to due to significant cash balances acquired in the harris acquisition and expected increases in short term interest rates 
interest expense 
in  we expect interest expense will significantly increase compared to primarily due to increased borrowings on our credit facility to fund our share repurchase program 
in addition  the reduction in our credit rating by the credit rating agencies  combined with a higher interest fee structure in the credit facility amendment and rising market interest rates  will result in higher interest rates in effective tax rate 
we expect our effective tax rate for the year ended december  to be approximately percent to percent compared to percent for during  we recognized million of ohio hmo goodwill impairment charges  which will lower nondeductible goodwill amortization and reduce the tax rate for the year ended december  we cannot be certain that pretax income will increase as projected or that future business decisions will not impact the estimated effective tax rate 
weighted average number of shares 
we expect the weighted average number of shares used to compute diluted earnings per share to be approximately million to million shares for the year ended december  this range is based on the assumption that we will repurchase approximately million shares during the following factors could affect the weighted average number of shares calculation for fluctuations in our stock price that influence the number of shares repurchased and the options exercised  the magnitude of stock options granted during the year  any unanticipated stock for stock acquisitions  equity  convertible preferred or debt issuances  and management decisions to use cash from operations or credit facility borrowings on business initiatives other than share repurchases 
diluted earnings per share 
we expect to achieve our long term diluted earnings per share growth goal of approximately percent in year pacificare implemented a year compliance program to address all major computing information systems  including core application systems  networks  desktop systems  infrastructure and critical information supply chains 
we also addressed risks relating to the year readiness of third parties with whom we maintain ongoing relationships 
we incurred approximately million to make our core computing systems year compliant  including approximately million that we incurred prior to and approximately million that we incurred in the expenses related primarily to remedying the claims based fhp core systems that we acquired with the february fhp acquisition 
we have not experienced any material failures or disruptions of our operations or internal systems due to year problems 
we also have not experienced any material problems relating to year problems of third party vendors  providers or other parties with whom we have relationships 
in january  we received our scheduled payment from hcfa without delay 
the risk of delayed payment was one of the most significant potential risks we identified and addressed through our contingency plans 
we continue to have contingency plans in place and will continue to monitor year matters until we are satisfied that we no longer face any material risks 
office of personnel management contingencies 
we intend to negotiate with opm on any existing or future unresolved matters to attain a mutually satisfactory result 
we cannot be certain that any ongoing and future negotiations will be concluded satisfactorily  that additional audits will not be referred to the department of justice  or that additional  possibly material  liability will not be incurred 
we believe that any ultimate liability in excess of amounts accrued would not materially affect our consolidated financial position 
however  such liability could have a material effect on results of operations or cash flows of a future period if resolved unfavorably 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
adjusted community rate filings 
we intend to cooperate with hcfa or any person or organization designated by hcfa in all acr audits 
we cannot be certain that any ongoing and future audits will be concluded satisfactorily 
we may incur additional  possibly material  liability as a result of these audits 
we believe that any ultimate liability would not materially affect our consolidated financial position 
however  the incurrence of such liability could have a material effect on results of operations or cash flows of a future period 
liquidity and capital resources 
the terms of our credit facility permit us to repurchase up to billion of our outstanding common stock 
we plan to fund repurchases through a combination of cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility 
our ability to repay amounts owed under the credit facility depends on dividends from our subsidiaries 
nearly all of the subsidiaries are subject to hmo regulations or insurance regulations and may be subject to substantial supervision by one or more hmo or insurance regulators 
subsidiaries subject to regulation must meet or exceed various capital standards imposed by hmo or insurance regulations  which may from time to time impact the amount of funds the subsidiaries can pay to us 
our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us and creditors of our subsidiaries have superior claim to our subsidiaries assets 
additionally  from time to time  we advance funds in the form of a loan or capital contribution to our subsidiaries to assist them in satisfying federal or state financial requirements 
if a federal or state regulator has concerns about the financial position of a subsidiary  a regulator may impose additional financial requirements on the subsidiary  which may require additional funding from us 
we believe that cash flows from operations  existing cash equivalents  marketable securities and other financing sources will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the credit facility  stock repurchases and our business operations during the next twelve months 
risk based capital requirements 
the national association of insurance commissioners has proposed that states adopt risk based capital standards that  if implemented  would require new minimum capitalization limits for health care coverage provided by hmos and other risk bearing health care entities 
to date  colorado and washington are the only states where we have hmo operations that have adopted these standards 
we do not expect this legislation to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position in the near future if other states where we operate hmos adopt these standards 
we believe that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund any additional risk based capital requirements 
further borrowings under the credit facility could be used for risk based capital requirements  if necessary 
legislation and regulation 
recent changes in state and federal legislation have increased and will continue to increase the costs of regulatory compliance  and proposed changes in the law may negatively impact our financial and operating results 
these changes may increase our medical care ratios  decrease our membership or otherwise adversely affect our revenues and our profitability 
regulation and enforcement is increasing both at the state and federal level 
increased regulations  mandated benefits and more oversight  audits and investigations may increase our administrative  litigation and health care costs 
the following recent or proposed legislation  regulation or initiatives could materially affect our financial position new and proposed legislation that would hold hmos liable for medical malpractice including proposed federal legislation that would remove the federal preemption set forth in erisa that precludes most individuals from suing their employer based health plan for causes of action based upon state law 
to date  both california and texas have adopted regulations that may increase the likelihood of lawsuits against hmos for malpractice liability  existing and proposed legislation that would limit our ability to manage care and utilization such as any willing provider and direct access laws  new state and proposed federal laws mandating benefits including those that mandate equal coverage for mental health benefits mental health parity  proposed federal regulations that place new restrictions and administrative requirements on the use of  the electronic retention of  the transmission of and the disclosure of personally identifiable health information  new and proposed legislation that permit and would permit independent physicians to collectively bargain with health plans on a number of issues including financial compensation  legislation and regulation could also include adverse actions of governmental payors  including reduced medicare premiums  discontinuance of  or limitation on  governmentally funded programs  recovery by governmental payors of previously paid amounts  the inability to increase premiums or prospective or retroactive reductions to premium rates for federal employees  and adverse regulatory actions  new and increased initiatives at the doj  the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services  the office of inspector general of the united states office of personnel management and the various enforcement divisions of the state regulatory agencies governing health care programs 
these initiatives pursue both civil and criminal investigations against health care providers  payors  and pharmaceutical companies for misconduct relating to potential health care fraud and abuse  false claims  erisa violations  violations of the medicare program  overbilling of government programs  incorrect reporting of data  improper denial or mismanagement of care  state legislation that may increase the financial capital requirements of providers who contract with hmos to accept financial risk for health services  or legislation that would otherwise limit our ability to capitate providers or delegate financial risk  utilization review  quality assurance or other medical decisions to our contracting providers  and increases in minimum capital  reserves  and other financial liability requirements 
industry risk 
consumers are currently attacking practices of the hmo industry through a number of separate class action lawsuits against pacificare and against other national hmos 
these lawsuits  including the ones filed to date against pacificare  may take years to resolve and  depending upon the outcomes of these cases  may cause or force changes in practices of the hmo industry 
these cases also may cause additional regulation of the industry through new federal or state laws 
these changes ultimately could adversely affect the hmo industry and could have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows of a future period and prospects of pacificare 
stock market risk factors 
the market prices of the securities of pacificare and certain of the publicly held companies in the industry in which we operate have shown volatility and sensitivity in response to many factors  including variations in our financial results  general market conditions  the investor s perception of our business model and strategy  including the use of capitation and the mix of commercial and medicare membership  changes in earnings estimates by industry research analysts  public communications regarding managed care  legislative or regulatory actions  health care cost trends  pricing trends  competition  earnings or membership reports of particular industry participants  the outcome of class action lawsuits  and acquisition activity 
we cannot assure the level or stability of our share price at any time  or the impact of the foregoing or any other factors may have on our share price 
the market price of our common stock may decline significantly if our earnings results for any quarter are below the expectations of industry research analysts 
other 
results may differ materially from those projected  forecasted  estimated and budgeted by us due to adverse results in ongoing audits or in other reviews conducted by federal or state agencies or health care purchasing cooperatives  adverse results in significant litigation matters  and changes in interest rates causing changes in interest expense and net investment income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal objective of our asset liability management activities is to maximize net investment income  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk and facilitating our funding needs 
our net investment income and interest expense are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  we manage the structure of the maturity of debt and investments and also use derivatives 
we use derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  with maturities that correlate to balance sheet financial instruments 
this results in a modification of existing interest rates to levels deemed appropriate based on our current economic outlook 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  for investment securities and debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed our marketable securities and marketable securities restricted  comprised primarily of us government  state  municipal  and corporate debt securities  are similar enough to aggregate into fixed rate and variable rate securities for presentation purposes 
our average interest rate for the year is lower than future years because of the inclusion of zero coupon securities in for terms relating to our long term debt  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements
