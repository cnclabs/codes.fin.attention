item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
overview blue rhino was founded in march and has become a leading national provider of branded products and services to retailers including gas grill cylinder exchange  with blue rhino cylinder displays at more than  retail locations in states and puerto rico 
cylinder exchange provides consumers with a convenient means to exchange empty grill cylinders for clean  safe  precision filled cylinders 
we offer our cylinder exchange at many major home improvement centers  mass merchants  hardware  grocery and convenience stores  including home depot  lowe s  wal mart  sears  kmart  kroger  food lion  winn dixie  superamerica  circle k and exxonmobil 
during fiscal  our net revenues increased approximately to approximately million from the prior fiscal year due primarily to sales growth at existing locations  the addition of over  new retail locations and acquisitions 
the number of retail locations we report in any period is net of any retail locations at which we have discontinued our cylinder exchange service  whether due to closings  relocations  performance  competitive  regulatory or other factors 
we partner with retailers and independent distributors to provide consumers with a nationally branded alternative to traditional grill cylinder refill 
we dedicate our efforts and capital to brand development  value added marketing  customer service  cylinders  displays  account growth  distributor network development and management information systems 
our independent distributors invest in the vehicles and refilling and refurbishing equipment necessary to operate cylinder exchange businesses 
we believe that our distributor network affords us the opportunity to service approximately of the cylinder exchange markets in the united states 
to facilitate improved service by our distributors in the eastern us  we opened a jointly owned automated propane bottling and cylinder refurbishing plant in north carolina in may we currently offer three types of grill cylinder transactions i like for like cylinder exchanges  ii cylinder exchanges with valve upgrades offering additional safety features  and iii filled cylinder sales 
for fiscal  cylinder exchanges  cylinder upgrades and cylinder sales were approximately  and  respectively  of our total grill cylinder transactions 
cylinder transactions accounted for of our net revenues in fiscal in addition to grill cylinder transactions  our revenues include cylinder related product sales  principally from patio heaters  lease income on cylinders and cylinder displays leased to our distributors  and non cylinder related product sales by uniflame  our newly acquired subsidiary 
lease income accounted for of our net revenues in fiscal our revenues are influenced by a number of factors  including seasonality  consumer awareness  weather conditions  new grill sales  alternative uses for grill cylinders  promotional activities and advertising 
we strategically expanded our business this past year to diversify our revenue stream  balance our seasonality and establish more products that use our base grill cylinder exchange service 
our acquisitions of uniflame  inc uniflame  international propane products  llc ipp and bison valve  llc bison valve have allowed us to expand our offerings to include an array of products including barbecue grills  patio heaters  a proprietary overfill prevention device opd  fireplace accessories and garden products that are sold primarily through home centers  mass merchants and hearth stores throughout the united states 
in these acquisitions  we also acquired proprietary designs  patents and human capital to complement our expertise in marketing  sales  and coordination with manufacturers and distributors 
our products division is separately managed by uniflame s management team  which has extensive experience in the design and import of consumer products sold through mass retailers 
our cost of sales for cylinder exchange is comprised of a contractually determined fixed charge that we pay to our distributors based upon the type of cylinder transaction 
our cost of sales for products is comprised of the wholesale cost of products sold 
we incurred significantly higher costs for cylinder exchange in fiscal than anticipated  due to wholesale propane prices reaching a year high during our peak sales period and our fixed price agreements with major retail customers 
during our fourth quarter of fiscal  we made voluntary payments of approximately million to our distributors to help offset the impact on our distributors of the significantly higher propane prices  to protect our large retail customers from supply disruptions and to ensure continued strong distributor and customer relationships 
we have begun to increase prices to retailers and expect the process of raising prices to be completed by january we are exploring alternative hedging arrangements to reduce the risk associated with propane prices and are positioning ourselves to more quickly pass on to retailers price increases resulting from any future abnormalities in wholesale propane pricing 
while we believe that we have created the infrastructure necessary to support a nationwide branded products and service company  development of this infrastructure has resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of july  this has resulted in net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes that are available to offset future taxable income  if any  in varying amounts from through however  the utilization of the net operating losses will be subject to certain limitations as prescribed by section of the internal revenue code 
based on our history of operating losses  we have recorded a valuation allowance to the full extent of our net deferred tax assets 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationship of certain items from our statements of operations to net revenues 
due to the change in our business model and our rapid sales growth  any trends reflected by the following table may not be indicative of future results 
net revenues operating costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization non recurring items total operating costs and expenses income loss from operations other expense income interest expense other  net income loss before other non operating expenses other non operating expenses loss on investees follow on offering income loss before taxes and extraordinary loss income taxes income loss before extraordinary loss extraordinary loss net income loss comparison of years ended july  and net revenues 
net revenues increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal net revenues for fiscal consisted of approximately million from cylinder transactions  million from product sales and million from lease and other income 
product sales consist of patio heaters  fireplace accessories  barbecue grills and garden products 
lease and other income relates primarily to cylinders and cylinder displays leased to our distributors 
the increase in net revenues was due primarily to an approximately increase in same store cylinder transaction sales  growth in cylinder exchange locations  product sales related to the acquisition of uniflame in april and growth in the sales of patio heaters to million in fiscal from  in fiscal we expect that product sales will represent an increasing portion of our net revenues in fiscal when our results include a full year of sales of uniflame s product line 
lease and other income increased due primarily to the growth in the number of cylinder displays placed in service and to the leasing of cylinders to distributors under operating leases  which commenced in fiscal the number of cylinder transactions increased to approximately million units during fiscal from approximately million units during fiscal we expect the number of cylinder transactions in fiscal to increase by over million units based on our estimated double digit growth in same store transactions and the estimated addition of  new locations 
gross margin 
our overall gross margin decreased to approximately for fiscal from approximately for fiscal we generally target gross margins on cylinder transactions and product sales in the range of to and to  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased payments to distributors to help offset the increase in wholesale propane prices and an increase in the mix of lower margin product sales  which were partially offset by an increase in lease income 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increased overhead costs resulting from the acquisition of uniflame  which contributed approximately million of the increase  as well as increased advertising and promotional expenses and additional compensation and related costs from the growth of our sales  administrative and dealer personnel 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal to increase as a result of the inclusion of uniflame for the full year 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal depreciation expense increased by million to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal primarily due to the increase in the number of cylinder displays and the commencement of depreciation on cylinders held under operating lease agreements 
the increase in cylinders and cylinder displays was due to growth in our installed base of retail locations 
our purchase of computer technology also impacted depreciation expense to a lesser extent 
amortization expense increased by  to approximately million in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal  principally due to the increased amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions 
interest expense

other  net 
other  net decreased to an expense of approximately  for fiscal from income of approximately  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest income resulting from lower excess cash and notes receivable balances 
loss on investees 
loss on investees increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal this item reflects distinct investees for each year 
fiscal reflects our share of losses related to our investment in the r technical center north carolina  llc r tech  our jointly owned automated propane bottling and cylinder refurbishing plant  which opened in may we expect this venture to continue to experience losses  which we believe are typical in start up manufacturing operations  until volumes increase  which we believe will occur next summer 
we cannot  however  predict with certainty when this will occur  if ever 
the loss incurred in fiscal is related to the application of the equity method of accounting to our convertible loan to bison valve 
we recorded these losses as bison valve used the proceeds of our loan to fund losses incurred primarily in researching  developing  marketing and producing an opd and other propane related products 
as of october   we had recognized charges for the entire principal balance of our convertible loan 
in september  we purchased from bison valve the intellectual property  inventory and certain other assets related to its underwriters laboratories approved opd

net revenues increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal net revenues of million for fiscal consisted of approximately million from cylinder transactions  million from lease income and approximately  from patio heater sales 
lease income related primarily to cylinders and cylinder displays leased to our distributors 
the increase in net revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of retail locations placed in service and increased sales volume at existing locations 
the increase in lease income was due primarily to the growth in the number of cylinder displays placed in service and to the leasing of cylinders to distributors under operating leases which commenced in fiscal the number of cylinders transacted increased to approximately million units during fiscal from approximately million units during fiscal gross margin 
gross margin increased to approximately for fiscal from approximately for fiscal the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to increased lease income which is not offset by cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal but decreased as a percentage of net revenues to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to additional compensation costs stemming primarily from the growth of our internal sales force  costs related to introducing our endless summer patio heater product and additional costs associated with operating a public company including investor relations and other professional fees 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues was due primarily to the fact that a significant portion of our selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed and  as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses increased at a slower rate than net revenues 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal depreciation expense increased by million to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal primarily due to the increase in the number of cylinder displays and the commencement of depreciation on cylinders held under operating lease agreements 
the increase in cylinder displays was due to our purchase of approximately million of cylinder displays in may which we previously leased under an operating lease and our ongoing purchase of additional cylinders and cylinder displays to support growth in our installed base of retail locations 
our purchase of computer technology also impacted depreciation expense to a lesser extent 
amortization expense increased by  to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal principally due to the increased amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisitions of propane cylinder exchange locations

in fiscal  non recurring charges were approximately  consisting primarily of the write down of facilities and equipment purchased to support the vertically integrated business model 
there were no nonrecurring charges in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense decreased to approximately  for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense resulted from the repayment of substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness in may with proceeds from our initial public offering 
the interest expense for fiscal is a result of borrowings under our credit facility and capital lease obligations incurred primarily to acquire computer technology 
other  net 
other  net decreased to approximately  of income for the fiscal year ended july  from approximately  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the loss on disposal of property and equipment of approximately  recorded in fiscal which was offset by increased interest income from excess cash balances and various notes receivable 
loss on investee 
loss on investee decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal  which reflects the application of the equity method of accounting to our convertible loan to bison valve

we recognized our portion of the loss in the joint venture  approximately  for the period ended july  at july   we had advances outstanding of million to r tech 
in june  we amended and increased our existing bank credit facility with bank of america the credit facility 
the amended credit facility consists of three separate facilities a million revolving line of credit for general corporate purposes  a million seasonal line for general corporate purposes available from july through november  and a million term loan facility 
the credit facility requires us to meet certain covenants  including minimum net worth and cash flow requirements 
we have received a waiver from the bank for our non compliance with certain financial covenants as of and for the three months and year ended july   and the bank agreed to reset the covenants based upon the company s projections for fiscal and fiscal the credit facility is collateralized by a lien on substantially all of our assets

at july  the interest rate on the revolver and seasonal line was  while the rate on the term loan was 
the revolver expires in november  while the term facility requires quarterly principal payments of million  together with accrued interest  beginning october and continuing through april at july   the balance on the credit facility was approximately million 
in conjunction with the credit facility  we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million as a partial hedge of our variable interest rate debt 
the purpose of the swap is to fix interest rates on variable rate debt and to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
under the swap agreement  which expires in july  we pay a fixed rate of and receive a rate equivalent to the one month libor 
we anticipate that our total capital expenditures for fiscal  excluding acquisitions  will be approximately million  and will relate primarily to cylinders  cylinder displays and computer technology 
our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the foreseeable future will change depending on the rate of our expansion  our operating results and any other adjustments in our operating plan as needed in response to competition  acquisition opportunities or unexpected events 
we believe that our existing borrowing capacity under the credit facility  together with the remaining proceeds from the private common and preferred stock offerings and cash provided by operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements through fiscal however  there can be no assurance that we will not seek or require additional capital in the future as a result of expansion or otherwise  or that such additional capital will be available on terms that are not dilutive to our current shareholders 
recent developments on september   we completed the private placement of  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock to two institutional investors under common management and three individuals  including billy d 
prim  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  and andrew j 
filipowski  our vice chairman  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the shares of series a convertible preferred stock accrue a cumulative annual dividend through september   a annual dividend from september  through september  and a dividend thereafter 
the dividend is payable in cash or in shares of common stock valued based on the average closing price of our common stock on the date the shares are authorized to be issued 
the shares of series a convertible preferred stock are convertible into shares of common stock at the option of the holder at any time after september  and  if the market price of the common stock over a prescribed pricing period is at least of the then existing conversion price  at our option at any time after september  the conversion price is initially  but if we do not meet a prescribed earnings target for our fiscal year ending july   the conversion price will be deemed to have initially been the greatest of i  ii book value per share of the common stock as of september  as determined in good faith by us or iii the closing bid price per share of the common stock on september  in addition  the conversion price is subject to adjustment for organic changes and for certain issuances for consideration per share below the then existing conversion price 
the holders of the shares of series a convertible preferred stock have certain registration rights 
on october   we completed the acquisition of quickship  inc  a retail shipping service company based in lenexa  kansas 
quickship  our wholly owned subsidiary  provides consumers with a convenient  full service  in store postal and parcel shipping depot and provides retailers with an additional revenue source 
currently  quickship offers its service at over retail locations in states  and we intend to expand the number of locations to include many of those currently offering blue rhino cylinder exchange and other products 
the aggregate purchase price  including certain acquisition costs  was approximately million of which approximately million was paid in cash and deferred payments  with the balance of million paid in the form of series a convertible preferred stock at per share 
in addition  we issued a five year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
quickship is not expected to have a material impact on our operating results for fiscal seasonality we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and net income loss 
historically  our revenues have been highest in our third and fourth quarters  which include the majority of the grilling season  and lowest in our first and second quarters  which include the winter months 
we expect that our acquisition of uniflame will result in the future in increased revenues for our first quarter  which includes the months in which uniflame historically has shipped the majority of its products 
sustained periods of poor weather  particularly in the spring and summer seasons  can negatively impact our revenues 
our rate of establishing new retail locations and expenses incurred in anticipation of increased sales also cause quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations 
accordingly  the results of operations in any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our revenues  cost of sales or our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
price of propane as a result of the recent and dramatic increase in fuel prices  the costs of propane and diesel fuel are currently at historically high levels 
if fuel costs remain inflated for an extended period  our gross margins and results of operations could be negatively affected due to additional costs that may not be fully recovered through an increase in our price to our customers 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which was effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
was amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the provisions of the statements require the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and the measurement of those instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair market value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designed as part of a hedge transaction  and if so  the type of hedge transaction 
we are required to and will adopt the standards in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab no 
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies 
sab no 
is required to be implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal we do not expect the application of sab no 
to have any impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our borrowings under our bank credit facility 
this facility bears interest based on libor 
the facility is collateralized by cylinders held under operating leases with our independent distributors 
the operating leases currently yield of the cylinder value monthly approximately annually and continue until either party terminates upon days written notice to the other party 
upon any significant increase in libor  we would attempt to renegotiate the operating leases with our independent distributors mitigating the interest rate exposure on the majority of the notes payable to the bank 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such renegotiations or that we will be able to mitigate any or all of the interest rate risk 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
a swap agreement is a contract to exchange floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amount 
in fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million as a partial hedge of our variable interest rate debt 
under the swap agreement  which expires on july  we pay a fixed rate of and receive a rate equivalent to the one month libor 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents and investments in investment grade  highly liquid investments consisting of money market instruments  bank certificates of deposit and overnight investments in commercial paper 
all of our transactions are conducted and accounts are denominated in us dollars and as such we do not currently have exposure to foreign currency risk
