the company maintains a system of internal accounting policies  procedures and controls intended to provide reasonable assurance  at the appropriate cost  that transactions are executed in accordance with company s authorization and are properly recorded and reported in the consolidated financial statements  and that assets are adequately safeguarded 
the company s operations are largely conducted through its subsidiaries  corporacion pipasa  sa and subsidiaries pipasa and corporacion as de oros  sa and subsidiaries as de oros 
the company  through its subsidiaries  represents the largest poultry company in costa rica with a market share of approximately of the chicken meat market in costa rica 
the subsidiaries primary business is derived from the production and sales of broiler chickens  processed chicken by products  commercial eggs  and pre mixed feed and concentrate for livestock and domestic animals 
pipasa  founded in  is the largest poultry company in costa rica with approximately a market share of the chicken meat market in costa rica 
as de oros  founded in  is costa rica s second largest poultry producer  comprising approximately of the country s poultry market and is one of the leaders in the costa rican animal feed market with a market share 
as de oros also owns and operates a chain of fried chicken quick service restaurants in costa rica called restaurantes as de oros 
the company s subsidiaries own a total of urban and rural outlets throughout costa rica  three modern processing plants and three animal feed plants 
due to similar business activities  the combined operations of the subsidiaries permit the company to achieve operational efficiencies 
seasonality the company s subsidiaries have historically experienced and have come to expect seasonal fluctuations in net sales and results of operations 
the company s subsidiaries have generally experienced higher sales and operating results in the first and second quarters of the fiscal year 
this variation is primarily the result of holiday celebrations during this season  in which costa ricans prepare traditional meals  which include dishes with chicken as the main ingredient 
the company expects this seasonal trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
environment the company has been and is practicing sustainable environmental policies such as reforesting  processing and recycling its waste  producing organic fertilizer  building oxidation lagoons and sewage treatment plants 
the company s compliance with environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
for the next fiscal period  the company intends to invest approximately  in improving its sewage treatment and rendering plants 
at the present time  the company is not subject to any material costs for compliance with any environmental laws in any jurisdiction in which it operates 
however  in the future  the company could become subject to material costs to comply with new environmental laws or environmental regulations in jurisdictions in which it might conduct business 
at the present time  the company cannot assess the potential impact of any such potential environmental regulations 
year readiness the year issue is the result of computer programs and other business systems being written using two digits rather than four digits to represent the year 
many of the time sensitive applications and business systems of the company and its business partners may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in system failure or disruption of operations 
the company believes it has been able to achieve year readiness for its internal systems 
the company has also developed a plan of communication with significant business partners to obtain appropriate assurances that the company s operations will not be disrupted through these relationships and that year issues have been resolved by significant business partners in a timely manner 
the company believes that it has satisfactorily resolved all significant year problems and that the related costs have not been material 
however  estimates of year related costs at the beginning of the year are based on numerous assumptions  including  but not limited to  the continued availability of certain resources  the ability to acquire accurate information regarding third party suppliers and the ability to correct all relevant applications and third party modification plans 
there is no guarantee that the estimates will be achieved and actual costs could differ materially from those anticipated 
moreover  the failure of a major vendor s systems to operate properly with respect to the year problem on a timely basis or a year conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
information systems and technology the company s subsidiaries have undergone significant strategic upgrades in application systems in order to improve business processes 
merchandising  production planning  and financial systems were selected for improved business functionality and are vendor certified as year compliant 
the human resources and financial systems were implemented during and  respectively 
all critical applications were tested to ensure compliance 
additionally  the hardware and communications infrastructure has been inventoried  assessed  and  where necessary  upgraded and tested 
the remediation phase was complete by the end of fiscal year testing was performed concurrently with remediation activities and final testing was substantially complete in the same schedule 
the company s operations are dependent on the year readiness of third parties 
the company relies on third party suppliers for infrastructure elements  such as telephone services  electric power  water  and banking facilities  as well as merchandise suppliers 
the vendor relations area of the project refers to the year status evaluation of key merchandise and service vendors 
as part of the year initiative  merchandise and service vendors have been surveyed to determine their readiness and the company is in the process of obtaining or negotiating to obtain adequate assurances from such vendors 
in addition  because the company has a select group of merchandise vendors  the company has established contingency plans to confront any shortage of these products or services in the event of supplier delivery delay or failure 
although the company has not been put on notice that any known third party s problem will not be resolved  the company has limited information and no assurance that any additional information concerning the year readiness of third parties will be made available 
the resulting risks of the company s business are very difficult to assess  however  the inability to obtain merchandise from one or more key vendors on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company is developing contingency plans and identifying what actions would be required if a critical system  service or merchandise supplier were not year compliant 
to date  the company has spent approximately  to complete the year project  which was funded through operating cash flows and external financing 
operating costs related to year compliance projects will be incurred over several quarters and will be expensed as costs are incurred 
costs associated with business system solutions for improved business processes are not included in these amounts since they will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or operating results 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the work were based on management s best estimates  which were derived from numerous assumptions about future events  including but not limited to  the availability of certain resources and third party compliance information 
past expenditures in relation to total estimated costs should not be considered or relied on as a basis for estimating progress to completion for any element of the year project 
the company presently believes  that upon the remediation of its business software applications  hardware  and other equipment with embedded technology  the year issue will not present a materially adverse risk to the company s future consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and capital resources 
however  if such remediation is not completed in a timely manner or the level of timely compliance by key suppliers or vendors is not sufficient  the year issue could have a material impact on the company s operations including but not limited to  failure to or delays in delivery of merchandise resulting in a loss of the company s business 
results of operations the company s operations resulted in diluted earnings per share for the year ended september   compared to and during fiscal and  respectively

transactions subsequent to the acquisition of this subsidiary have been eliminated in consolidation 
sales and cost of sales  for fiscal years and  have been restated to reflect the change in the method of accounting for sales and purchases to integrated producers 
integrated producers are local farms who raise and feed poultry on behalf of the company

during fiscal  management decided to change the breed of its reproduction hens in order to improve production yields 
this change in breeders  which temporarily affected the incubation rates  has been stabilized into normal yields during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which has resulted in weight gain and improved conversion amount of feed per pound of grown meat 
along with the improvement of technical yields came the reduction in international prices of grains  specifically soy bean meal and corn

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk management the company imports all of its corn  the primary ingredient in chicken feed  from the united states of america 
fluctuations in the price of corn may significantly affect the company s gross profit margin 
the company purchases approximately l 
million of corn monthly through the chicago board of trade cbot 
the price of corn and soybean meal  like most grain commodities  is fairly volatile and requires consistent and daily hedging in order to minimize the effect of price increases on the company s profit margin 
the company has been actively hedging its exposure to corn price fluctuations since the company evaluates  on a daily basis  the prices of corn and soybean meal 
all hedging activities are supervised by the hedging committee  whose members are officers and employees  which have received training at the cbot and attend regular seminars on commodities hedging strategies 
the committee consists of financial analysts  the financial director and the financial vice president and transactions are approved by the executive president 
the committee meets at least once a month to evaluate the company s exposure to corn and soybean meal price fluctuations 
the company s strategy is to hedge against price increases in corn and soybean meal  the company is not involved in speculative trading 
contracts range from one month to six months 
the company will buy directly from the spot market if market conditions are favorable  but as a general rule  the company purchases most of its corn through contracts 
the company s hedging strategy is set in its annual budget  which determines how much corn and soybean meal the company will need and the price the company must pay in order to meet budget forecasts 
the company uses an internal pricing model to prepare sensitivity analysis 
the company bases its target prices on the worst case price assumptions ie high corn prices 
the prices paid by the company for corn were below its budgeted prices for the year ended september  the company has a  credit line with futures usa  inc fimat and draws upon this credit line to cover its initial margin deposit 
the interest rate paid on this line of credit averages an annual rate of less than on drawn amounts 
the company is in frequent contact with its brokers at least three to four times a day and receives advice from the brokers corn experts 
the company s monthly soybean meal purchases average approximately  the hedging strategies for soybean meal purchases are identical to that of corn purchases  except that the company purchases its soybean meal through a costa rican company  inolasa  in which the company holds a equity ownership 
in costa rica  there is a tax for soybean meal imports  which is not levied if purchased through inolasa 
if for any reason inolasa cannot deliver the soybean meal to the company  the company can buy its soybean meal directly from the cbot 
thus far  the company has never had to purchase soybean meal directly from the cbot 
exchange rate risk management the company makes us dollar payments for the majority of its raw materials and bank facilities 
this us dollar expense component is not unique to the company  as all poultry producers in central america must rely on us companies for raw materials such as corn  soybean meal and reproduction birds 
given its us dollar exposure  the company actively manages its currency exchange rate risk 
the company uses a financial model to determine the best strategy to mitigate against the devaluation of the currency of costa rica  the colon  against the us dollar 
the company systematically increases its annual sales prices by a rate that is consistent with the colon devaluation against the us dollar 
for the fiscal years ended september   and  the national devaluation rates were  and respectively  and correspondingly  the company increased its prices  and  respectively 
management believes that the company s strong market will allow for this type of price increase without sacrificing long term demand and market share 
the company has successfully passed along such price increases for the last five years 
management plans to increase its export operations in order to increase its us dollar revenues  as all export sales are made in us dollars 
for the fiscal year ended september   exports increased  of us  compared to exports for the same period in in addition to fluctuations in the price of corn and soybean meal  the company has exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates  as payments for imported corn  soybean meal  reproduction birds and bank facilities are in us dollars 
the company s finance division has the responsibility of monitoring economic and industrial trends that influence foreign exchange levels 
this division examines areas such as poultry gross national product  gross national product gnp  inflation  devaluation  export and import growth rates  growth in real wages  unemployment and population rates in costa rica 
raw material purchases have an average payment period of days  hence exchange rate risk is for four months 
during this time  accounts are paid and costs are updated to reflect new exchange rates 
in the event of a severe devaluation of the colon  or increases in international prices  the company may be able to increase sales prices to recuperate its foreign exchange losses 
in addition  all of the company s exports are denominated in us dollars even exports within central america 
management expects that the strategy to increase exports will increase the company s us dollar revenues 
the company uses a model to determine the maximum devaluation possible before considering whether or not to incur additional us based debt 
in effect  the company borrows in us dollars when economically proven to be less expensive than borrowing in colones
