item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition except for historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our future results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not specifically limited to the ability to develop and introduce cost effective new products in a timely manner  developments in current or future litigation  our ability to successfully manufacture and sell significant quantities of equipment on a timely basis  as well as the other risks detailed in this section and in the sections entitled results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  and cautionary statements and risk factors 
overview we develop  manufacture and market worldwide solid imaging systems designed to rapidly produce physical objects from the digital output of solid or surface data from computer aided design and manufacturing cad cam and related computer systems 
our systems include sla tm stereolithography apparatus equipment and thermojet tm solid object printers 
sla industrial systems use our proprietary stereolithography sl technology  a solid imaging process which uses a laser beam to expose and solidify successive layers of photosensitive epoxy resin until the desired object is formed to precise specifications in epoxy or acrylic resin 
sl produced parts can be used for concept models  engineering prototypes  patterns and masters for molds  consumable tooling or short run manufacturing of final product  among other applications 
sl technology can provide users with significant product development time savings  cost reductions and improved quality  compared to traditional modeling  tooling and pattern making techniques 
in addition  material functionality can produce more durable parts  which can be used for rapid manufacturing 
we provide a majority of our sla system customers  either directly or through our network of authorized distributors  with a variety of on site maintenance services and processing materials 
thermojet solid object printers employ hot melt ink jet technology to build models in successive layers using our proprietary thermoplastic material 
these printers  about the size of an office copier  are designed for operation in engineering and design office environments 
designers  engineers  and other users of cad cam utilities can incorporate the printers into office networks as a shared resource  to rapidly produce models of products under development for design concept communication and validation 
in addition  the thermojet solid object printer output can be used as patterns and molds and  when combined with other secondary processes  can produce parts with representative end use properties 
we provide a majority of our thermojet printer customers  either directly or through our network of authorized distributors  with on site maintenance services 
we have sold  systems since and our customers include major corporations in a broad range of industries including manufacturers of automotive  aerospace  computer  electronic  consumer and medical products 
our revenues are generated by product and service sales 
product sales are comprised of the sale of systems and related equipment  materials  software  and other component parts  as well as rentals of systems 
service sales include revenues from a variety of on site maintenance services  customer training  services provided by our technology centers and licensing of d keltool r process and support services 
recent developments during  we introduced several new products to expand the use and applications of our solid imaging systems 
at the top of the product line  we launched the sla system in early  a premium priced high performance sla industrial system 
this system increases the speed of producing solid images and provides for high quality resolution 
the thermojet solid object printer was also introduced late in the first quarter  as a replacement for the actua tm the thermojet printer produces solid images significantly faster than its predecessor with improved reliability and has a list price below that of the former model 
in addition  we launched a series of new materials to support our new and existing systems see part i  item business  products and services  recent product introductions on page 
as part of our strategy to expand the use of solid object printing and to improve the returns from recurring revenue streams from materials  we commenced manufacturing of our own proprietary materials for the thermojet printer at our facility in grand junction  colorado 
during the first two quarters of  we incurred substantial net losses and our revenue did not increase compared to the same period in during this period  our president also resigned 
in addition  difficulties were encountered in the launch of the sla system along with other operational issues which led to certain actions by management late in the second quarter of these actions included realignment of several management positions  exiting facilities and legal structure reorganization 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements on page f in august  we retained an outside firm  regent pacific management corporation regent pacific  to review our operations and strategic direction 
also during the third quarter  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer page resigned 
upon completion of the review by regent pacific  we undertook certain operational changes and replaced certain key executives see note of notes to consolidated financial statements on page f 
in conjunction with this program  executives of regent pacific filled certain key executive positions including chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and vice president of sales and marketing see part iii  item certain relationships and related transactions on page 
additionally  regent pacific took additional steps to assist us in further developing and implementing an operating plan to improve our overall performance 
implementation of major components of this operating plan  including measures designed to result in margin improvements  operating savings and workforce reductions were initiated in the fourth quarter of  with the initial impact of these reductions occurring in the first quarter of this is a forward looking statement and is subject to uncertainties 
for example  the plan may not be completely implemented in the expected timeframe  or may not be as effective as anticipated 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items from the company s statements of operations to total revenues percent of total revenues years ended december  sales products services total sales cost of sales products services total cost of sales total gross profit gross profit products gross profit services selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses other income loss from operations other income and expense income tax benefit expense net income loss the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  total revenues attributable to each of the company s major products and services groups in thousands products systems and related equipment    materials    other    total products    services maintenance    other    total services    total sales    products systems and related equipment material other total products services maintenance other total services total sales page compared to sales 
sales in were million  a decrease of from the million recorded in sales consist of sla systems and thermojet printers  related equipment  software  related component parts  system rentals  materials  and the ongoing servicing of systems 
system sales in increased million or to million compared to million in the increase in sales relates primarily to a higher level of thermojet printers sold 
the sales of sla machines showed a nominal increase in due to problems associated with the introduction of the sla system early in the year which initially created some confusion in the marketplace relative to customers needs and whether the sla system or other systems would better suit our customers requirements 
these issues were addressed in the latter half of the year and resulted in a higher number of sla units being sold relative to the first half of the year 
the issues relating to the introduction of the sla system have been reduced  and we believe that continued improvements in hardware  software and materials will support market acceptance of this product in the future at a level consistent with that experienced in the latter half of this is a forward looking statement and is subject to uncertainties 
for instance  demand for competitors products may negatively impact sales of our systems 
we sold a total of systems in versus systems in in  our total revenue from europe increased to million from million in this represents and of our total revenue for and  respectively 
we attribute this higher rate of growth relative to the rest of the world to a less mature market for our systems in europe versus the united states and the benefit realized from the acquisition of a major competitor in it is expected that this higher growth level in europe versus the united states will continue into this is a forward looking statement and as with other such statements is subject to uncertainties 
for instance  economic or competitive conditions in europe could negatively impact our prospects for future growth in the region 
system sales may also fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of other factors  including the acceptance and reliability of new products in the market  status of world economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  impact of changing technology  and the timing of product shipments 
due to the high price and gross margin of certain systems  the acceleration or delay of a small number of shipments from one quarter to another can significantly affect the results of operations for the quarters involved 
material sales in increased million to million versus in this is due primarily to higher material sales for both the sla systems and thermojet printers 
approximately three quarters of our revenue from sales of material is derived from post installation sales 
as the overall installed base of our machines increases for both types of products and as new and improved materials are developed for both machines  we expect that the revenue growth rate associated with materials will exceed that of machine sales on a percentage basis 
this is a forward looking statement and as with other such statements is subject to uncertainties 
for instance  the total number of systems sold may decrease  leading to a decrease in the total materials sold in the future 
also  continued competitive pricing pressure or negative customer acceptance of our products may impact the total revenue level 
service sales in decreased million  or  compared to  primarily due to increased competition from other providers of service contracts and time and material arrangements  and due to the introduction of tiered pricing plans offered to our customers 
technology center revenues remained at lower levels throughout the year relative to due to a strategic shift in focus to sales support 
also  we sold the st 
paul  minnesota d keltool inserts business  causing a decline in insert revenues in versus in the future  we expect service revenue to increase  due to the growing installed customer base 
however  we believe that competitive forces will continue to limit service revenue growth in the future 
this is a forward looking statement and as with other such statements is subject to uncertainties 
for instance  increased competition may cause our service revenue to decrease further  even though we are servicing a larger number of systems but at a lower level of revenue per system 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million or of sales in compared to million or of sales in product cost of sales including systems and materials as a percentage of product sales increased from in to in this increase was the result of a change in sales mix resulting from selling a higher number of thermojet printers which have a lower gross margin than sla systems 
this was mitigated slightly by a higher overall level of sales in europe which has historically had a higher average selling price for sla systems than elsewhere and a higher level of material sales  some of which have a relatively high gross margin relative to other products 
page though we continue to strive to reduce manufacturing costs and expect costs per unit to decrease as our volume increases  these cost improvements may be offset by continued pricing pressure from competitors 
these are forward looking statements  and as such  are subject to risks and uncertainties 
for example  the acceptance and reliability of new products in the market may result in inventory adjustments and increased factory costs  and the impact of competition on changing economic conditions in the united states and europe may dramatically impact average selling prices 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will not experience significant quarterly fluctuations due to the impact of mix of products  channels  and markets  or that a changing mix over time will not result in a higher average percentage of cost of sales to product sales 
service cost of sales as a percentage of service sales increased slightly to in from in primarily due to continued competitive pricing pressure relating to longer term maintenance contracts and time and materials services 
in addition  field service revenue is decreasing as a result of increased reliability of our systems 
while we continue to contain costs related to field service operations and operate with improved efficiency  we cannot assure you that service cost of sales as a percentage of service revenue will not increase further 
this is a forward looking statement  however  and as such includes certain risks 
for example  the reliability of new products in the market or a further decline in the demand or continued competitive pricing pressures could cause an increase in service costs of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by million or to million in versus million in this is primarily due to an increase of million in marketing expenses in over resulting from the marketing and communication programs undertaken for the introduction of the sla system and the thermojet printer in early this was in addition to an overall buildup of the sales and marketing department that occurred during late and continued into early general and administrative expenses increased million to million in versus million in higher costs were incurred relating to general and administrative expenses as a result of management changes during the year and the lack of strict policies and procedures governing expenditures  which subsequently have been established in connection with the new operating plan implemented during the fourth quarter of  as well as costs associated with the sale of the d keltool insert operations and legal expenses associated with the protection of certain of our patents 
as part of the new operating plan which was implemented in the fourth quarter of  it is expected that costs associated with sg a will decrease in in both dollar amounts and as a percentage of sales 
however  this is a forward looking statement and  as such  includes certain risks 
for example  the acceptance and reliability of new products  or changing economic conditions in the united states and europe may dramatically impact total sales for any particular period  and result in an increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales 
additionally  we may not realize the benefits of the new operating plan in the expected timeframe  or the plan may not be completely implemented in the expected timeframe  or may not be as effective as anticipated 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased in to million  down from million in the decrease in research and development expenses in was primarily a result of significant investment in in new product introduction sla system and thermojet solid object printer 
based on our historical expenditures related to research and development and our current development goals  we anticipate for the foreseeable future  research and development expenses will be equal to approximately of sales 
this is a forward looking statement  however  and  as with any such statement  is subject to risk 
for example  if our total sales for any particular period do not meet our anticipated sales for that year  research and development expenses as a percentage of sales may exceed 
other operating expenses 
during  we incurred million relating to non recurring charges associated with actions taken by management involving certain employee related costs and costs associated with the litigation and settlement costs for the centuri litigation see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements on page f 
operating income loss 
the operating loss in was million or of revenue versus operating income of million or of revenue in the loss relates to lower average gross margins  additional operating expenses associated with realigning our operations  and higher marketing costs incurred relative to interest and other income and expense 
interest and other income and expense decreased by million in compared to this decrease is primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower investment levels in provision for benefit from income taxes 
for  our tax benefit was million or of the pre tax loss  compared to a tax expense of million on pre tax income of million in our effective tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by research credits and the effects of foreign operations 
compared to sales 
sales in were million  an increase of over the million recorded during page product sales in increased million or to million compared to million in the dollar increase was primarily due to improved average selling prices in europe as a result of the eos acquisition  and an improved product mix as the demand for our sla and systems  launched in late  caused a shift to high end stereolithography systems 
a total of systems were sold in compared to systems in orders for our systems in compared to increased significantly in europe and were up in the united states  while orders were down slightly in asia pacific 
in  the united states market was impacted by inefficiencies caused by the changes in our domestic sales organization 
service sales in increased million  or  compared to  primarily as a result of increased maintenance revenues due to the larger installed base of sla systems in the united states and europe 
this increase was offset  in part  by a decline in revenues from our technology centers 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased to million or of sales in compared to million or of sales in product cost of sales as a percentage of product sales improved in  decreasing from in to in this improvement was the result of increased average selling prices in europe  improved product mix to higher end sla systems  continued reductions in overall cost of factory operations  and revenues related to certain royalty agreements 
in addition  cost of sales included inventory adjustments totaling approximately million that were primarily associated with the transition to new products  the eos acquisition  and field service inventories 
service cost of sales as a percentage of service sales decreased to in from in primarily due to the fact that included certain hardware upgrade costs associated with our nt version system software 
in addition  field service costs improved as a result of increased reliability of our systems 
this was offset  in part  by declining revenues in our technology center  increasing costs of sales as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses improved  as a percentage of sales  to of total sales in from in sg a expense increased million or from to  due primarily to increased commissions and sales bonuses resulting from higher sales and profits  costs associated with selling and distributor incentive programs in  and costs related to expanded marketing and communications programs 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses in decreased approximately million or compared to the decrease in r d expenses in was due primarily to the fact that included a write off of acquired in process technology valued at approximately million in connection with the eos acquisition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements on page f  offset in part by increased personnel and experimental material costs related to certain development projects 
operating income loss 
operating income in was of total sales compared to operating loss of of total sales in the improvement in is primarily attributable to inventory write offs and costs associated with the eos acquisition included in  improved average selling prices and product mix  and improving product and service cost of sales  as described above 
interest and other income and expense 
interest and other income and expense decreased by million in compared to this decrease is primarily due to lower interest income 
other expense increased by million in compared to due to various non operating expenses 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
for our provision for income taxes was million or of pre tax income  compared to a tax benefit of million in the effective tax rate was favorably impacted primarily as a result of research credits and the effects of foreign operations 
foreign operations international sales  primarily from europe  accounted for   and of total sales in  and  respectively 
for information with respect to allocation of sales among the company s foreign operations  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements on page f during  our european operations continued to grow and are expected to provide an increasing percentage of our total revenue 
however  this is a forward looking statement and  as with any such statement  is subject to uncertainties 
for example  we may be negatively impacted by foreign currency movements which would limit our growth prospects or put page us at a disadvantage relative to other competitors in the european market 
we also receive a limited portion of our total revenue from asia through distributors and an established sales office 
due to continued economic problems in asia and competitive pressures  we expect our sales to these areas to continue to be limited 
to date  we have not entered into hedging transactions to protect against changes in foreign currency exchange rates  but we are considering doing so for transactions in the future 
however  this is a forward looking statement and  as with any such statement  is subject to uncertainties 
for example  we may determine that it is not appropriate for us to enter into hedging transactions or develop alternative methods to limit our foreign currency exposure 
liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended december in thousands cash and cash equivalents    short term investments   working capital    cash provided by used for operating activities    cash used for investing activities    cash provided by used for financing activities  net cash provided by used for operating activities in  and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the cash flow from operations in was comprised primarily of a net loss of million adjusted for non cash items including depreciation and amortization of million 
in the first quarter of  we sold a portion of our lease portfolio  resulting in a reduction in our lease receivables of million 
net cash used for investing activities in totaled million primarily for property and equipment relating particularly to demonstration equipment for new products  computers and manufacturing equipment required for expansion  license and patent costs 
net cash provided by financing activities in totaling million was the result of cash provided from the exercise of stock options net of long term debt repayments 
in august  we allowed our credit facility with silicon valley bank svb the credit facility to expire 
the credit facility was not utilized during and no amounts were due under the facility at the time of its expiration 
currently  we are in the process of establishing a new facility to provide for working capital requirements in and beyond 
we expect that the new facility will finance future sales growth and be collateralized by a percentage of inventory and accounts receivable 
this is a forward looking statement and is subject to uncertainties 
for example  significant changes in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our ability to secure our primary choice of credit facility alternatives 
we believe that funds generated from operations and existing working capital will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated operating requirements for at least the next months 
from time to time  we consider the acquisition of businesses  products or technologies complementary to our current business  although we have no current commitments or agreements with respect to any such transactions 
should we decide to pursue such a transaction  we may need to borrow additional funds 
on may   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the purchase of up to million shares of our own common stock in the open market and through private transactions 
during  we purchased  shares for approximately  during the first quarter of  we purchased  shares for approximately million 
currently  it is not anticipated that the company will acquire any additional shares under this program 
there were no significant inflationary trends that affected us in we assigned a team to address the issues raised by the introduction of the single european currency euro for initial implementation as of january  and the transition period through to january  we have substantially completed the modifications to our internal systems that will be affected by the initial introduction of the euro during we do not expect that the introduction and use of the euro will materially affect our foreign exchange position nor result in any material increase in cost to us 
page year compliance 
we took several steps to ensure that our computer based systems that require date time calculations were not negatively impacted by miscalculations and system failures on and after the year we evaluated all products sold since inception for year readiness  and provided the results of the analysis and potential impacts and resolutions to our customers 
the necessary upgrade pathways to our customers were completed  and we believe that all products meet basic functionality requirements 
no significant issues have been encountered relating to our products  our internal operating systems  or with any of our suppliers 
there have been no known increases in warranty or other claims by customers as a result of the year transition 
there was no additional impact on prior cost estimates or significant additional costs incurred subsequent to december  relating to this matter and no impact on results of operations  deferred spending  third party relationships  remaining contingencies or legal proceedings 
our cost incurred to prepare for yk issues totaled approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and long term debt 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments with companies with high quality investment ratings or other high quality investments 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on the industrial development bond for our colorado facility  which has a variable interest rate 
we have not entered into any hedging instruments to protect ourselves against future increases in interest rates  which would negatively impact the amount of interest we are required to pay 
however  we do not feel that this risk is significant and we do not plan to attempt to hedge to mitigate this risk in the foreseeable future 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues accounted for of our total revenue in international sales are made primarily from our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are denominated in united states dollars or the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the realized effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in resulted in a  loss
