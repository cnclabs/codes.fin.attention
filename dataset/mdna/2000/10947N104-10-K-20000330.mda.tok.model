accordingly  revenue is recognized as consulting services are performed 
unbilled revenue is recorded for contract services provided for which a billing has not been rendered 
deferred revenue represents the excess of amounts billed over contract costs and expenses incurred 
the timing of revenue is difficult to forecast because the company s sales cycle for certain of its services can be relatively long and is subject to a number of uncertainties  including customers budgetary constraints  the timing of customers budget cycles  customers internal approval processes and general economic conditions 
in addition  as is customary in the industry  the company s engagements  generally  are terminable without a customer penalty 
the company s revenue and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year because of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the rate of hiring and the productivity of revenue generating personnel  the availability of qualified it professionals  the significance of customer engagements commenced and completed during a quarter  the number of business days in the quarter  changes in the relative mix of the company s services  changes in the pricing of the company s services  the timing and the rate of entrance into new geographic or it specialty markets  departures or temporary absences of key revenue generating personnel  the structure and timing of acquisitions  changes in the demand for it services  and general economic factors

the increase in revenues attributed to factors described above was partially offset by a reduced revenue stream from all existing businesses during the second half of attributable to executing the company s plan for reorganizing and the impact of reduced demand for services offered by the company due to the year the company expects to continue to generate lower revenues through the first half of revenue increased  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the prior periods primarily as a result of i the acquisition of the founding companies on april  at the time of the initial public offering  ii the acquisition of three additional companies subsequent to the initial public offering and iii new customer contracts for implementation of erp systems and development of custom applications 
cost of revenue cost of revenue primarily consists of salaries including non billable and training time and benefits for consultants 
the company generally strives to maintain its gross profit margins by offsetting increases in salaries and benefits with increases in billing rates 
cost of revenue increased  for the twelve months ended december  and compared to the respective prior periods due to an increase in variable costs associated with the increased revenue described above 
cost of revenue for reflects costs associated with two fixed fee contracts in dallas  texas which exceeded related revenues by million in million in the fourth quarter of compared to gross margins recorded on the same contracts in the company does not believe that any additional losses associated with the two contracts will be incurred in the year operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs associated with i corporate overhead  ii sales and account management  iii telecommunications  iv human resources  v recruiting and training  and vi other administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or in compared to as a result of personnel added to support the increased volume of business described in the revenue discussion above

market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and currencies of the company s subsidiaries and operations in australia 
revenues from these operations are typically denominated in australian dollars thereby potentially affecting the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows due to fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
however there can be no assurance that a sudden and significant decline in the value of the australian dollar would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates  therefore  the company s results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to the long term debt outstanding 
an immediate percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations over the next fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources effective march   the company established a million credit facility the credit facility with comerica bank 
under terms of the agreement  the credit facility will be used for working capital needs  including issuance of letters of credit  and for general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the credit facility bear an interest rate of prime plus  or the eurodollar rate plus 
the company pays a commitment fee on unused amounts of the credit facility amounting to 
per annum based on the average daily amount by which the commitment amount exceeds the principal amount outstanding during the preceding month 
interest is payable monthly on prime rate borrowings and quarterly or at the end of the applicable interest period for the eurodollar rate borrowings 
the credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all the company s assets including accounts receivable and a pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock of the company s domestic operating subsidiaries 
the credit facility also requires that the company comply with various loan covenants  including i maintenance of certain financial ratios  ii restrictions on additional indebtedness and iii restrictions on liens  guarantees and payments of dividends 
as of  and during the quarters ended september  and december   the company was not in compliance with a certain financial covenant 
comerica bank has agreed to waive the default for both periods 
the credit facility contains provisions requiring mandatory prepayment of outstanding borrowings from the issuance of debt or equity securities for cash  excluding certain equity issued in connection with future acquisitions  and cash realized in connection with permitted asset sales outside of the ordinary course of business 
borrowings outstanding under the credit facility amounted to million at december  as of march  the company has reduced its borrowings under the credit facility to approximately million 
the credit facility expires on march  on march   pursuant to an agreement with strong river investments  inc and montrose investments ltd 
collectively the purchasers  the company sold to the purchasers  shares of the company s common stock for million or per share 
net proceeds to the company amounted to million after related issuance costs 
the company expects to register the common shares sold to the purchasers in april the company and the purchasers further agreed that the company will sell and the purchaser will purchase up to an additional million worth of the company s common stock six months following the initial transaction  subject to certain conditions 
the company is required to make payments in amounting to million related to prior acquisitions 
the company has the option to issue common stock to satisfy up to million of the amounts due 
in addition  the company expects to make contingent payments to the prior owners of cogent and isc related to earn out agreements 
the amount of the contingent payments is expected to be in a range from million 
the company expects that a significant portion of the amounts due will be satisfied upon the issuance of common stock 
the company s principal sources of ongoing liquidity are the cash flows of its subsidiaries and the cash available from the credit facility 
the company intends to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable 
the company expects to fund future acquisitions through the issuance of additional equity  as well as through a combination of working capital  cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility 
the company believes that cash flow from operations  proceeds from the issuance of stock and borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund its requirements for the foreseeable future 
inflation due to the relatively low levels of inflation experienced in the last three years  inflation did not have a significant effect on the results of operations of any of the founding companies in those periods 
uncertainties nature of projects many of the company s projects are billed on a fixed fee basis 
the company s failure to estimate accurately the resources and related expenses required for a fixed fee project or failure to complete contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project plan upon which the fixed fee contract is based could have a material adverse effect on the company 
many of the company s engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of its clients businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify 
the company s failure or inability to meet a client s expectations in the performance of its services could result in a material adverse change to the client s operations and therefore could give rise to claims against the company or damage the company s reputation 
in addition  the company is exposed to various risks and liabilities associated with placing its employees and consultants in the workplaces of others  including possible claims of errors and omissions  misuse of client proprietary information  misappropriation of funds  discrimination and harassment  theft of client property  other criminal activity or torts and other claims 
although brightstar has not experienced any material claims of these types  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such claims in the future 
if claims are successfully brought against the company as a result of the company s performance on a project  or if the company s reputation is damaged  there could be a material adverse effect on the company 
additionally  the company could continue to experience adverse effects resulting from the integration of acquired companies 
reorganization the company has undergone significant managerial and operational change in connection with its corporate reorganization 
although the company believes the reorganization will provide long term benefits  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
in addition  although the company believes it has recognized substantially all of the costs of the reorganization  additional costs may be incurred as the reorganization proceeds 
reorganization s effect on sales the company began to execute its plan for reorganizing brightstar on january  as part of the plan  the individual sales groups from the brightstar subsidiaries were combined into a consolidated brightstar sales group 
prior to january  most of these salespeople sold only a subset of brightstar s service offerings and in many cases only a single service 
the company has undertaken a training program to train these salespeople to sell all of the brightstar service offerings 
however  there can be no assurance that these salespeople have the expertise and ability to successfully sell the entire portfolio of brightstar services 
any disruption to the brightstar sales group caused by the reorganization could disrupt the company s ability to generate revenues and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
decrease in the market for services due to the year the purchasing patterns of clients were affected by year issues as companies expended significant resources to correct their current systems for year compliance 
these expenditures resulted in reduced funds available to purchase services offered by the company  which had an adverse effect on the company in the second half of and is expected to continue through the first half of forward looking information management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements  other than statements of historical facts  included in this md a regarding the company s financial position  business strategy and plans  and objectives of management of the company for future operations are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors  many of which are outside of the company s control  that could cause actual results to materially differ from such statements 
while the company believes that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable  it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in predicting certain important factors  especially the timing and magnitude of technological advances  the performance of recently acquired businesses  the prospects for future acquisitions  the possibility that a current customer could be acquired or otherwise be affected by a future event that would diminish their information technology requirements  the competition in the information technology industry and the impact of such competition on pricing  revenues and margins  the degree to which business entities continue to outsource information technology and business processes  uncertainties surrounding budget reductions or changes in funding priorities or existing government programs and the cost of attracting and retaining highly skilled personnel
