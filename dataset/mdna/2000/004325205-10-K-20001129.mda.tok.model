item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company develops  publishes  markets and distributes video and computer games for use with game consoles  both dedicated and portable  and pcs on a worldwide basis 
the company owns and operates four software development studios located in the us and the us where it develops its own software  and also a motion capture studio and a recording studio in the us the company also contracts with independent software developers to create software for it 
the company publishes  or releases to the public under its brand names  software developed by it as well as by third party developers 
the company distributes its software directly to retailers in north america  the uk  germany  france  spain and australia 
the company also distributes software developed and published by third parties and develops and publishes strategy guides relating to the company s software 
the video and computer games industry is characterized by rapid technological changes  which have resulted in successive introductions of increasingly advanced game consoles and pcs 
as a result of the rapid technological shifts  no single game console or pc system has achieved long term dominance in the video and computer games market 
therefore  the company must continually anticipate game console cycles and its research and development group must develop programming tools and engines necessary for the development of software for emerging hardware systems 
the company s revenues have traditionally been derived from sales of software for the then popular game consoles 
accordingly  the company s performance has been  and is expected in the future to be  materially adversely affected by platform transitions 
as a result of the industry transition to bit and bit game consoles which commenced in  the company s software sales during fiscal  and were significantly lower than in fiscal and the company s inability to predict accurately the timing of such transition resulted in material losses in fiscal and the video and computer games industry is currently experiencing another platform transition from bit and bit to bit game consoles and related software 
the company believes that sales of new bit and bit game consoles have peaked and will continue to decrease substantially in future periods 
this transition during fiscal resulted in increased competition  fewer hit titles capable of achieving significant sales levels and increased price weakness for non hit titles 
the software transition has also resulted in industry wide software pricing weakness which impacted the company s operating results during fiscal and is anticipated to adversely impact the company in fiscal  as the market shifts from the current game consoles to the next generation systems that were launched by sega in fiscal and sony in fiscal  and which are anticipated to be launched in north america by nintendo and microsoft in the fall of the company will continue to support playstation  dreamcast and gameboy color and also will begin to publish for playstation and gameboy color advanced 
the company will not release new n titles in fiscal and will release fewer titles for sega s dreamcast 
the company expects its portfolio of titles for to be dominated by playstation  game cube  x box and gameboy advanced 
although the company does not believe that the installed base of next generation platforms in will support software sales at the levels obtained in before the current platform transition  when the transition is complete the company anticipates that the eventual installed base of bit systems will provide a larger market for its software at improved gross margins based on the predominance of cd product rather than cartridges as compared to there can be no assurance that newly introduced eg  sony s playstation and sega s dreamcast  or the announced eg  nintendo s game cube and microsoft s x box bit game consoles will achieve commercial success similar to that of the bit playstation or bit n or the timing of such success  if achieved 
see liquidity and capital resources below  and factors affecting future performance industry trends  platform transitions and technological change may adversely affect the company s revenues and profitability 
the rapid technological advances in game consoles have significantly changed the look and feel of software as well as the software development process 
currently  the process of developing software is extremely complex and the company expects it to become more complex and expensive in the future with the advent of the more powerful next generation game consoles 
according to the company s estimates  the average development time for a title is between and months and the average development cost for a title is between million and million 
the average development time for the company s software for portable systems is currently between six and nine months and the average development cost for a title is between  and  approximately  and of the company s gross revenues in fiscal  and  respectively was derived from software developed by its studios 
see factors affecting future performance increased product development costs may adversely affect profitability 
the company s revenues in any period are generally driven by the titles released by the company in that period 
in fiscal and in the past  the company has experienced delays in the introduction of new titles  which has had a negative impact on its results of operations 
it is likely that some of the company s future titles will not be released in accordance with the company s operating plans for a period  in which event its results of operations and profitability in that period would be negatively affected 
see liquidity and capital resources below  and factors affecting future performance revenues and liquidity are dependent on timely introduction of new titles 
revenues from the company s bit and bit software in fiscal were significantly below the company s expectations due  in large part  to lower than expected sell through at retail of certain of the company s products  delays in the introduction of new titles  the decline of the market for n software and the company s prior emphasis on the n platform  and the slowdown in the rate of growth of the installed base of bit and bit game consoles 
in response to the foregoing trends  in fiscal the company determined not to release additional titles for the n in addition  the company substantially increased its sales allowances to address the effects on the company of increased competition and industry wide weakness in cartridge based software sales and slower than expected sales of certain products 
the decline in sales was partially offset by revenues from software for the sega dreamcast bit game console which is a cd based delivery system 
the company recorded a net loss of approximately million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to net earnings of approximately million and million in fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
in addition to the factors discussed above  which significantly and adversely impacted net revenues  the company s operating results for fiscal were also negatively impacted by increased research and development expenses and the write off of the remaining goodwill of million from its comic book publishing operations 
as the company continues to manage through the current game console transition and prepares to compete in the software market for next generation game consoles  it is necessary that the company meet its product release schedule and sales projections and manage its operational expenditures at the planned levels for the next four quarters in order to generate sufficient liquidity to fund its operations 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
the company s results of operations in the future will be dependent in large part on the timing and rate of growth of the software market for bit and other emerging game consoles and the company s ability to identify  develop and timely publish  in accordance with its product release schedule  software that performs well in the marketplace 
results of operations the following table shows certain statements of consolidated operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended august  domestic revenues foreign revenues net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses marketing and sales general and administrative research and development goodwill writedown litigation recovery total operating expenses earnings loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense earnings loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings loss net revenues the company s gross revenues were derived from the following product categories portable software bit software bit software bit software computer games software other total the numbers in this chart do not give effect to sales credits and allowances granted by the company since the company does not track such credits and allowances by product category 
accordingly  the numbers presented may vary materially from those that would be disclosed if the company were able to present such information as a percentage of net revenues 
the company s net revenues decreased to approximately million for the year ended august  from approximately million for the year ended august  predominantly due to delays in the introduction of new titles  lower than anticipated sales of certain of the company s released products  the decline of the market for n software and the company s prior emphasis on the n platform and significant slowdown in the rate of growth of the installed base of bit and bit game consoles 
in addition  net revenues were further negatively impacted by increased sales allowances for returns  price concessions and price protection relating primarily to bit and bit software 
these sales decreases were partially offset by increased sales of the company s dreamcast related software which aggregated of gross revenues for fiscal the company anticipates that its titles currently scheduled for introduction throughout fiscal will be released as planned  however  no assurance can be given that these titles will be released in accordance with the company s current expectations 
assuming timely shipment of the company s titles  the company s revenues from the sale of software are anticipated to grow in fiscal as compared to fiscal  however  the company anticipates that  for fiscal as a whole  its growth rate will be lower than its fiscal growth rate of 
if the company does not release new titles as planned in fiscal  the company s net revenues could be materially and negatively impacted and the company could incur losses from operations 
the company anticipates that its mix of domestic and foreign net revenues will continue to be affected by the content of titles released by the company to the extent such titles are positioned for the domestic market 
the increase in the company s net revenues from million for the year ended august  to million for the year ended august  was predominantly due to increased revenues from sales of the company s bit software 
sales of nintendo s n software represented of the gross revenues in fiscal a significant portion of the company s revenues in any quarter are generally derived from software first released in that quarter or in the immediately preceding quarter 
see factors affecting future performance revenues and liquidity are dependent on timely introduction of new titles and the company s future success is dependent on its ability to release hit titles

in fiscal  wwf war zone for multiple platforms  nfl quarterback club for the n  forsaken for multiple platforms and extreme g for the n accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of the company s gross revenues 
the company also licenses intellectual properties from third parties  such as the nfl 
these licenses generally permit the company to market titles utilizing the licensors properties in exchange for royalty payments 
the company s license for the wwf properties expired in november and was not renewed 
sales of titles using wwf properties aggregated and of gross revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the company is substantially dependent on the game console developers as the sole developers of the game consoles marketed by them  as the sole licensors of the proprietary information and technology needed to develop software for those hardware platforms and  in the case of nintendo and sony  as the sole manufacturers of software for the hardware platforms marketed by them 
for the years ended august   and  the company derived  and of its gross revenues  respectively  from sales of nintendo compatible software   and of its gross revenues  respectively  from sales of playstation software and  less than  and less than of its gross revenues  respectively  from sales of sega compatible software 
the company has a license to develop  and release  titles for sony s playstation and sega s dreamcast platforms introduced in the us in the first quarter of fiscal and  respectively 
the company has released titles for dreamcast in fiscal and plans to release five additional titles in fiscal as for sony s playstation  released in the fall of  the company expects to release titles in fiscal  the first title was launched in november and the second will be released in december gross profit gross profit is primarily impacted by the percentage of sales of cd software as compared to the percentage of sales of cartridge software 
gross profit may also be significantly impacted from time to time by the level of returns and price protection and concessions to retailers and distributors to which the company provides discounts and allowances 
the percentage of foreign sales and the percentage of foreign sales to third party distributors may impact gross margins as well 
the company s margins on sales of cd software currently  playstation  dreamcast and pcs are higher than those on cartridge software currently  n and game boy color primarily because cd software manufacturing costs are significantly lower 
the company s margins on foreign software sales to third party distributors are approximately one third lower than those on sales that the company makes directly to foreign retailers 
gross profit decreased to million of net revenues for the year ended august  from million of net revenues for the year ended august  the dollar decrease is predominantly due to the decreased sales levels  the establishment of increased sales allowances for returns  price concessions and price protection  as well as lower average net selling prices per unit obtained during the platform transition period of fiscal as compared to fiscal gross profit increased to million of net revenues for the year ended august  from million of net revenues for the year ended august  predominantly due to increased unit sales and higher average unit selling prices of the company s software 
the company s gross profit in fiscal will continue to be dependent in large part on the timing and rate of growth of the software market for bit and other emerging game consoles  the rate of distribution of the sony playstation and the company s ability to identify  develop and timely publish  in accordance with its product release schedule  software that sells through at retail

operating expenses marketing and selling expenses decreased to million of net revenues for the year ended august  from million of net revenues for the year ended august  and increased million for fiscal year from million of net revenues for the year ended august  although marketing expenses increased by million for fiscal over fiscal primarily related to increased television and print advertising the increase was offset by lower sales commission expenses recognized on lower revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal  resulting in the overall increase to marketing and selling expenses 
the significant percentage decrease is due to the lower net revenues achieved in the dollar increase in fiscal over fiscal is attributable to higher revenues and more marketing initiatives 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million of net revenues for the year ended august  from million of net revenues for the year ended august  and increased million from million of net revenues for the year ended august  the dollar decrease in fiscal is primarily due to the cost reduction efforts initiated by the company in the second half of fiscal while the increase in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to a higher level of expenses among all functions and within all categories 
research and development expenses increased to million of net revenues for the year ended august  from million of net revenues for the year ended august  and increased million in fiscal over fiscal expenses of million of net revenues 
the dollar increases in fiscal and are primarily attributable to the implementation of the company s strategy to establish its own brands  an increase in the number of internally developed titles  and the increased expense of concurrently developing new game engines and programming tools for the next generation game consoles for nintendo  sony  microsoft and sega while continuing to support the existing platforms and increased personnel cost at the studios 
as of august   the company concluded that the goodwill associated with its comics and strategy guides business was no longer recoverable 
accordingly  the company recorded a million charge to write off the remaining goodwill associated with acclaim comics 
this determination was based on the general deterioration in the comic book and strategy guides publishing industry  the shortened longevity of the characters featured in the company s video games and strategy guides and the inability of the featured characters to generate sufficient positive operating cash flows before any charge for goodwill amortization 
the company will still continue to publish strategy guides to support its game titles 
in fiscal  the company realized a litigation settlement gain of million 
due to the occurrence of various events identified in the related settlement agreement  including an increase in the market value of the company s common stock to a value specified in the settlement agreement  the company s previously recorded contractual obligation was reduced 
the percentage increases in marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses for fiscal is primarily attributable to decreased sales volume

seasonality the company s business is seasonal  with higher revenues and operating income typically occurring during its first  second and fourth fiscal quarters which corresponds to the holiday selling season 
the timing of the delivery of software titles and the release of new products cause material fluctuations in the company s quarterly revenues and earnings  which may cause the company s results to vary from the seasonal patterns of the industry as a whole

if the company does not substantially achieve the overall projected revenue levels for fiscal as reflected in its business operating plans  the company either will require additional financing to fund operations or the company will need to make further significant expense reductions  including  without limitation  the sale of certain assets or the consolidation of certain operations and staff reductions and or the delay  cancellation or reduction of certain product development and marketing programs 
certain of such measures may require third party consents or approvals  including the company s primary lenders  and there can be no such assurance that consents or approvals can be obtained
