ivillage 
com consists of content specific channels organized by subject matter and several shopping areas 
the channels cover leading topics of interest to women online  such as family  health  work  money  food  computers  relationships  shopping  travel  pets and astrology 
we facilitate channel usage by providing common features and functionality within each channel  including experts  chats  message boards and services 
to date  our revenues have been derived primarily from the sale of sponsorship and advertising contracts 
sponsorship and advertising revenues constituted and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sponsorship revenues are derived principally from contracts ranging from one to three years 
sponsorships are designed to support broad marketing objectives  including brand promotion  awareness  product introductions and online research 
sponsorship agreements typically include the delivery of impressions on our web sites and occasionally the design and development of customized sites that enhance the promotional objectives of the sponsor 
an impression is the viewing of promotional material on a web page  which may include banner advertisements  links  buttons or other text or images 
sponsorship revenues are recognized ratably in the period in which the advertisement is displayed  provided that none of our significant obligations remain and the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  at the lesser of the ratio of impressions delivered over total guaranteed impressions or the straight line basis over the term of the contract 
accordingly  to the extent that minimum guaranteed impressions are not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions are met 
as part of our sponsorship deals  certain sponsors who also sell products provide us with a commission on sales of their products generated through our web site 
to date  these amounts have been immaterial 
advertising revenues are derived principally from short term advertising contracts in which we typically guarantee a minimum number of impressions or pages to be delivered to users over a specified period of time for a fixed fee 
advertising revenues are recognized ratably in the period in which the advertisement is displayed  provided that no significant ivillage obligations remain and the collection of the receivable is probable  at the lesser of the ratio of impressions delivered over total guaranteed impressions or the straight line basis over the term of the contract 
to the extent that minimum guaranteed impressions are not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions are achieved 
advertising rates  measured on a cost per thousand impressions basis  or cpms  are dependent on whether the impressions are for general rotation throughout our web sites or for targeted audiences and properties within specific areas of ivillage 
com 
sponsorship and advertising revenues also include barter revenues  which represent exchanges by us of advertising space on our web sites for reciprocal advertising space or traffic on other web sites 
revenues from these barter transactions are recorded as advertising revenues at the estimated fair value of the advertisements delivered  unless the fair value of the goods and services received is more objectively determinable  and are recognized when the advertisements are run on ivillage 
com and its affiliated properties 
barter expenses are recognized at the value of advertisements received when our advertisements are run on the reciprocal web sites or properties  which is typically in the same period as when the advertisements are run on ivillage 
com 
barter expenses are included as part of sales and marketing expenses 
we do not receive cash for the advertisements delivered  nor do we pay for the advertisements received 
typically  these barter transactions have no impact on our cash flows and results of operations 
barter transactions enable us to continue to build strong brand recognition as part of our overall business strategy without expending cash resources 
revenues from barter transactions represented approximately and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that barter revenues will continue to increase in the future although they will decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
with the acquisition of lamaze publishing  we generate additional revenues through advertising placements in its publications  videos  newborn channel satellite broadcasts and e commerce opportunities

in order to fulfill these functions  we recently signed a two year lease for approximately  square feet of warehouse space for ibaby at a facility located in san diego  california 
additionally  we exercised an option to lease an additional  square feet of warehouse space 
our failure to assume effectively and in a timely manner the merchandising  inventory management and order fulfillment functions has and could result in the disruption of the operations of ibaby  including shipment delays 
commerce revenues received from imaternity consist of the sale of maternity clothing and products through its web site

on november   we consummated a secondary offering of  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million 
net cash used in operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from increased net losses and other assets  offset by an increase in deferred revenue and depreciation and amortization expenses 
the increased net loss was primarily due to the continued investment in establishing the ivillage brand on the internet through further investment in content and technology and the commencement of our million marketing campaign 
net cash used in operating activities amounted to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used from to resulted primarily from increasing net losses  offset by the timing of payable settlements and increased depreciation and amortization expense 
net cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december  this compares to net cash used in investing activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities from to resulted primarily from the acquisitions of ibaby and astrology 
net in the first quarter of  the acquisitions of online psychological services  inc and code stone technologies  inc during the second quarter of  and the acquisitions of lamaze publishing and family point inc in august net cash used in investing activities decreased from to  primarily from increased purchases of property and equipment and the million cash portion of the acquisition of our health channel in net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the receipt of million of net proceeds from our initial public offering in march  and million of net proceeds from our secondary public offering consummated in november net cash provided by financing activities was million for the increase from to was primarily due to million of net cash proceeds from the sale of shares of our series e convertible preferred stock  series d convertible preferred stock  and common stock as compared to the million of net cash proceeds from the sale of shares of our series c convertible preferred stock in  inclusive of convertible notes

com in a content license agreement and have entered into a million sponsorship agreement with them 
we recently signed a two year lease for approximately  square feet of warehouse space for ibaby at a facility located in san diego  california 
additionally  we exercised an option to lease an additional  square feet of warehouse space 
as of september   we entered into a financial advisory agreement with allen company incorporated pursuant to which allen company will act as our financial advisor with respect to various matters from time to time 
we paid allen company  upon execution of the agreement 
in february  we executed an amendment to the agreement which extended its term to september  and set forth additional fees payable to allen company upon their provision of certain services to us 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including o market acceptance of our services  o the amount of resources we devote to investments in the ivillage 
com network  including acquisition of other entities  o the resources we devote to marketing  and o the resources we devote to selling our services and brand promotions 
we have experienced a substantial increase in our expenditures since our inception 
the increase in expenditures is consistent with the growth in our operations and staffing 
we anticipate we will continue to evaluate possible investments in businesses  products and technologies  and continue to expand our sales and marketing programs and conduct more aggressive brand promotions  any of which could reduce our liquidity 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal quarters beginning fiscal year the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have an impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows upon the adoption of this standard 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab is not a rule or interpretation of the sec  however  it represents interpretations and practices followed by the division of corporation finance and the office of the chief accountant in administering the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws 
we do not believe that the interpretations outlined in sab will have an impact on our revenue recognition policies 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept or recognize only two digit entries in the date code field 
these systems and software products will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies and governmental agencies may need to be upgraded to comply with year requirements or risk system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business activities 
state of readiness during  we engaged in an assessment of the year readiness of our operating  financial and administrative systems  including the hardware and software that support our systems 
our assessment plan consisted of o quality assurance testing of our internally developed proprietary software  o contacting third party vendors and licensors of material hardware  software and services that are both directly and indirectly related to the delivery of our services to our users  o contacting vendors of third party systems  o assessing repair and replacement requirements  o implementing repair or replacement  o implementation  and o if deemed necessary or appropriate  creating contingency plans in the event of year failures 
our year task force conducted an inventory of and developed testing procedures for all software and other systems that we believed might be affected by year issues 
since third parties developed and currently support many of the systems that we use  a significant part of this effort was to ensure that these third party systems are year compliant 
we confirmed this compliance through a combination of the representation by these third parties of their products year compliance  as well as specific testing of these systems 
costs as of december   we had spent approximately  on year compliance issues 
most of our expenses related to the operating costs associated with time spent by employees and consultants in the evaluation process and year compliance matters generally 
risks to date we are not aware of any year compliance problems relating to our systems that would have had a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition  without taking into account our efforts to avoid or fix such problems 
there can be no assurance that we will not discover year compliance problems in our systems that will require substantial revision 
in addition  there can be no assurance that third party software  hardware or services incorporated into our material systems will not need to be revised or replaced  all of which could be time consuming and expensive 
our failure to fix or replace our internally developed proprietary software or third party software  hardware or services on a timely basis could result in lost revenues  increased operating costs  the loss of customers and other business interruptions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the failure to adequately address year compliance issues in our internally developed proprietary software could result in claims of mismanagement  misrepresentation or breach of contract and related litigation  which could be costly and time consuming to defend 
we are heavily dependent on a significant number of third party vendors to provide both network services and equipment 
a significant year related disruption of the network  services or equipment that third party vendors provide to us could cause our members and visitors to consider seeking alternate providers or cause an unmanageable burden on its technical support  which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that governmental agencies  utility companies  internet access companies  third party service providers and others outside of our control will be year compliant 
the failure by these entities to be year compliant could result in a systemic failure beyond our control  such as a prolonged internet  telecommunications or electrical failure  which could also prevent us from delivering our services to our customers  decrease the use of the internet or prevent users from accessing our web sites  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition we have a limited operating history and may face difficulties encountered in new and rapidly evolving markets we have a limited operating history and face many of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered in new and rapidly evolving markets  including the internet advertising market 
these risks include our ability to o attract a larger audience to our online network  o increase awareness of our brand  o strengthen user loyalty  o offer compelling content  o maintain our current  and develop new  strategic relationships  o attract a large number of advertisers from a variety of industries  o respond effectively to competitive pressures  o continue to develop and upgrade our technology  and o attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we lack significant revenues and have recent and anticipated continuing losses we have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we incurred net losses of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as of december  and december   our accumulated deficit was million and million  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and  as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
although our revenues have grown in recent quarters  we cannot guarantee that we will achieve sufficient revenues for profitability 
even if we do achieve profitability  we cannot guarantee that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
if revenues grow slower than we anticipate  or if operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
because our strategy includes acquisitions of other businesses  acquisition expenses and any cash used to make these acquisitions will reduce our available cash 
we use barter transactions which do not generate cash revenue revenues from barter transactions represented approximately and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
barter revenues may continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods 
barter transactions do not generate any cash revenues and are entered into by us to promote our brand and generate traffic to our web sites  without any expenditure of our cash resources 
we may not be able to integrate the operations from our recent and future acquisitions as part of our business strategy  we have completed and may enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions 
acquisition transactions are accompanied by a number of risks  including  among other things o the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  o the potential disruption of our ongoing business  o the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful incorporation of acquired technology or content and rights into our products and media properties  o expenses associated with the transactions  o additional expenses associated with amortization of acquired intangible assets  o the difficulty of maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  o the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel  and o the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses 
our failure to adequately address these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our acquisition of lamaze publishing poses a number of risks that could materially adversely affect our business strategy the acquisition of lamaze publishing is our first acquisition of a non internet company 
there are a number of risks in operating lamaze publishing  including o competitiveness of the media and publishing industry  o our inexperience in operating a multi media publishing company  o our ability to sell advertising and sponsorships on our web sites and in lamaze publishing s magazines  videos and the newborn channel  o our ability to commercialize and protect the lamaze mark  and o our ability to build and market lamaze 
com 
we have merchandising  inventory management and fulfillment responsibilities for ibaby we recently started handling merchandising  inventory management and order fulfillment for ibaby 
our failure to perform these functions efficiently and in a timely manner has and could result in the disruption of the operations of ibaby  including shipment delays 
in addition  changing trends in consumer tastes in baby related products subject us to inventory risks 
it is important to our success that we accurately identify and predict these trends and do not overstock unpopular products 
the demand for specific products can change between the time the products are ordered and the date of receipt 
if products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance  we may be required to take inventory markdowns  which could reduce our sales and gross margins 
we believe that this risk will increase as we open new departments or enter new product categories due to our lack of experience in purchasing products for these categories 
in addition  to the extent that demand for ibaby products increases over time  we may be forced to increase inventory levels 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are not indicative of future performance and are difficult to forecast as a result of our limited operating history  we do not have historical financial data for a significant number of periods upon which to forecast quarterly revenues and results of operations 
we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are necessarily meaningful nor should they be relied upon as reliable indicators of future performance 
in one or more future quarters  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if our results of operations fall below expectations  the trading price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
our revenues for the foreseeable future will remain dependent on user traffic levels and advertising activity on our web sites 
future revenues are difficult to forecast 
in addition  we plan to increase our sales and marketing operations and to expand and develop content 
we also plan to upgrade and enhance our technology and infrastructure development in order to support our growth 
we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
if we have a shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses  or if our expenses precede increased revenues  then our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
this would likely affect the market price of our common stock in a manner which may be unrelated to our long term operating performance 
seasonal and cyclical patterns may affect our business we believe that advertising sales in traditional media  such as television and radio  generally are lower in the first and third calendar quarters of each year 
if our market makes the transition from an emerging to a more developed market  seasonal and cyclical patterns may develop in the future 
as a result  if our industry follows the same seasonal patterns as those in traditional media  we may experience lower advertising revenues in the first and third calendar quarter of each year 
seasonal and cyclical patterns in internet advertising may also affect our revenues 
in addition  traffic levels on our web sites typically fluctuate during the summer and year end vacation and holiday periods and we anticipate that sales from ibaby  and any other future consumer goods we may sell  will typically increase during the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season and may decline during other periods 
the market for internet advertising is still developing we expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sponsorships and advertising for the foreseeable future  and demand and market acceptance for internet advertising solutions continues to develop 
there are currently no widely accepted standards for the measurement of the effectiveness of internet advertising  and the industry may need to develop standard measurements to support and promote internet advertising as a significant advertising medium 
if these standards do not develop  existing advertisers may not continue their levels of internet advertising 
furthermore  advertisers that have traditionally relied upon other advertising media may be reluctant to advertise on the internet 
our business would be adversely affected if the market for internet advertising fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected 
different pricing models are used to sell advertising on the internet and it is difficult to predict which  if any  of the models will emerge as the industry standard 
this makes it difficult to project our future advertising rates and revenues 
our advertising revenues could be adversely affected if we are unable to adapt to new forms of internet advertising 
moreover  software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to an internet user s computer are available 
widespread adoption of this software could adversely affect the commercial viability of internet advertising 
we rely on third parties to adequately measure the demographics of our user base and delivery of advertisements on our web sites it is important to our advertisers that we accurately measure the demographics of our user base and the delivery of advertisements on our web site 
we depend on third parties to provide many of these measurement services 
if they are unable to provide these services in the future  we would need to perform them ourselves or obtain them from another provider 
this could cause us to incur additional costs or cause interruptions in our business until we replace these services 
companies may choose to not advertise on our web sites or may pay less for advertising if they perceive our demographic measurements are not reliable 
we are currently experiencing a period of significant growth which is placing a significant strain on our resources if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our business could be adversely affected 
we have experienced and continue to experience significant growth  both internally and through acquisitions 
this growth has placed  and our anticipated future growth in our operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our resources 
as part of this growth  we will have to implement new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
we may not attract a sufficient amount of traffic and advertising without our channels being carried on aol aol has accounted for a significant portion of our online traffic based on the delivery to us of a guaranteed number of impressions 
a significant amount of our visitors and members reach our web sites through aol 
our agreement with aol does not prohibit aol from carrying online sites or developing and providing content that compete with our sites  and aol currently carries additional competing web sites 
our agreement with aol expires on december  and  even though either party may extend it for an additional year  aol does not have any obligation to renew the agreement 
if the carrying of our channels on aol is discontinued  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
we have a small number of customers and the loss of a number of these customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
consequently  the loss of even a small number of these customers at any one time may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although no advertiser accounted for more than of total revenues for the years ended december  or  our five largest advertisers accounted for and of total revenues  respectively 
at december   no one advertiser accounted for or more of net accounts receivable 
at december   one advertiser accounted for of net accounts receivable 
we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenues from a small number of customers 
in addition  we anticipate that these customers will continue to vary over time  so that the achievement of our long term goals will require us to obtain additional significant customers on an ongoing basis 
our failure to enter into a sufficient number of large contracts during a particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not find sufficient acquisition candidates to implement our business strategy as part of our business strategy  we have completed and expect to enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions 
we compete for acquisition candidates with other entities  some of which have greater financial resources than we have 
increased competition for acquisition candidates may make fewer acquisition opportunities available to us and may cause acquisitions to be made on less attractive terms  such as higher purchase prices 
acquisition costs may increase to levels that are beyond our financial capability or that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to make acquisitions will depend in part on the relative attractiveness of shares of our common stock as consideration for potential acquisition candidates 
this attractiveness may depend largely on the relative market price  our ability to register common stock and capital appreciation prospects of our common stock compared to that of other bidders 
if the market price of our common stock were to decline materially over a prolonged period of time  our acquisition program could be materially adversely affected 
we may be sued for information retrieved from our web sites we have been and may be subject to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury or other legal theories relating to the information we publish on our web sites 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against online services as well as other print publications in the past 
we could also be subjected to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our web sites through links to other web sites or through content and materials that may be posted by members in chat rooms or bulletin boards 
we also offer e mail services  which may subject us to potential risks  such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited e mail  lost or misdirected messages  illegal or fraudulent use of e mail or interruptions or delays in e mail service 
our insurance  which covers commercial general liability  may not adequately protect us against these types of claims 
we may incur potential product liability for the products we sell consumers may sue us if any of the products that we sell are defective  fail to perform properly or injure the user 
to date  we have had very limited experience in the sale of products and the development of relationships with manufacturers or suppliers of such products 
we plan to develop a range of products targeted specifically at women through our ibaby  imaternity and plusboutique sites  astrology 
com  lamaze publishing and other e commerce sites that we may acquire in the future 
we also may foster relationships with manufacturers or companies to offer these products directly on ivillage 
com 
such a strategy involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
although our agreements with manufacturers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims  these limitations may not prevent all potential claims 
in addition  through lamaze publishing  we distribute publications and broadcast over the newborn channel information and instructions regarding childbirth and infant care 
we may be exposed to liability claims in connection with the information we provide 
liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation and to pay significant damages 
as a result  these claims  whether or not successful  could seriously damage our reputation and our business 
there is intense competition among internet based businesses and publishing companies focused on women the number of web sites competing for the attention and spending of members  users and advertisers has increased and we expect it to continue to increase 
our web sites compete for members  users and advertisers with the following types of companies o online services or web sites targeted at women  such as women 
com networks  o cable networks targeting women  such as oxygen media  inc o web search and retrieval and other online service companies  commonly referred to as portals  such as disney s go network  lycos  inc and yahoo inc  o e commerce companies such as etoys  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  babycenter  inc  and o publishers and distributors of traditional media  such as television  radio and print 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
lamaze publishing s magazines directly compete with publishers of pre and post natal publications such as gruner and jahr  primedia and time warner 
these publishers have substantially greater marketing  research and financial resources than lamaze publishing 
increased competition may result in less advertising in lamaze publishing s magazines and a decline in lamaze publishing s advertising rates  which could adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
our uncertain sales cycles could adversely affect our business the time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor is often lengthy  typically ranging from six weeks for smaller agreements to nine months for larger agreements  and is subject to delays over which we have little or no control  including o advertisers and sponsors budgetary constraints  o advertisers and sponsors internal acceptance reviews  o the success and continued internal support of advertisers and sponsors own development efforts  and o the possibility of cancellation or delay of projects by advertisers or sponsors 
during the sales cycle  we may expend substantial funds and management resources and yet not obtain sponsorship or advertising revenues 
accordingly  our results of operations for a particular period may be adversely affected if sales to advertisers or sponsors forecasted in a particular period are delayed or do not otherwise occur 
aol investments may result in conflicts of interest for aol that could be adverse to ivillage aol has invested in oxygen media  an internet and television company that is developing cable and interactive content for women and children 
in addition  oxygen media has acquired from aol the assets of electra 
com  an online women s network  and thrive partners llc  the operator of thriveonline 
com  a health site 
the relationship between aol and oxygen media and aol and other internet companies may result in a conflict of interest for aol  which may not be resolved in our favor 
in addition  other principal investors in ivillage may have similar conflicts of interests by virtue of their other investments 
our business is dependent on our chief executive officer and editor in chief our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel  particularly  candice carpenter  chief executive officer  and nancy evans  editor in chief 
we have no employment agreements with either of these executives and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our personnel  other than ms 
carpenter 
the loss of the services of mdmes 
carpenter or evans  or other key employees  would likely have a significantly detrimental effect on our business 
competition for personnel in the internet industry is intense we may be unable to retain our key employees or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
we have from time to time experienced  and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications as a result of our rapid growth and expansion 
in addition  there is significant competition for qualified employees in the internet industry 
as a result  we incurred increased salaries  benefits and recruiting expenses during and if we do not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating our current personnel  our business will be adversely affected 
we are dependent on continued growth in use of the internet our market is new and rapidly evolving 
our business would be adversely affected if internet usage does not continue to grow  particularly usage by women 
a number of factors may inhibit internet usage  including o inadequate network infrastructure  o security concerns  o inconsistent quality of service  o lack of availability of cost effective  high speed service  o consumers returning to traditional or alternative sources for information  shopping and services  and o privacy concerns  including those related to the ability of web sites to gather information about users without their knowledge or consent 
if internet usage continues to grow significantly  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline 
in addition  web sites have experienced interruptions in their services as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure 
if these outages and delays frequently occur in the future  internet usage  as well as the usage of our web sites  could grow more slowly or decline 
we may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change in our industry our market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
the recent growth of the internet and intense competition in our industry exacerbate these market characteristics 
to achieve our goals  we need to effectively integrate the various software programs and tools required to enhance and improve our product offerings and manage our business 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance features and reliability of our services 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new products and services 
in addition  our new enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective users and must achieve significant market acceptance 
we could also incur substantial costs if we need to modify our services or infrastructures to adapt to these changes 
government regulation and legal uncertainties could add additional costs to doing business on the internet there are currently few laws or regulations that specifically regulate communications or commerce on the internet 
however  laws and regulations may be adopted in the future that address issues such as user privacy  pricing and taxation  content  copyrights  distribution  antitrust matters and the characteristics and quality of products and services 
for example  the telecommunications act sought to prohibit transmitting various types of information and content over the internet 
several telecommunications companies have petitioned the federal communications commission to regulate internet service providers and online service providers in a manner similar to long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on those companies 
this could increase the cost of transmitting data over the internet 
moreover  it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as property ownership  obscenity  libel and personal privacy are applicable to the internet or the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business 
any new laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect our business 
in addition  it has been reported that the labor department is investigating the use of volunteers on web sites 
we utilize volunteers as web site community leaders and there can be no assurance that new government regulations will not require us to cease using volunteers or  alternatively  treat them as employees 
due to the global nature of the internet  it is possible that  although our transmissions over the internet originate primarily in new york  the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate our business activities 
in addition  because our service is available over the internet in multiple states and foreign countries  these jurisdictions may require us to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each of these states or foreign countries  which could subject us to taxes and other regulations 
we may face potential liability for our privacy practices growing public concern about privacy and the collection  distribution and use of information about individuals may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and or litigation 
if we are accused of violating the stated terms of our privacy policy we may be forced to expend significant amounts of monetary and human resources to defend against any such accusations 
we may also be required to make changes to our present and planned products or services 
these consequences together with any resulting liability for our privacy practices could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our systems may fail or experience a slow down and our users depend on others for access to our web sites substantially all of our communications hardware and some of our other computer hardware operations are located at exodus communications  inc s facilities in jersey city  new jersey and verio  inc s and at t cerfnet s facilities in california 
fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events could damage these systems 
computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptive problems  such as those recently experienced by several leading web sites  could also adversely affect our web sites 
our business could be adversely affected if our systems were affected by any of these occurrences 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in our systems 
we do not presently have any secondary off site systems or a formal disaster recovery plan 
our web sites must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information 
our web sites have in the past experienced slower response times or decreased traffic for a variety of reasons 
these occurrences have not had a material impact on our business 
these types of occurrences in the future could cause users to perceive our web sites as not functioning properly and therefore cause them to use another web site or other methods to obtain information 
in addition  our users depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to our web sites 
many of them have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
we may not be able to deliver various services if third parties fail to provide reliable software  systems and related services to us we are dependent on various third parties for software  systems and related services 
for example  we rely on doubleclick inc s software for the placement of advertisements and whowhere inc for personal space home pages and e mail 
several of the third parties which provide software and services to us have a limited operating history  have relatively immature technology and are themselves dependent on reliable delivery of services from others 
as a result  our ability to deliver various services to our users may be adversely affected by the failure of these third parties to provide reliable software  systems and related services to us 
we may be liable if third parties misappropriate our users personal information if third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate our users personal information or credit card information  we could be subject to liability arising from claims related to  among other things  unauthorized purchases with credit card information  impersonation or other similar fraud claims or other misuse of personal information  such as for unauthorized marketing purposes 
in addition  the federal trade commission and state agencies have been investigating various internet companies regarding their use of personal information 
we could incur additional expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if our privacy practices are investigated 
internet security concerns could hinder e commerce the need to securely transmit confidential information over the internet has been a significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications over the internet 
any well publicized compromise of security could deter people from using the internet or using it to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information 
we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
satellite transmissions over the newborn channel may be interrupted through lamaze publishing  we operate the newborn channel  a satellite television network broadcast in over hospitals in the united states 
there is a risk that the satellite from which the transmission is sent may malfunction  interrupting lamaze publishing s broadcasts 
in the event this occurs  there may be a period of time before lamaze publishing can transmit to and from another satellite 
any interruption in lamaze publishing s ability to transmit the newborn channel could have an adverse impact on its business 
in addition  extreme adverse weather could damage receivers and transmitters on the ground  thereby hindering transmissions 
consumer protection privacy regulations could impair our ability to obtain information about our users our network captures information regarding our members in order to tailor content to them and assist advertisers in targeting their advertising campaigns to particular demographic groups 
however  privacy concerns may cause users to resist providing the personal data necessary to support this tailoring capability 
even the perception of security and privacy concerns  whether or not valid  may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our network 
in addition  legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten these concerns if businesses must notify internet users that the data may be used by marketing entities to direct product promotion and advertising to the user 
other countries and political entities  such as the european economic community  have adopted such legislation or regulatory requirements 
if consumer privacy concerns are not adequately addressed  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 
our network currently uses cookies to track demographic information and user preferences 
a cookie is information keyed to a specific server  file pathway or directory location that is stored on a user s hard drive  possibly without the user s knowledge  but is generally removable by the user 
germany has imposed laws limiting the use of cookies  and a number of internet commentators  advocates and governmental bodies in the united states and other countries have urged the passage of laws limiting or abolishing the use of cookies 
if these laws are passed  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 
possible infringement of intellectual property rights could harm our business we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights 
any infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results 
in addition  we have from time to time become involved in intellectual property disputes with third parties which may not result in a favorable outcome for us 
we could be subject to possible infringement actions based upon our use of domain names  our content and content licensed from others we have invested resources in acquiring domain names for existing and potential future use 
we cannot guarantee that we will be entitled to use such names under applicable trademark and similar laws or that other desired domain names will be available 
furthermore  enforcing our intellectual property rights could entail significant expense and could prove difficult or impossible 
in addition  third parties could assert claims of patent  trademark or copyright infringement or misappropriation of creative ideas or formats against us with respect to our use of domain names  our content  web page formats  web business methods or any third party content carried by us 
we expect that participants in our markets increasingly will be subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in our industry segment grows 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management attention  require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements or prevent us from using important technologies  ideas or formats  any of which could materially harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
several members of senior management have only recently joined ivillage several members of our senior management joined us in and and have not previously worked together 
as a result  our senior managers are continuing to become integrated as a management team and may not work together effectively as a team to successfully manage our growth
