company background we were founded in and completed an initial public offering of common stock in in the mid s  we were a leading technology innovator in the hard disk drive industry 
as is true today  the hard disk drive industry during the s was intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change  rapid rates of product and technology obsolescence  changing customer requirements  dramatic shifts in market share and significant erosion of average selling prices 
in an effort to mitigate the risks associated with these factors  we pursued all major product segments in the hard disk drive market  utilizing multiple product families and technology platforms 
this costly strategy added significant complexity to the business  which caused us to delay or miss a number of key product introductions and ultimately led to the deterioration of our overall financial condition 
as a result of this deterioration  we sold of our outstanding common stock to hyundai electronics industries and its affiliates in in early  hyundai electronics america hea acquired all of the remaining publicly held shares of our common stock as well as all of our common stock then held by hyundai electronics industries and its affiliates 
shortly thereafter  hea invested in renewed efforts to revitalize maxtor 
in july  we hired michael r 
cannon  our current chief executive officer and president and a year veteran of the hard drive industry  who had previously served in senior management positions in ibm s systems storage division and at syquest technology and control data corporation 
with a view toward capturing business at leading desktop computer manufacturers  mr 
cannon identified four key areas requiring improvement corporate leadership 
to provide strong leadership and the required focus on execution  we recruited seasoned  industry veterans for key senior management positions 
in addition to mr 
cannon  key management positions added includes paul j 
tufano  our senior vice president  finance  and chief financial officer  whose previous experience includes more than years in a variety of management positions at ibm  and kh teh  our vice president  worldwide manufacturing  whose previous experience includes years in a variety of manufacturing management positions at iomega  quantum and syquest 
these senior managers joined dr 
victor b 
jipson  our president  network systems group  who has been at maxtor since december and was then our senior vice president  engineering  whose previous experience includes years with ibm in a variety of research  technical strategy  product strategy  research and development  and general management positions 
in addition  we added personnel with significant industry experience to our engineering  manufacturing  procurement  human resources  and sales and marketing organizations 
cost competitiveness 
since  we aggressively moved to reduce our cost structure 
we stopped using a hard disk drive manufacturing facility owned and operated by hyundai electronics industries in korea and consolidated our volume hard disk drive manufacturing facilities in singapore 
we also closed our sub assembly manufacturing facility in thailand and sold our majority interest in international manufacturing services  our former printed circuit board division  to certain members of international manufacturing services management and institutional investors 
these actions helped reduce our workforce by approximately by october of we also removed layers of management and implemented strict discretionary expense controls 
in addition  we improved the productivity of our research and development expenditures by simplifying our technology and product roadmap to focus on desktop computer hard disk drives using a single core technology platform 
timely introduction of new products 
our new management team took a number of steps designed to improve time to market introduction  time to volume production  quality  performance and manufacturability of our products  and the effectiveness and efficiency of our research and development expenditures 
in particular  we simplified our product and technology roadmap by canceling our inch and inch programs  focused our research and development efforts on a single core technology platform that included magneto resistive head technology and a digital signal processor based electronic architecture  which we believe are capable of supporting rapid extension of our product and technology roadmap  and restructured our product development process by creating an advanced technology group  which is responsible for assessing new technology viability  developing early prototypes and exploiting common design architectures  and by strengthening our existing product design teams  which are responsible for taking the building blocks provided by the advanced technology group and designing high performance  highly manufacturable  cost effective products which meet our customer specifications 
customer channel mix 
recognizing that the vast majority of the growth in the desktop computer market was being captured by a limited number of leading personal computer manufacturers  our new management simplified our sales channels and focused our sales and marketing resources on establishing maxtor as a preferred supplier to leading desktop computer manufacturers and a limited number of leading distributors and retailers 
to improve overall customer satisfaction and capture accounts with leading desktop computer manufacturers  we initiated a number of actions to improve product quality and created dedicated account support teams for our major desktop computer manufacturer clients  emphasizing senior management involvement in developing and maintaining customer relationships 
turnaround results as a result of the changes described above  our performance improved significantly during a period of severe fluctuations in the overall hard disk drive market 
timely introduction of new products 
our restructured manufacturing and product development processes  as well as a simplified product and technology roadmap  enabled us to complete one of the fastest transitions in the industry from hard disk drives utilizing thin film head technology to use of magneto resistive head technology by the end of with our diamondmax  and products  we demonstrated significantly improved time to volume manufacturing in the fourth quarter of  second quarter of and the third quarter of by producing  and million units of these products  respectively  during their first full quarters of production 
in the first quarter of  we established ourselves as a time to market entry leader with our gigabytes per disk hard drive  the diamondmax in the second quarter of  we continued our trend of being a time to market leader with a gigabyte hard disk drive  the diamondmax  and the diamondmax plus  our first rpm product 
our time to market leadership continued in the fourth quarter of with the introduction of our gigabyte per disk hard disk drive  the diamondmax  and in the first quarter of with our diamondmax plus  our second generation rpm drive 
these improvements  in turn  enabled us to increase our units shipped per quarter from million units during the first quarter of to million units in the fourth quarter of customer channel mix 
our new focus on leading desktop computer manufacturers led to significant improvements in our customer channel mix 
for example  our revenue from shipments to compaq  dell and ibm has increased from approximately of total revenue in the second quarter of to of our total revenue in the fourth quarter of we also became a leading supplier of desktop hard disk drives to dell in less than six months and were a leading provider of desktop hard disk drives shipped to the domestic retail channel during these cumulative changes have resulted in improved financial results 
we increased revenues by and  from  million in to  million and  million in and  respectively  with improvements in gross margin from to and for the same periods 
cost competitiveness 
our cost competitiveness initiatives led to significant reduction of operating expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was among the lowest in the industry for our and fiscal years 
industry background the desktop hard disk drive market 
according to international data corporation idc  the desktop computer segment is the largest segment of the worldwide personal computer market  accounting for approximately of global personal computer shipments in as a result  desktop computers were the leading source of demand for hard disk drives  accounting for more than of all hard disk drive units shipped worldwide in  according to idc 
the demand for desktop computers and  therefore  computer hard disk drives  continues to grow in part due to continued improvements in desktop computing price to performance ratios  including the emergence of the sub  desktop computer  the rapid accumulation of data resulting from the digitization of information previously stored in paper form  larger file sizes created by multimedia intensive applications  the exchange of increasing volumes of data among users across the internet and intranets with the proliferation of collaborative computing  and increased demand for desktop computer upgrades as a result of year compliance efforts 
future demand growth for hard disk drives also may be driven by new and emerging hard disk drive markets 
in october  idc forecast that the worldwide desktop computer segment of the hard disk drive market would grow from approximately million units in to million units in  reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
hard disk drive technology 
the basic operation of a hard disk drive has not changed materially since its introduction in the s 
to improve the performance of hard disk drives  hard disk drive manufacturers have concentrated their efforts on optimizing the performance of the various components of the hard disk drive 
the main components of the hard disk drive are the hard disk assembly and the printed circuit board 
the head disk assembly includes the head  media disks  head positioning mechanism actuator and spin motor 
these components are contained in a hard base plate protective package in a contamination free environment 
the printed circuit board includes custom integrated circuits  an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector 
the head disk assembly is comprised of one or more disks positioned around a spindle hub that rotates the disks by a spin motor 
disks are made of a smooth substrate to which a thin coating of magnetic materials is applied 
each disk has a head suspended directly above it  which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk 
the sensor element of the head  also known as the slider  is getting progressively smaller  resulting in reduced material costs 
the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a drive interface and a controller 
the drive interface receives instructions from the computer  while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks  and controls the heads 
the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in tracks  divided into sectors 
the computer sends instructions to read or write data to the disks based on track and sector locations 
industry standard interfaces are utilized to allow the disk drive to communicate with the computer 
a key performance metric in the hard disk drive industry is areal density  which is the measure of stored bits per square inch on the recording surface of a disk 
an increase in areal density allows a hard disk drive provider to decrease the price per megabyte stored by increasing overall storage capacity per disk  thus reducing product costs through reduced component requirements 
during and  certain hard disk drive providers began transitioning to magneto resistive heads 
prior to this transition  most hard disk drives utilized thin film inductive recording heads 
magneto resistive heads have discrete read and write structures which provide more signal than the older thin film inductive heads 
this results in significantly higher areal densities  which increases storage capacity per disk and improves manufacturing margin and product reliability 
hard disk drive providers are evaluating or implementing a number of technological innovations designed to further increase hard disk drive performance and reduce product costs  including attempting to simplify the electronic architecture by combining the traditional servo control functions of the digital signal processor based electronic architecture and the error recovery and interface management functions of traditional hard drive microprocessors on a single integrated circuit 
moreover  to consistently achieve timely introduction and rapid volume production of new products  some hard disk drive providers are striving to simplify their product design processes by focusing on creating extendible core technology platforms which utilize common firmware and mechanical designs and re use of manufacturing tooling and application specific integrated circuits across various product generations and product lines 
hard disk drive market challenges 
personal computer manufacturers compete in a consolidating market 
the top ten personal computer manufacturers accounted for greater than of all personal computer units shipped during and these personal computer manufacturers use the quality  storage capacity and performance characteristics of hard drives to select their hard disk drive providers 
personal computer manufacturers typically seek to qualify three or four providers for a given hard disk drive product generation 
to qualify consistently with personal computer manufacturers and thus succeed in the desktop hard drive industry  a hard disk drive provider must consistently execute on its product development and manufacturing process in order to be among the first to market introduction and first to volume production at leading storage capacity per disk with competitive prices 
failure to reach the market on time or to deliver timely volume production usually results in significantly decreased gross margins due to rapidly declining average selling prices and dramatic losses in market share 
successful achievement of the performance parameters  however  is only part of the competitive equation 
as personal computer manufacturers seek to develop successful business models  they are also requiring their hard disk drive vendors to maintain high levels of quality to enable low cost of ownership and adapt their inventory management models to be compatible with the emerging build to order business model in the personal computer industry 
our solution we have established ourselves as a leading provider of high quality  high performance hard disk drives to major desktop computer manufacturers  distributors and retailers 
our management team has extensive hard disk drive industry experience across all functional areas 
as a result  we have been able to define and implement the key business processes necessary to fulfill the needs of our customers 
these processes focus on the efficient  timely and cost effective integration of leading edge technology to create highly manufacturable hard disk drives 
moreover  our senior management team vigorously monitors these processes in an effort to ensure consistent execution and prompt response to customer demands 
we intend to strengthen our leadership position in the desktop hard disk drive industry by consistently executing these fundamental business processes 
our strategy we seek to be the dominant provider of hard disk drives to leading desktop computer manufacturers  distributors and retailers 
since the fourth quarter of  we have been broadening our business to the nas market 
our strategy to achieve this goal includes the following elements effectively integrate new technology 
in  we overhauled our research and development process by augmenting our traditional product development teams with a new advanced technology group 
the advanced technology group s purpose is to monitor and evaluate advancements in hard disk drive technology for possible integration into our future products 
this group also works closely with our product development teams and strategic component vendors to obtain early access to the latest hard disk drive component technology  allow for flexibility in choosing state of the art components  and ensure viability of new product technologies and components prior to product design 
through this process  we intend to continue to integrate new technologies into our existing core technology platform and to strengthen our ability to introduce high quality  highly manufacturable  high performance hard disk drive products with industry leading time to volume production on a consistent basis 
leverage design excellence 
our product development methodology reduces risks associated with design changes by focusing on common firmware and mechanical designs  and re use of manufacturing tooling and application specific integrated circuits 
through this process  we have created a technology platform  which is used as the common core of each of our current hard disk drive products and which we believe is extendible into products for new and emerging hard disk drive market opportunities 
to reduce the overall cost of ownership of our hard disk drive products  we use a robust mechanical architecture designed to reduce defects that result from customer mishandling during installation 
we also work closely with leading component suppliers in an effort to ensure that adequate tolerances are designed into our products to achieve high manufacturing yields and product quality 
by utilizing this product development methodology  we have successfully introduced and achieved timely volume production of seven generations of magneto resistive head hard disk drives in less than two years 
capitalize on flexible manufacturing 
our singapore manufacturing facility utilizes a flexible cell based process that enables us to dedicate manufacturing cells to particular customers  thereby allowing us to identify  isolate and remedy manufacturing defects quickly  resulting in improved product quality  faster time to volume production and improved overall customer satisfaction  simultaneously manufacture multiple product configurations  quickly reconfigure the facility to respond to customer change requests and changes in product and customer mix  effectively adapt our inventory management model to the emerging build to order business model employed by certain of our desktop computer manufacturer customers  and add incremental capacity as needed at a relatively low cost 
this flexible cell based process  when coupled with our product design methodology  has enabled us to significantly improve time to volume production 
for example  we manufactured million units of our diamondmax in the third quarter of  the first full quarter of production 
increase market share with leading desktop computer manufacturers 
we intend to continue to achieve leading time to volume production of high quality  high performance hard disk drives to capture additional market share with leading personal computer manufacturers 
our quarterly market share of the desktop hard disk drive market in terms of units shipped increased from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of  according to idc 
maintain customer satisfaction 
we believe we distinguish ourselves from our competitors by focusing on ease of doing business and overall customer satisfaction 
for example  our no quibble service program has been well received by our customers 
we also are devoting significant attention to total supply chain management to align our business model with the evolving build to order manufacturing business model of certain desktop computer manufacturers 
we use our flexible  cell based manufacturing process coupled with a just in time inventory model to rapidly respond to the changing needs of our key desktop computer manufacturer customers 
to further automate and improve the efficiency of our total supply chain management  we have recently installed a new enterprise resource planning system 
broaden product portfolio 
to capture higher margin opportunities  we intend to leverage our existing technology platform and product development methodology to develop hard disk drive products to meet the needs of desktop computers  storage subsystems  consumer electronics  and other emerging storage applications 
to this end  we currently offer products with two rotational speeds and rpm with configurations from through disks 
this results in a product portfolio with the broadest range of performance and capacity in the industry and allows us to target entry  mid range  and high end applications in all of the above markets 
the and platter designs have been particularly beneficial to our profit margins and our strategic position as competitors have suspended their development and introduction of these high capacity products 
additionally  on january  maxtor announced the maxattach desktop line of server appliances with enhanced software features that include disk mirroring and disk spanning at storage capacities of  and gb 
these products are designed to enable quick  easy  safe and cost effective addition of storage to networks in workgroups and small businesses 
the new maxattach nas line of rack mount server appliances broadens client support to include unix and linux in addition to microsoft  and is slated for volume availability in the second quarter of to address the expanding storage needs of larger work groups  internet service providers and departmental market segments  maxtor has announced its intention to introduce additional solutions in its extended family of maxattach storage solutions during the first half of these will include application specific appliances as well as capacity increases to gb 
product development technology one of the most important changes undertaken as part of our turnaround was the restructuring of our product development process to separate the enabling technology development phase from the product design phase 
in early  we suffered from poor product quality and performance  and products that were late to market 
this contrasts sharply with today as we now enjoy strong customer relationships based on excellent product quality  time to volume production leadership and industry leading performance 
enabling technology development phase 
the advanced technology group is responsible for the enabling technology development phase  including working closely with our product design teams and strategic component suppliers to create a variety of state of the art technologies to be used in our future products  developing early prototypes to ascertain the stability and manufacturability of our planned products  and analyzing the latest head  disk  channel  motor and application specific integrated circuit technologies and designs to broaden and strengthen our technology platform 
this group also focuses on leveraging our current proven technology platform by re using as much electronic and mechanical technology as possible in each successive product generation 
in an effort to deliver the highest product quality possible  the advanced technology group begins its review of emerging technologies as early as possible  normally months before such technologies might be included in our products 
product design phase 
the creation of the advanced technology group as part of our turnaround freed our existing product design group from the responsibility of assessing the viability of new and emerging technologies and allowed it to concentrate on improving product performance  robustness  manufacturability  quality and materials costs 
the product design group also is responsible  in part  for executing our new product introduction process 
this process is a highly disciplined review procedure designed to ensure that new product designs meet clearly specified criteria in terms of yield  scrap  quality  productivity and production ramp rates prior to release into volume production 
products we currently provide hard disk drives primarily for the desktop computer market  with applications beginning to emerge in consumer electronics  network attached storage supporting mnsg  and storage subsystems 
our diamondmax product family consists of inch hard disk drives with storage capacities ranging from to gigabytes 
our latest products  announced march   are the diamondmax vl and diamondmax  both rpm products 
the diamondmax vl provides capacity of gigabytes up to gigabytes and provides cost optimized storage for the entry and mainstream segments of the market

com usa winlist for diamondmax plus october manufacturing quality to be competitive  we must manufacture high quality  highly manufacturable  high performance hard disk drives with industry leading time to volume production at competitive costs 
our hard disk drive manufacturing operations consist primarily of the final assembly of high level subassemblies built to our specifications and testing of completed products 
manufacturing 
pilot production of our products  as well as cost reduction  quality and product improvement engineering on current products  are conducted at our longmont  colorado facility 
we manufacture our hard disk drives in volume at multiple facilities in singapore  which uses a flexible  cell based process 
the singapore facility consists of modular production units mpus  each of which contains a number of modular work cells mwcs 
each mwc essentially is a mini serial production line consisting of all of the tooling and test equipment necessary to build and test a hard disk drive 
each mpu is responsible for managing the supply of the components and other parts required by its mwcs 
we coupled our cell based manufacturing approach with a sophisticated factory information system that collects data from each mwc on various productivity and quality metrics 
in march  we purchased two buildings in singapore totaling approximately  square meters and entered into a long term lease of the underlying land from singapore s housing development board 
the property is located near our current volume manufacturing facilities 
pursuant to a sublease accompanying the option  we have taken possession of this facility and have begun volume manufacturing and warehousing operations there 
we believe that we will be able to add capacity at our current facility or another facility to provide sufficient capacity through at least the end of quality 
consistent with our goal to establish maxtor as a leader in product quality and overall customer satisfaction  we have implemented a corporate wide quality program  which focuses on robustness of design and improved design tolerances  quality of incoming parts and factory process control  and customer feedback  failure analysis and timely response 
in addition  our quality  materials  enabling technology and product development groups work closely with leading component vendors in an effort to ensure sufficient tolerances are designed into our hard disk drives to achieve high manufacturing yields and product quality 
our singapore facility also is iso certified 
finally  our executives meet regularly with customers to exchange product quality information to facilitate rapid analysis of customer failures and timely implementation of corrective actions 
materials and supplies we have developed and continue to develop strategic relationships with leading suppliers of many of the key components for our hard disk drive products 
these relationships enable us to actively manage our supply chain to improve flexibility in choosing state of the art components and to reduce component  inventory and overall product costs 
in addition  our strategic suppliers work closely with our advanced technology group  enabling us to gain early access to leading edge hard disk drive technology and to improve the overall efficiency of our product design process 
we rely on a limited number of leading suppliers for the parts used in the manufacturing of our products  including magneto resistive heads and head stack assemblies  media  custom integrated circuits  read channel integrated circuits  printed circuit boards and motor baseplate assemblies 
in general  we seek to have at least two or three suppliers for each of our component requirements 
custom application specific integrated circuits  including our digital signal processor controller chips  and channels  however  currently are sole sourced from texas instruments and lucent  respectively 
because of their custom nature  these products require significant design in periods and long lead times 
we outsource a majority of our printed circuit board assembly to celestica  inc  a successor to our former affiliate  international manufacturing services  inc customers and sales channels from to  chronic performance and quality issues  as well as late to market product introduction  had impacted adversely our ability to win business with leading desktop computer manufacturers 
as a result  we were heavily dependent on sales to a large number of regional distributors which limited our ability to forecast periodic shipments and shifted our product mix toward lower performance  lower margin products 
recognizing that the majority of the growth in shipments in the desktop computer market was being captured by a limited number of desktop computer manufacturers  we simplified our sales channels and focused our sales and marketing efforts on becoming a significant provider of hard disk drives to leading desktop computer manufacturers  including compaq  dell  gateway  inc  hewlett packard and ibm  and a limited number of leading distributors and retailers 
by emphasizing overall customer satisfaction  product quality and performance and time to volume production  we believe that we have established a strong customer base 
manufacturers 
shipments to our three primary desktop computer manufacturer customers accounted for of our total revenue in the quarter ended june  and increased to in the quarter ended january  including the above  we shipped to nine of the top ten desktop computer manufacturers in we believe that our success depends on our ability to maintain and further develop strong desktop computer manufacturer customer relationships and to provide products that fit the needs of the desktop computer manufacturer channel 
distributors 
we use a select group of distributors to sell our products cost effectively to the large number of geographically dispersed customers which tend to hold very small market shares of the overall desktop computer market  including value added resellers  dealers  system integrators and small desktop computer manufacturers 
distributors accounted for of revenue for the year ended december   of revenue for the year ended december   and of revenue for the year ended january  distributors generally enter into non exclusive agreements with us for purchase and redistribution of product on a quick turnover basis 
purchase orders are placed and revised on a weekly basis 
we grant certain of our distributors price protection and limited rights to return product on a rotation basis 
our major distributors include bell micro and ingram 
retailers 
to increase awareness of the maxtor brand name and benefit from the typically higher gross margins of the retail sales channel  we sell our retail packaged products directly to major retailers such as computer superstores  warehouse clubs and computer electronics stores  and authorized sales through distributors to smaller retailers 
retailers accounted for of revenue for the year ended december   of revenue for the year ended december   and of revenue for the year ended january  our current retail customer base is in the united states and canada  however  we have begun efforts to establish a retail channel presence in the emerging retail markets in europe and asia 
we believe the retail channel complements other sales channels 
retailers supply the after market upgrade sector in which end users purchase and install products to upgrade their computers 
we grant certain of our retailers price protection and limited rights to return product on a rotation basis 
sales and marketing we market and sell our products to leading desktop computer manufacturers  distributors and retailers 
representative offices are located throughout the united states and in australia  france  germany  great britain  hong kong  japan  korea  singapore and taiwan 
we have formed multi disciplined  dedicated account and channel teams focused on each of its current and target strategic desktop computer manufacturer  distributor and retail accounts 
these teams generally are comprised of representatives from our sales  marketing  engineering and quality organizations 
our senior management also takes an active role in our sales efforts 
dedicated field sales and technical support personnel are located in close proximity to the manufacturing facilities of each of our desktop computer manufacturer customers 
our marketing and public relations functions are performed both internally and through outside firms 
public relations  direct marketing  worldwide packaging and marketing materials are targeted to various end user segments 
we utilize both consumer media and trade publications 
we have programs under which qualifying resellers are reimbursed for certain advertising expenditures 
we also have invested in direct marketing and customer satisfaction programs 
we maintain ongoing contact with end users through primary and secondary market research  focus groups  product registrations and technical support databases 
backlog we generally sell standard products according to standard agreements or purchase order terms 
delivery dates are specified by purchase orders 
such orders may be subject to change  cancellation or rescheduling by the customer without significant penalties 
the quantity actually purchased and shipment schedules are frequently revised to reflect changes in the customer s needs 
in addition  orders for our products are filled for several large customers from just in time inventory warehouses  whereby orders are not placed ahead of time on our order entry backlog system 
instead  we receive a periodic forecast of requirements from the customer 
upon shipment from the just in time warehouse  the customer is invoiced 
in light of these factors  backlog reporting as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual revenue for any succeeding period and  therefore  is not necessarily an accurate predictor of our future revenue 
competition we compete primarily with manufacturers of inch hard disk drives  including fujitsu  quantum  samsung  seagate  ibm  and western digital  some of which have a larger share of the desktop hard disk drive market than ours 
we believe that important competitive factors in the hard disk drive market are quality  storage capacity  performance  price  time to market introduction  time to volume production  desktop computer manufacturer product qualifications  breadth of product lines  reliability and technical service and support 
we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors 
see section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors affecting future performance the hard disk drive market is highly competitive

item legal proceedings we are currently involved in a dispute with stormedia incorporated stormedia  which arose out of an agreement among maxtor  stormedia and hyundai electronics industries co 
ltd 
hei which became effective on november  in that agreement  stormedia agreed to supply disk media to the maxtor 
stormedia s disk media did not meet our specifications and functional requirements as required by the agreement and we ultimately terminated the agreement 
after a class action securities lawsuit was filed against stormedia by certain of its shareholders in september which alleged  in part  that stormedia failed to perform under the agreement  stormedia sued hei  mong hun chung hei s chairman  dr 
chong sup park hyundai electronics america hea s president and the individual who signed the stormedia agreement on behalf of maxtor and ks yoo the individual who signed the stormedia agreement on behalf of hei collectively the original defendants in federal court the federal suit 
in the federal suit  stormedia alleged that at the time hei entered into the stormedia agreement  it knew that it would not and could not purchase the volume of products it committed to purchase  and that failure to do so caused damages to stormedia in excess of million 
in december  we filed a complaint against stormedia and william almon stormedia s chairman and chief executive officer in a colorado state court seeking approximately million in damages and alleging  among other claims  breach of contract  breach of implied warranty of fitness and fraud under the stormedia agreement the colorado suit 
this proceeding was stayed pending resolution of the federal suit 
the federal suit was permanently dismissed early in february on february   stormedia filed a new complaint in a california state court for million  alleging fraud and deceit against the original defendants and negligent misrepresentation against hei and maxtor the california suit 
on may   the stay on the colorado suit was lifted by the colorado state court 
our motion to dismiss  or in the alternative  stay the california suit  is pending 
on september   the california suit was stayed pending resolution of the colorado suit 
on october   stormedia filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy act 
this bankruptcy filing caused an automatic stay of proceedings against stormedia  including the colorado suit 
stormedia has not prosecuted its claims against maxtor since it filed for bankruptcy protection 
on or about february   we filed proofs of claim in the bankruptcy cases against stormedia  inc and stormedia international  ltd  in which we asserted claims based upon the claims and allegations set forth in the colorado action 
on or about november   stormedia filed an objection to proof of claim and counterclaims and crossclaims for breach of contract  breach of the implied covenant of good faith  and fair dealing  promissory fraud  and fraud and deceit  titled stormedia  inc and stormedia int l ltd 
v 
maxtor corp 
and hyundai electronics indus  inc in re stormedia  inc  commencing adversary proceeding number the bankruptcy action 
in the bankruptcy action  stormedia seeks to disallow our proof of claim on the grounds that under bankruptcy code section b and applicable state law  our claims against stormedia are unenforceable and not allowable because we rejected stormedia s products for reasons other than quality 
stormedia further seeks a determination pursuant to bankruptcy code section b and applicable state law that our claims are unenforceable and not allowable because stormedia is entitled to a setoff in an amount exceeding our claims 
stormedia further seeks a determination that under bankruptcy code section c and applicable state law that any allowable claim by us is equitably subordinated to all allowed claims of stormedia s other creditors 
in addition  stormedia also asserts in the bankruptcy action counterclaims against us and cross claims against hei asserting breach of volume purchase agreement  breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  promissory fraud and fraud and deceit 
on december   hei and maxtor filed motions seeking an order of the bankruptcy court providing that the bankruptcy court will abstain from hearing the bankruptcy action pursuant to usc sec 
c 
in december of  the bankruptcy court entered an order extending the deadline for maxtor and hei to file an answer or other responsive pleading in the bankruptcy action through the earlier of i entry of an order on the abstention motions  or ii february  on or about february   the bankruptcy court approved a stipulation entered into among maxtor  hei and stormedia  which provided in part  that the bankruptcy court will abstain from the bankruptcy action pursuant to usc sec 
c 
the stipulation also provided that the automatic stay imposed by the bankruptcy court will be modified to allow all parties to the colorado action to proceed to final  non appealable judgment or settlement 
in addition  the parties have agreed that any award of damages pursuant to final  non appealable judgment entered by the colorado court in our favor or any final  non appealable stipulated judgment or other form of settlement entered into in the colorado action in our favor  will be deemed to be a valid claim under applicable non bankruptcy law for the purposes of allowance in stormedia s bankruptcy cases  subject  however  in all respects to the determination of the bankruptcy court of all issues within the bankruptcy court s exclusive jurisdiction the bankruptcy court matters  including  but not limited to i the extent to which stormedia holds defenses that arise exclusively under the bankruptcy code to the allowance of such claim in stormedia s bankruptcy cases  ii the classification of such claim under the plan  iii the extent to which such claim may be equitably subordinated pursuant to usc sec 
 and iv the extent to which such claim may reduce our liability to stormedia  if any as determined by a final non appealable judgment of the colorado court  pursuant to usc the bankruptcy court matters will remain subject to bankruptcy court jurisdiction and will be stayed and held in abeyance until such time as the colorado court has fully resolved the colorado action by entry of a final  non appealable judgment or settlement 
we believe that we have valid defenses against the claims alleged by stormedia and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
however  due to the nature of litigation and because the pending lawsuits are in the very early pre trial stages  we cannot determine the possible loss  if any  that may ultimately be incurred either in the context of a trial or as a result of a negotiated settlement 
the litigation could result in significant diversion of time by our technical personnel  as well as substantial expenditures for future legal fees 
after considering the nature of the claims and facts relating to the litigation  including the results of preliminary discovery  our management believes that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  the results of these proceedings  including any potential settlement  are uncertain and there can be no assurance that they will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
we were sued in the united states district court for the northern district of california by papst motoren gmbh and papst licensing collectively papst claiming infringement of a number of hard disk drive motor patents 
the lawsuit alleges infringement of of the hard disk drive motor patents  which relate to motors that we purchase from motor vendors and the use of such motors in hard disk drives 
we filed our answer and counterclaim on may   alleging defenses of implied license  patent exhaustion  misuse  invalidity  unenforceability and noninfringement  among others 
we have also filed a motion to bifurcate for early discovery the license  exhaustion and misuse defenses 
at hearing on july   the court stayed further action in the case pending the outcome of a motion filed by papst on july   seeking coordination and transfer of this case with several other actions involving papst patents 
this motion was filed with the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation in washington  dc the motion was granted october   and the case has been transferred to the eastern district of louisiana for coordinated or consolidated pre trial proceedings with three other actions involving papst patents 
the consolidated proceedings are still in their initial stages  and there has been no formal discovery taken by maxtor 
we deny any wrongdoing and intend to vigorously defend ourselves 
while the final outcome of these claims cannot be determined at this time  we believe that resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations
