item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative special income charge operating income net sales our net sales of million in fiscal increased by million  or  over fiscal  and net sales of million in fiscal increased by million  or  over fiscal our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales 
microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for of our total net sales in fiscal  of our total net sales in fiscal and of our total net sales in fiscal a related component of our product sales consists primarily of serial eeprom memories which accounted for of our total net sales in fiscal  of our total net sales in fiscal and of our total net sales in fiscal our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter  which we refer to as turns orders  and shipments from backlog 
the percentage of turns orders has fluctuated over the last three years 
currently  we are experiencing turns orders at the lowest point of the historical range for net sales requirements 
despite the recent improvement in the turns orders requirement from our business  turns orders are difficult to predict  and we may not experience the combination of turns orders and shipments from backlog in any quarter that would be sufficient to achieve anticipated growth in net sales 
if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter  our revenues and operating results would be adversely affected 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product 
the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant  while average selling prices of our memory products have  until recently  declined over time 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines  due primarily to competitive conditions 
we have been able to maintain average selling prices by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices  thereby offsetting price declines in older products 
we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller or other products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future  which would reduce our operating results 
the foregoing statements regarding turns orders  average selling prices and pricing pressures are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter  inventory mix and timing of customer orders  competition and competitive pressures on pricing and product availability  customers inventory levels  order patterns and seasonality  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by the company s products  market acceptance of the products of both the company and its customers  demand for the company s products  fluctuations in production yields  production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization  changes in product mix  and absorption of fixed costs  labor and other fixed manufacturing costs 
distributors accounted for of our net sales to customers in fiscal  of our net sales to customers in fiscal and of our net sales to customers in fiscal sales to foreign customers represented of our total net sales in fiscal  of our total net sales in fiscal and of our total net sales in fiscal our sales to foreign customers have been predominantly in asia and europe  which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for consumer  automotive  office automation  communications and industrial products 
the majority of foreign sales are us dollar denominated 
we enter into hedging transactions from time to time to minimize exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years  there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future 
our quarterly operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability  many of which are beyond our control 
some of the factors that may affect our operating results include the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter turns orders market acceptance of both our products and our customers products customer order patterns and seasonability availability of manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yield the availability and cost of raw materials  equipment and other supplies  and economic  political and other conditions in the worldwide markets served by us 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any comparisons as indications of future performance 
in future periods  our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 
gross profit in fiscal years  and  our gross profit was million  million and million  respectively 
gross profit as a percent of sales was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the most significant factor affecting gross profit percentage in each of these years was the higher growth rate of microcontrollers and associated application development systems relative to our serial eeprom memory products 
we continue to transition products to smaller geometries and to larger wafer sizes to reduce future manufacturing costs 
we continue to increase our manufacturing capacity for inch wafers and to transition products to our micron process 
in fiscal  products produced on inch wafers grew from at the beginning of the fiscal year to at the end of the fiscal year 
we anticipate that gross product margins will fluctuate over time  driven primarily by the product mix of microcontroller products and related memory products  manufacturing yields  fixed cost absorption  wafer fab loading levels and competitive and economic conditions 
we believe that expansion of our manufacturing capacity is important to enable us to respond to increased sales opportunities and maintain satisfactory delivery schedules 
our business could suffer if the expansion of manufacturing capacity is delayed or inefficiently implemented 
other companies in the industry have experienced difficulty in expanding manufacturing capacity  resulting in reduced yields or delays in product deliveries 
we may experience manufacturing yield or delivery problems in the future  which could harm our operating results 
the foregoing statements relating to anticipated gross product margins  the transition to higher yielding manufacturing processes and the expansion of our manufacturing capacity are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others fluctuations in production yields  production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization  cost and availability of raw materials  absorption of fixed costs  labor and other direct manufacturing costs  the ability to increase manufacturing capacity as needed  the timing and success of manufacturing process transition  demand for our products  competition and competitive pressure on pricing  changes in product mix  and other economic conditions 
currently  the majority of our assembly operations  and a portion of our test requirements  are performed by third party contractors located throughout asia 
our reliance on third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over these portions of our business 
while we review the quality  delivery and cost performance of these third party contractors  there can be no assurance that reliance on third party contractors will not adversely impact results in future reporting periods if any third party contractor is unable to maintain assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 
third party assembly and test companies are experiencing high demand and utilization of their current capacity which could lead to capacity shortages in the industry 
accordingly  we are in the process of implementing in house assembly operations and have shifted a portion of our assembly operations from third party contractors to fill this capacity 
as of the end of fiscal  approximately of our assembly requirements was being performed in our thailand facility 
we are dependent on third party contractors for the balance of our requirements 
the foregoing statements related to capacity at third party assembly and test companies are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others timing and success of the transition from third party assembly services providers to in house assembly operations  delay in the facilitation of our in house assembly operations  difficulties in the transition of the assembly function from third parties to our in house facility  availability of sufficient capacity of third parties  supply disruption  labor unrest  changes in product mix  competitive pressures on prices  and other economic conditions 
our reliance on foreign operations  and maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods in inventory in foreign locations exposes us to foreign political and economic risks  including political  social and economic instability trade restrictions and changes in tariffs import and export license requirements and restrictions difficulties in staffing and managing international operations disruptions in international transport or delivery fluctuations in currency exchange rates difficulties in collecting receivables  or potentially adverse tax consequences 
to date  we have not experienced any significant interruptions in our foreign business operations 
if any of these risks materialize  our sales could decrease and our operations performance could suffer 
research and development we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products  including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technology 
we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position 
the dollar investment in research and development in fiscal increased by from the fiscal year  and by from fiscal compared to fiscal our future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis which can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements 
the success of new product introductions depends on various factors  including proper new product selection timely completion and introduction of new product designs development of support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use  and market acceptance of our customers end products 
because our products are complex  we have experienced delays from time to time in completing development of new products 
in addition  our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance 
we may be unable to design  develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis  which could reduce our future operating results 
our future success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies 
semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require large research and development expenditures 
other companies in the industry have experienced difficulty in effecting transitions to smaller geometry processes and to larger wafers and  consequently  have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries 
we believe that our transition to smaller geometries and to larger wafers is important for us to remain competitive 
our future operating results could be reduced if the transition is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 
selling  general and administrative during fiscal  we increased our level of selling  general and administrative costs to million as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative costs represented of sales in fiscal as compared to and of sales in the previous two fiscal years 
effective april   we terminated our contractual relationships with predominately all manufacturers representatives in the americas 
we are currently adding additional resources to our existing direct sales force focusing on the americas territories 
we anticipate that all resources will be in place by june  we believe that this transition can be completed without affecting operating results  however  there can be no assurance that we can attract and retain qualified personnel according to this timeline 
termination costs of million associated with this business change were included in operating expenses in the quarter ended march  we expect selling  general and administrative costs to rise over time as we continue to invest in incremental worldwide sales and technical support resources to promote our embedded control products 
the foregoing statements related to the addition of resources to our americas direct sales force are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others our ability to attract and retain qualified sales personnel  and general economic conditions 
other income expense interest income in fiscal increased from fiscal as a result of higher invested cash balances  and decreased from fiscal as a result of lower invested cash balances 
interest expense in fiscal decreased over fiscal and due to lower borrowing levels associated with the company s credit facilities 
other income represents numerous immaterial non operating items 
provision for income taxes provisions for income taxes reflect tax on foreign earnings and federal and state tax on us earnings 
we had an effective tax rate of for the years ended march   and  respectively  due primarily to lower tax rates at our foreign locations 
we believe that our tax rate for the foreseeable future will be approximately 
the foregoing statement regarding the company s anticipated future tax rate is a forward looking statement 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others current tax laws and regulations  taxation rates in geographic regions where we have significant operations  and current tax holidays available in foreign locations 
year issue the year issue arose as a result of certain computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
to date  we have not experienced problems complying with year issues  nor have we experienced any material year related issues or had any year related issues reported to us by our business partners 
should any year issues occur at a later time  however  we believe they would most likely be able to be resolved in the normal course of business 
euro conversion issues we operate in the european market and currently generate approximately one third of our total net sales from customers located in europe 
our commercial headquarters in europe are located in the united kingdom  which is not currently one of the eleven member states of the european union converting to a common currency 
we currently conduct of our business in europe in us dollars and of our business in europe in pounds sterling 
the balance of our net sales is conducted in currencies which will eventually be replaced by the euro 
we will monitor the potential commercial impact of converting a portion of our current business to the euro  but we do not currently anticipate any material impact to our business based on this transition 
we do not currently anticipate any material impact to our business related to euro matters from information technology  derivative transactions  tax issues and accounting software issues 
liquidity and capital resources we had million in cash and cash equivalents at march   an increase of million from the march  balance 
during the fiscal year ended march   and through may   we maintained an unsecured line of credit with a syndicate of domestic banks totaling million 
borrowings under the domestic line of credit as of march  were million 
we were required to achieve certain financial ratios and operations results to maintain the domestic line of credit 
we were in compliance with these covenants at march  we also maintain an unsecured short term line of credit totaling million with certain foreign banks 
there were no borrowings under the foreign line of credit as of march  there are no covenants related to the foreign line of credit 
at march   an aggregate of million of these facilities was available  subject to financial covenants and ratios with which we were in compliance 
our ability to fully utilize these facilities was dependent on our remaining in compliance with such covenants and ratios 
on may   we entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks totaling million 
we can elect to increase the facility to million  subject to certain conditions set forth in the credit agreement 
this new facility has a termination date of may  this facility replaces the million line of credit described above 
we are required to achieve certain financial ratios and operations results to maintain this line of credit 
our ability to fully utilize this credit facility is dependent on our being in compliance with such covenants and ratios 
during the year ended march   we generated million of cash from operating activities  an increase of million from the year ended march   and an increase of million from the year ended march  the increase in cash flow from operations during fiscal year was primarily due to increased profitability  the impact of special charges  and the impact of changes in accounts payable  and accrued liabilities and other assets and liabilities 
our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment in each of these periods 
we currently intend to spend approximately million during the next months for additional capital  including equipment to increase capacity at our existing wafer fabrication facilities acquisition of the puyallup  washington semiconductor manufacturing complex expansion of product test operations development of in house assembly capability  and incremental infrastructure to support the growth of the business 
we expect to finance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operations  available debt arrangements and other sources of financing including issuance of equity and debt securities depending on market conditions 
we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next months will provide sufficient additional manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 
in support of our longer term growth objectives  we recently signed an agreement to acquire a semiconductor manufacturing complex in puyallup  washington 
closing on the purchase is expected to occur by july  please see the discussion on the puyallup facility under part i business manufacturing  at page  above 
the foregoing statements regarding the anticipated level of capital expenditures over the next months  the financing of such capital expenditures and the anticipated closing date of the purchase of the puyallup semiconductor manufacturing complex  are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products  market acceptance of our products and of our customers products  demand for our products  utilization of current manufacturing capacity  the availability and cost of raw materials  equipment and other supplies  and the economic  political and other conditions in the worldwide markets served by us 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended march  net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended march  and million for the year ended march  proceeds from sale of stock and put options were million for the year ended march   million for the year ended march and million for the year ended march  payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and in fiscal repayments on lines of credit were million for the year ended march  net proceeds from lines of credit were million in fiscal and in fiscal cash expended for the purchase of our common stock was million in fiscal and million in fiscal during the year ended march   we purchased  shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of  during the year ended march   we received  shares and in the year ended march   we received  shares in conjuction with a net share settled forward contract 
we also received  in conjunction with a net share settled forward contract  which was credited to additional paid in capital 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
the net share settled forward contract could obligate us to purchase shares of our common stock in the future if the price of our common stock is below the strike price of the instruments 
also  in connection with a stock repurchase program  during fiscal  we sold put options for  shares of common stock at pricing per share which ranged from to 
during fiscal  we purchased put options for  shares of common stock 
the net proceeds from the sale and repurchase of these options  in the amount of  for fiscal  has been credited to additional paid in capital 
during the year ended march   put options for  shares of common stock were purchased at the settlement dates at a total cost of  as of march   we had no outstanding put options 
during the year ended march   we completed two transactions in connection with the stock repurchase program 
in april  we completed a costless collar transaction involving call options for  shares of common stock priced at and put options for  shares of common stock priced at 
the expiration date of the transaction was april   resulting in us receiving  which was credited to additional paid in capital 
also  in connection with the stock repurchase program  we completed a net share settled forward contract for  shares of common stock at an average price of per share 
the expiration date of this transaction is may with quarterly interim settlement dates 
we expect from time to time to purchase shares of common stock in connection with its authorized stock purchase program 
we will also have cash requirements associated with our purchase and facilitization of the puyallup semiconductor manufacturing complex  which is described under part i business manufacturing  at page  above 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  the semiconductor industry is capital intensive 
in order to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant investments in capital equipment  for both production and research and development 
we may seek additional equity or debt financing during the next months for the capital expenditures required to acquire  maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product test facilities  or other purposes 
the timing and amount of any such capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our products  product mix  changes in industry conditions and competitive factors 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  and any additional equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing investors 
recently issued accounting pronouncement in march  the financial accounting standards board  referred to as fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  referred to as fin no 
fin no 
clarifies the application of apb opinion no 
by clarifying the definition of an employee  the determination of noncompensatory plans and the effect of modifications to stock options 
we do not believe the adoption of fin no 
will impact our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities  was million as of march   and million as of march  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels of march  and march   the decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be material 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize an adverse impact in income or cash flows 
we have international operations and are thus subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
to date  our exposure related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant 
if the foreign currency rates fluctuate by from the rates at march  and march   the effect on our financial position and results of operation would not be material 
during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discuss in this item a  and collectability of accounts receivable 
we constantly assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
