quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks relate to changes in the prices received from sales of oil and natural gas 
the company s primary risk management strategy is to partially mitigate the risk of adverse changes in its cash flows caused by deceases in oil and natural gas prices by entering into derivative commodity instruments  including commodity futures contracts and price swaps 
by hedging only a portion of its market risk exposures  the company is able to participate in the increased earnings and cash flows associated with increases in oil and natural gas prices  however  it is exposed to risk on the unhedged portion of its oil and natural gas production 
historically  the company has attempted to hedge the exposure related to its forecasted oil and natural gas production in amounts which it believes are prudent based on the prices of available derivatives and  in the case of production hedges  the company s deliverable volumes 
the company does not use or hold derivative instruments for trading purposes nor does it use derivative instruments with leveraged features 
the company s derivative instruments are designed and effective as hedges against its identified risks  and do not of themselves expose the company to market risk because any adverse change in the cash flows associated with the derivative instrument is accompanied by an offsetting change in the cash flows of the hedged transaction 
notes and to the financial statements provide further disclosure with respect to derivatives and related accounting policies 
all derivative activity is carried out by personnel who have appropriate skills  experience and supervision 
the personnel involved in derivative activity must follow prescribed trading limits and parameters that are regularly reviewed by the company s chief executive officer 
all hedges or open positions are reviewed by the chief executive officer before they are committed to  and significant positions are reviewed by the company s board of directors 
the company uses only well known  conventional derivative instruments and attempts to manage its credit risk by entering into financial contracts with reputable financial institutions 
following are disclosures regarding the company s market risk instruments 
investors and other users are cautioned to avoid simplistic use of these disclosures 
users should realize that the actual impact of future commodity price movements will likely differ from the amounts disclosed below due to ongoing changes in risk exposure levels and concurrent adjustments to hedging positions 
it is not possible to accurately predict future movements in oil and natural gas prices 
the company periodically hedges a portion of the price risk associated with the sale of its oil and natural gas production through the use of derivative commodity instruments  which consist of commodity futures contracts and price swaps 
these instruments reduce the company s exposure to decreases in oil and natural gas prices on the hedged portion of its production by enabling it to effectively receive a fixed price on its oil and natural gas sales 
during  the company sold  barrels of oil 
a hypothetical decrease of per barrel of the average price received during the year would decrease the company s production revenues by  during  assuming that oil production remains at levels 
the company sold bcf of natural gas in a hypothetical decrease of 
per mcf of the average price received during the year would decrease the company s production revenues by  for  assuming that natural gas production remains at levels
