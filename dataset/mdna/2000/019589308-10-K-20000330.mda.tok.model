item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
introduction we have experienced significant growth  primarily resulting from the acquisition of solid waste businesses 
since january   we have completed acquisitions including acquisitions in our consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the acquisition of companies accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations in and the results of operations for the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method for business combinations are included in our financial statements only from the applicable date of acquisition 
as a result  we believe our historical results of operations for the periods presented are not directly comparable to our current results of operations 
in june  we acquired the rabanco companies rabanco in a transaction accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations 
rabanco provided solid waste collection  recycling  transportation and disposal services in the pacific northwest and generated annual revenue of approximately million  excluding the effects of the internalization of waste volumes 
in august  we acquired illinois recycling services  inc and its affiliates illinois recycling in a transaction accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations 
illinois recycling provided solid waste collection  recycling and transportation services primarily in the chicago metropolitan area and northern indiana and generated annual revenue of approximately million  excluding the effects of the internalization of waste volumes 
in october  we acquired american disposal services  inc adsi in a transaction accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations 
adsi was a vertically integrated solid waste management company providing collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services to approximately  customers in states  primarily in the midwest and northeast united states and generated annual revenue of approximately million  excluding the effects of the internalization of waste volumes 
in december  we completed a private offering of an aggregate of billion of senior notes 
the proceeds were used to retire indebtedness and leases and for general corporate purposes 
on july   we completed the acquisition of bfi in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
as a result of the acquisition  each share of bfi common stock was converted into the right to receive in cash 
including assumed and refinanced debt  the cost of acquiring bfi was approximately billion 
financing for the acquisition was obtained from draws of billion from credit facilities with a capacity of billion the credit facility  the sale of billion of newly issued senior convertible preferred stock the preferred stock and the sale of billion of senior subordinated notes due the notes 
with the completion of the acquisition of bfi  we operate in states and serve approximately million commercial and residential customers from a base of assets including active landfills  transfer stations  recycling facilities and collection companies 
in connection with the acquisition of bfi  we initiated an asset divestiture program  whereby we would sell  for cash or through simultaneous buy and sell transactions  certain non core assets that do not fit with our vertical integration operating strategy 
the net proceeds from this initiative are expected to generate approximately billion net of approximately million of tax 
as of december   we had completed divestitures  which generated million of proceeds and were comprised of the sale of the shares of sita  sa  the sale of the bfi medical waste operations and the sale of certain non core  non integrated assets 
additionally  we have entered into various agreements to divest of bfi s canadian operations  bfi gas services and other non core  non integrated assets  which are expected to generate approximately million of proceeds 
these divestitures are recorded as assets held for sale in the consolidated financial statements as of december  and are expected to be completed during in connection with the sale of these identified assets  we anticipate entering into definitive agreements to acquire certain assets which would further integrate existing markets 
we anticipate spending approximately million on such acquisitions during we also intend to divest other non core assets during which we would anticipate generating approximately million of proceeds 
these assets have not been specifically identified and approved for sale by management and the board of directors and are not classified as assets held for sale at december as of february   we had completed the sales of assets subsequent to year end for approximately million and acquired assets for approximately million  which were pending as noted above 
status of integration of bfi 
in connection with the acquisition of bfi on july   we anticipated annual cost savings of approximately million by the end of resulting from corporate and field sg a savings  operations labor cost savings  market cost savings and asset buy and sell agreements 
as of december   we had achieved approximately million in annual cost savings through headcount reductions of approximately  employees  the closure of facilities  route rationalizations and other cost savings 
internalization increased from at the time of the acquisition to at december  the remaining million of cost savings is expected to be achieved in in connection with the completion of the divestiture initiative  which includes asset buy and sell agreements 
additionally  as of december   we have completed the management information systems conversions from bfi s systems to allied s systems for financial reporting  payroll  fixed assets and maintenance tracking 
subsequent to december   we completed the conversion of the general ledger and accounts payable from bfi s sap system to allied s system 
we have not experienced any significant operational  accounting or reporting issues related to these conversions 
accounting policies 
subsequent to the acquisition of bfi  we evaluated our capitalized interest policy to assess the methodology of the calculation with the change in the business strategy resulting from the acquisition 
under the new methodology  the area of the landfill under development is defined as only the portion of the permitted acreage currently undergoing active cell development 
the costs upon which interest is capitalized continue to include the actual acquisition  permitting and construction costs incurred for cell development 
consistent with the prior policy  as construction of an area is completed and the area becomes available for use  the cell no longer qualifies for interest capitalization 
the adoption of this method  which was accounted for as a change in accounting principle  reflects the change in our operating strategy as a result of the bfi acquisition 
the impact of the change in accounting principle was a cumulative charge in of approximately million  net of related income tax benefit 
general revenues 
our revenues are attributable primarily to fees charged to customers for waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services 
we generally provide collection services under direct agreements with our customers or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
commercial and municipal contract terms  generally range from one to five years and commonly have automatic renewal options 
our landfill operations include both company owned landfills and those operated for municipalities for a fee 
in each geographic region in which we are located  we provide collection  transfer and disposal services 
the following tables show for the periods indicated the percentage of our total reported revenues attributable to services provided and revenues attributable to geographic regions 
the data below has been restated to give effect to acquisitions that were accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations 
year ended december  collection transfer landfill other total revenues year ended december  atlantic central great lakes midwest northeast southeast southwest west total revenues the portion of collection and third party transfer revenues attributable to disposal charges for waste collected by us and disposed at our landfills has been excluded from collection and transfer revenues and included in landfill revenues 
our strategy is to develop vertically integrated operations to ensure internalization of the waste we collect and thus realize higher margins from our operations 
by disposing of waste at company owned and or operated landfills  we retain the margin generated through disposal operations that would otherwise be earned by third party landfills 
approximately of the waste we collect as measured by disposal volumes was disposed of at landfills we own and or operate in which includes the results of operations of bfi since july  in addition  transfer stations are an integral part of the disposal process 
we locate our transfer stations in areas where our landfills are outside of the population centers in which we collect waste 
such waste is transferred to long haul trailers and economically transported to our landfills 
expenses 
cost of operations includes labor  maintenance and repairs  equipment and facility rent  utilities and taxes  the costs of ongoing environmental compliance  safety and insurance  disposal costs and costs of independent haulers transporting our waste to the disposal site 
disposal costs include certain landfill taxes  host community fees  payments under agreements with respect to landfill sites that are not owned  landfill site maintenance  fuel and other equipment operating expenses and accruals for estimated closure and post closure monitoring expenses anticipated to be incurred in the future 
we use a life cycle accounting method for landfills and the related closure and post closure liabilities 
this method applies the costs associated with acquiring  developing  closing and monitoring the landfills over the associated landfill capacity based on consumption 
on an annual basis  we update the development cost estimates which include the costs to develop the site as well as the individual cell construction costs  closure and post closure cost estimates and future capacity estimates for each landfill 
the cost estimates are prepared by local company and third party engineers based on the applicable local  state and federal regulations and site specific permit requirements 
future capacity estimates are updated  using aerial surveys of each landfill performed annually  by third party engineers to estimate utilized disposal capacity and remaining disposal capacity 
these cost and capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually 
selling  general and administrative expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead  sales cost  community relations expenses and provisions for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of other intangible assets and landfill airspace 
we use the units of production method for purposes of calculating the amortization rate at each landfill 
this methodology divides the costs associated with acquiring  permitting and developing the entire landfill by the total remaining capacity of that landfill 
the resulting per unit amortization rate is applied to each unit disposed at the landfill and is recorded as expense for that period 
costs associated with developing the landfill include direct costs such as excavation  liners  leachate collection systems  engineering and legal fees  and capitalized interest 
estimated total future development cost for our active landfills is approximately billion  excluding interest to be capitalized  and we expect that this amount will be spent over the remaining operating lives of the landfills 
we have available disposal capacity of approximately billion cubic yards of capacity as of december  goodwill amortization includes the amortization of costs paid in excess of the net assets acquired in purchase business combinations 
in connection with potential acquisitions  we incur and capitalize certain transaction costs and integration costs  which include stock registration  legal  accounting  consulting  engineering and other direct costs 
when an acquisition is completed and is accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations  these costs are charged to the statement of operations as acquisition related costs 
when a completed acquisition is accounted for using the purchase method for business combinations  these costs are capitalized 
we routinely evaluate capitalized transaction and integration costs  and we expense those costs related to acquisitions not likely to occur 
we expense indirect acquisition costs  such as executive salaries  general corporate overhead and other corporate services  as incurred 
we capitalize certain direct landfill development costs  such as engineering  construction and permitting costs  and amortize based on consumed airspace 
we believe that the costs associated with engineering  owning and operating landfills will increase in the future as a result of federal  state and local regulation and a growing community awareness of the landfill permitting process 
we cannot assure you whether we will be able to raise prices sufficiently to offset these increased expenses 
we expense all indirect landfill development costs  such as executive salaries  general corporate overhead  public affairs and other corporate services  as incurred 
closure and post closure costs represents our financial commitment for the regulatory required costs associated with our future obligations for final closure  which is the closure of a cell of a landfill once the cell is no longer receiving waste  and post closure monitoring and maintenance of landfills  which is usually required for up to years after a landfill s final closure 
we establish closure and post closure requirements based on the standards of subtitle d as implemented on a state by state basis 
we base closure and post closure accruals on cost estimates for capping and covering a landfill  methane gas control  leachate management and groundwater monitoring  and other operational and maintenance costs to be incurred after the site discontinues accepting waste 
we prepare site specific closure and post closure engineering cost estimates annually for landfills owned and or operated by us for which we are responsible for closure and post closure 
we accrue and charge closure and post closure costs based on accepted tonnage as landfill airspace is consumed to ensure that the total closure and post closure obligations are fully accrued for each landfill at the time that the site discontinues accepting waste and is closed 
for landfills purchased  we assess and accrue the closure and post closure liability at the time we assume closure responsibility based upon the estimated closure and post closure costs and the percentage of airspace utilized as of the date of acquisition 
after the date of acquisition  we accrue and charge closure and post closure costs as airspace is consumed 
we update and approve estimated closure and post closure liabilities annually based on assessments performed by in house and independent environmental engineers 
such costs may change in the future as a result of permit modifications or changes in legislative or regulatory requirements 
we accrue closure and post closure cost estimates based on the present value of the future obligation 
we discount future costs where we believe that both the amounts and timing of related payments are reliably determinable 
we annually update our estimates of future closure and post closure costs 
we account for the impact of changes  which are determined to be changes in estimates  on a prospective basis 
in  we calculated the net present value of the closure and post closure commitment assuming inflation of and a risk free capital rate of 
we accrete discounted amounts previously recorded to reflect the effects of the passage of time 
we currently estimate total future payments for closure and post closure to be billion 
the present value of such estimate is billion 
at december  and  accruals for landfill closure and post closure costs including costs assumed through acquisitions were approximately million and million  respectively 
the accruals reflect a portfolio of landfills with estimated remaining lives  based on current waste flows  that range from one to over years  and an estimated average remaining life of approximately years 
year update 
we did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in our operating or business systems when the date changed from to based on operations since january   we do not expect any significant impact to our ongoing business as a result of the year issue 
however  it is possible that the full impact of the date change  which was of concern due to computer programs that use two digits instead of four digits to define years  has not been fully recognized 
we believe that any future problems are likely to be minor and correctable 
in addition  we could still be negatively affected if the year or similar issues adversely affect our customers or suppliers 
we currently are not aware of any significant year or similar problems that have arisen for our customers and suppliers 
we will continue to monitor year matters in our ongoing operations and as a part of our acquisition due diligence 
we spent less than  on year readiness efforts 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship that the various items bear to revenues and the percentage change in dollar amounts for the periods indicated 
we have restated the statement of operations data to give effect to acquisitions that were accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations

revenues in were billion compared to billion in  an increase of 
the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to the acquisition of bfi on july  and the inclusion in our results of bfi revenues for the period july  through december  bfi s pro forma revenue adjusted to reflect the sale of bfi s canadian operations and medical waste operations was approximately billion 
cost of operations 
cost of operations in was billion compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase in cost of operations was primarily attributable to the inclusion of bfi s cost of operations associated with the revenues from july  through december  as a percentage of revenues  cost of operations increased to in from in  primarily due to the change in revenue mix resulting from the acquisition of bfi 
bfi s revenue mix was more heavily weighted towards collection revenue  which has lower margins than landfill revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses in were million compared to million in  an increase of  and reflects our acquisition of bfi 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a decreased to in from in this decrease is the result of achieving the cost savings associated with the acquisition of bfi and significantly increasing the revenues as noted above 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization in was million compared to million in  an increase of  and reflects our acquisition of bfi 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expense decreased to in from in the decrease is primarily due to the significant increase in revenues from our acquisition of bfi which more than offset the corresponding increase in depreciation due to the acquisition of bfi 
additionally  as required by generally accepted accounting principles  we ceased recording depreciation on assets held for sale during such depreciation would have been approximately million 
goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization in was million compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase in goodwill amortization was due to an increase in goodwill of approximately billion primarily resulting from the acquisition of bfi 
acquisition related and unusual costs 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of acquisition related and unusual costs primarily associated with the billion acquisition of bfi  which was accounted for as a purchase 
the costs primarily relate to environmental related matters  litigation liabilities  risk management liabilities  loss contract provisions  transition costs  the write off of deferred costs relating to the acquisition 
these costs are comprised of the following we recorded a charge of approximately million related to changes in estimates of environmental liabilities associated with bfi s operations 
in connection with our due diligence and integration process  assessments of the acquired operations were performed by third party and in house engineers 
based on these assessments  we made changes in accounting estimates of approximately i million associated with the superfund accrual for over cercla cases in which bfi was involved  ii million associated with the remedial accrual for sites in which bfi was involved with remedial action plans  iii million associated with the environmental accrual for various containment and treatment matters at active or closed bfi landfills  and iv million associated with the accrual for the remedial and closure requirements of four bfi hazardous waste facilities 
management believes the environmental accrual as of december  represents the most probable outcome of these matters 
we do not expect that adjustments to these estimates  which are reasonably possible in the near term and that may result in changes to recorded amounts  will have a material effect on our consolidated liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
as of december   we believe that it is possible that the ultimate outcome of the environmental matters could result in approximately million of additional liability 
we recorded a charge of approximately million related to changes in estimates of litigation liabilities associated with bfi s operations 
in connection with our due diligence and integration process  assessments of the acquired operations and outstanding litigation were performed by third party and in house legal counsel 
we evaluated over cases involving employee related matters  insurance related matters  regulatory matters  collection matters and contract disputes 
accordingly  we increased the litigation accrual based on the most probable loss to be incurred 
management believes the litigation accrual as of december  represents the most probable outcome of outstanding assessments  claims and cases 
we do not expect that adjustments to estimates  which are reasonably possible in the near term and that may result in changes to recorded amounts  will have a material effect on our consolidated liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
as of december   we believe that it is possible that the ultimate outcome of the litigation matters could result in approximately million of additional liability 
we recorded an increase of approximately million to the self insurance accruals based on the results of a third party actuarial review performed in connection with due diligence and integration of the bfi acquisition 
as of september   we instituted a guaranteed cost insurance program for all casualty insurance coverages 
as a result  we are fully insured for any such claims occurring subsequent to that date 
in connection with the integration of the bfi acquisition  we reviewed the existing contracts of the business for recoverability 
several contracts were identified which were in a loss position when the direct costs excluding any non variable costs attributable to the contract were deducted from the revenue to be generated by the contract 
consistent with our accounting policies  we recorded a charge of approximately million to operations for the anticipated excess of costs over revenues of the identified contracts 
as a result of the acquisition of bfi  management reassessed the level of acquisitions that it would pursue in the future and decided that certain companies that were being considered will no longer be pursued 
accordingly  we wrote off million of deferred charges previously incurred in connection with these potential acquisitions 
additionally  we wrote off million of commitment fees paid in connection with a portion of the financing of the bfi acquisition 
these fees were associated with funds that were not ultimately drawn due to alternative sources of financing becoming available 
however  as secured financing for the entire purchase price of the acquisition was a condition of the signing of the merger agreement with bfi  and the debt associated with these fees was not incurred  the cost was written off at the time of the acquisition 
in connection with the integration plan for bfi  we identified and notified approximately  employees that they would be retained for a specified period  generally not exceeding months from the acquisition date  to perform transition related functions 
subsequent to the specified time period  they will be terminated 
additionally  we identified certain offices and operations  which are duplicative  and we are in the process of consolidating these operations 
as these transition costs are not accruable until committed or paid  approximately million of transition costs were expensed during additionally  we accrued approximately million of committed transition costs during the year 
we estimate that we may incur approximately million of additional transition expenses associated with the integration of bfi through the completion of our plan 
additionally  we recorded approximately million of non cash asset impairments related to the valuation of allied assets held for sale  approximately million of non cash asset impairments related to duplicate facilities  and approximately million of restructuring and abandonment costs related to other acquisitions 
any subsequent changes in estimates of acquisition related and unusual costs will be included in the acquisition related and unusual costs caption of the statement of operations in the period in which the change in estimate is made 
during  approximately million of accrued acquisition related costs associated with acquisitions were reversed to acquisition related and unusual costs 
the following table reflects the cash activity related to the acquisition related and unusual costs accrued during in thousands additions balance through non cash remaining expense charges expenditures december  transition costs    restructuring and abandonment costs loss contracts    environmental  litigation  and regulatory compliance costs    asset impairments   total     additionally during  we reversed approximately million of accruals to acquisition related and unusual costs related to acquisitions 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income was million in compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the increase in debt of approximately billion from the acquisition of bfi  which was outstanding for five months in additionally  capitalized interest decreased to million in from million in due to the change in accounting principle 
income taxes 
income taxes reflect an effective tax rate of in and in the effective income tax rate in deviates from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the non deductible nature of certain acquisition related charges and the non deductibility of the amortization related to billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of bfi 
the effective income tax rate in deviates from the federal statutory rate primarily due to applying the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations including the initial recording of deferred income taxes and non deductible transaction costs  partially offset by the absence of income taxes on s corporation pre combination earnings 
without considering the effect of the acquisition related charges the effective tax rate is 
extraordinary loss  net 
in july  in connection with our financing of the bfi acquisition  we replaced our credit facility and recognized an extraordinary charge of approximately million million net of income tax benefit related to the write off of previously deferred debt issuance costs 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net 
in connection with the acquisition of bfi  we changed our capitalized interest policy to more accurately reflect our long term business strategy 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million  net of related tax  during  to reflect the cumulative effect on prior years of the change in the method of interest capitalization 
dividends on preferred stock 
dividends on preferred stock were million in and reflect the dividend on the preferred stock issued on july  in connection with the financing of the acquisition of bfi 
dividends were not paid in cash  instead  the liquidation preference of the preferred stock increased by accrued  but unpaid dividends 
years ended december  and revenues 
revenues in were billion compared to billion in  an increase of 
the increase in revenues attributable to existing operations internal growth was with approximately attributable to net volume increases and approximately attributable to price increases 
the additional revenue growth is attributable to companies acquired net of revenues sold  subsequent to the same period in the prior year 
cost of operations 
cost of operations in was million compared to million in  an increase of 
this increase in cost of operations was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues described above 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of operations decreased to in from in the operating margin decreased from the previously reported margin due to the restatements for companies acquired subsequent to december  and accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations 
the operating margin was favorably impacted by an increase in internalization of third party disposal volumes to in from approximately in  as restated  increased volumes at the landfills  and other cost savings from the integration of acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expense in was million compared to million in  a decrease of 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a decreased to in from in the sg a expense increased from the previously reported amount due to the restatements for companies acquired subsequent to december  and accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations 
the sg a expense decreased due to a reduction in certain sales and administrative functions and related facilities completed at the beginning of the second quarter of in accordance with our continuing acquisition integration plan 
additionally  the decrease in sg a as a percentage of revenues is due to the continued increase in revenues while reducing overhead costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization in was million compared to million in  an increase of 
in addition to the depreciation and amortization of acquired companies  the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to a increase in internalized landfill tonnage and an increase in capital expenditures 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization did not change significantly 
goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization in was million compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase in goodwill amortization was due to a increase in goodwill 
as a percentage of revenues  goodwill amortization did not change significantly 
acquisition related and unusual costs 
during the year ended december   we recorded acquisition related and unusual costs in the amount of million 
these costs consist of transaction and deal costs  employee severance and transition costs  environmental related matters  litigation liabilities  regulatory compliance matters  restructuring and abandonment costs  loss contract provisions and non cash asset impairment charges 
we do not anticipate that future costs to be incurred in connection with the acquisitions will be significant as restructuring and transition activities associated with these acquisitions had been substantially completed as of december  the acquisition related and unusual costs discussed below predominantly relate to acquisitions accounted for as poolings of interests and consist of the following direct transaction and deal costs of million including investment banker  attorney  accountant  environmental assessment and other third party fees 
approximately million was accrued at december  and was paid in the first six months of employee severance and transition costs of million consist of million in termination payments made to employees of acquired companies based on change of control provisions in preexisting contracts and million of costs associated with severance payments under exit or integration plans implemented in connection with acquisitions made during exit plans primarily related to the elimination of duplicate corporate and administrative offices of companies acquired 
integration plans included the combination of field activities for human resource  accounting  facility maintenance  health and safety compliance and customer service activities of companies acquired with field activities similar to ours 
the exit and integration plans called for the termination of approximately employees who performed managerial  sales  administrative support  maintenance and repair  or hauling and landfill operations duties 
all employees were identified and notified of their severance or transition benefits at the time management approved the plan  which occurred at or around the time of the acquisitions 
approximately million was accrued at december   the majority of which has been paid in environmental related matters  litigation liabilities and regulatory compliance matters assumed in acquisitions totaled million 
subsequent to the acquisitions  we made certain changes in accounting estimates due to events and new information becoming available for environmental liabilities of approximately million  litigation liabilities of approximately million and regulatory compliance liabilities of approximately million 
as part of our acquisition due diligence process  environmental assessments were performed at the time of acquisition by third party and in house engineers 
the assessments were performed at over operating sites owned or used by the companies acquired by allied in additional environmental liabilities were accrued based on the results of the assessments and represent the most probable outcome of these identified contingent matters 
additional accrued environmental liability of million was comprised of required remedial activities identified at separate locations 
these locations include eight landfills acquired by allied  landfills not owned by allied  but used for disposal by collection companies acquired  and transfer stations and maintenance facilities acquired 
required remedial activities include containment  the removal of waste improperly disposed of  extraction and treatment of landfill gas  removal and disposal of contaminated soil and groundwater treatment and legal and administrative costs of the settlement of superfund claims 
the additional million of environmental accruals related to removal and treatment of leachate at landfills  the level of which exceeded permitted amounts at seven of the acquired landfills 
at december   approximately million and million was accrued for environmental matters and legal and regulatory compliance matters  respectively  which are expected to be disbursed in future periods 
the change in estimate relating to litigation and regulatory compliance liabilities was accrued based on legal due diligence performed by in house and outside legal counsel for acquired companies at the time of acquisition and the determination of the most probable loss incurred 
as a result of this legal due diligence  we identified companies acquired in business combinations accounted for as poolings of interest which had an aggregate of asserted and unasserted claims involving matters such as contract disputes  employment related disputes  real and personal property and sales tax issues and billing disputes 
additionally  we identified regulatory compliance issues related to companies acquired  which included citations for certain state and federal health  safety and transportation violations and the associated costs of fines  assessments and required maintenance costs to bring facilities and equipment into compliance 
restructuring and abandonment costs were million in business combinations accounted for as pooling of interests 
costs to relocate redundant operations and to transition them to common information systems were million 
redundant operations consisted primarily of activities for human resources  accounting  facility maintenance  health and safety compliance and customer service which were performed in field offices of companies acquired 
abandonment costs and losses on the disposal of duplicate revenue producing assets relating to specifically identified transfer stations and recycling facilities were million 
revenue and net operating income of the abandoned operations represented less than one percent of our consolidated amounts 
additionally  million of costs were incurred for the disposition of redundant non revenue producing assets 
this includes million that was accrued at december  in accordance with exit and integration plans and is expected to be paid in this accrual is for payments under non cancelable lease agreements for corporate offices to be vacated and other costs to close corporate facilities after operations have ceased under exit plans implemented during at five companies acquired 
loss contract provisions were million for losses associated with collection contracts and other contractual obligations assumed in acquisitions 
approximately million was accrued at december  and was paid as of september  non cash asset impairment charges aggregating million were recorded during the fourth quarter of  related to assets held for future use and assets  which were disposed of  in the first and second quarters of interest expense  net 
interest expense net of interest income was million in as compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease in net interest expense was due to an increase in capitalized interest to million in from million in the increase in capitalized interest is a result of the acquisition of landfills during primarily financed with our common stock instead of cash 
therefore  we had a significant increase in assets under development without a corresponding increase in interest bearing debt 
additionally  net interest expense was impacted by an overall reduction in the average interest rate partially offset by a net increase in outstanding debt 
income taxes 
income taxes reflect an effective tax rate of in and in the increase is primarily caused by the income tax accounting effects of asset write downs and applying the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations including the initial recording of deferred income taxes and non deductible transaction costs  partially offset by the absence of income taxes on s corporation pre combination earnings 
this resulted in a one time income tax provision of million 
without considering the effect of pooled companies and asset write downs  the effective tax rate is  which deviates from the federal statutory rate of  due to the effects of differences in the treatment of goodwill for book and tax purposes  state income taxes  and other permanent differences 
extraordinary loss  net 
in december  we replaced our notes and senior discount notes with billion in senior notes and recognized a charge of approximately million million net of income tax benefit related to premiums paid for the early payment of the notes and the senior discount notes and the write off of previously deferred debt issuance costs 
in june  we replaced our credit facility and recognized an extraordinary charge of approximately million million net of income tax benefit related to the write off of previously deferred debt issuance costs 
in september  we sold million shares of common stock with net proceeds of approximately million the equity offering 
we used million of the net proceeds to retire a portion of the term loan facility of the credit agreement as defined below and million to repay the entire amount outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
as a result of the early repayment of debt outstanding under the term loan facility  we recognized an extraordinary charge in the third quarter of of approximately million million net of income tax benefit for the write off of previously deferred debt issuance costs 
in may  we repurchased from laidlaw  inc two junior subordinated debentures with an aggregate face amount of million and a warrant to acquire million shares of common stock  used as partial consideration for the acquisition of the solid waste operations of laidlaw  inc  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
an extraordinary charge to earnings related to the repurchase of approximately million million net of income tax benefit was recorded 
in addition  we replaced our billion bank agreement with the million senior credit facility the credit agreement in june and recognized an extraordinary charge of approximately million million net of income tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have satisfied our acquisition  capital expenditure and working capital needs primarily through bank financing and public offerings and private placements of debt and equity securities 
between january and december  we completed total debt financings in excess of billion and equity financings in excess of billion  excluding stock issued for consideration in business combinations 
due to acquisitions and the capital requirements of our previous business strategy  we have used amounts in excess of the cash generated from operations to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures 
in the future we anticipate that cash flow from operations  less acquisitions and capital requirements  will be sufficient to service our long and short term debt 
however  over the next several quarters  transition and integration costs associated with the bfi acquisition may cause us to have negative cash flow from operations or may cause us to incur additional amounts of debt 
in connection with acquisitions  we have assumed or incurred indebtedness with relatively short term repayment schedules  thereby increasing our current and medium term liabilities 
also  for certain acquisitions  current liabilities are recorded for acquisition related and unusual costs that require payment in the near term 
current liabilities periodically include scheduled payments required under our credit facility 
in addition  we have acquired operating equipment using financing leases  which have short  and medium term maturities 
also we use excess cash generated from operations to pay down amounts owed on our revolving line of credit  which is classified as long term debt 
as a result  we periodically have low levels of working capital or working capital deficits 
during the years ended december   and  our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities were as follows in millions year ended december  operating activities net income loss non cash acquisition related and unusual costs and asset impairments non cash operating expenses cumulative effect of change in accounting principle gain on sale of assets extraordinary losses due to early extinguishments of debt  net of income tax benefit and cash premium paid cash premium paid due to early extinguishments of debt change in operating assets and liabilities  net cash provided by operating activities investing activities cost of acquisitions  net of cash acquired  capital expenditures and net contributions to unconsolidated subsidiaries capitalized interest proceeds from sale of assets change in deferred acquisition costs and notes receivable cash used for investing activities  financing activities net proceeds from sale of common stock and exercise of stock options and warrants net proceeds from sale of preferred stock net proceeds from long term debt  net of issuance costs    repayments of long term debt    other cash provided by financing activities  increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents consists principally of provisions for depreciation and amortization  undistributed earnings of equity investments  allowance for doubtful accounts  accretion of debt and amortization of debt issuance costs  and deferred income taxes 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
our capital expenditure and working capital requirements have increased significantly  reflecting our rapid growth through acquisition and development of revenue producing assets  and will increase further compared to the years ended december  and due to the acquisition of bfi 
during  we acquired solid waste operations  excluding the bfi acquisition  representing approximately million in annual revenues million net of intercompany eliminations  and sold operations representing approximately million in annual revenues 
subsequent to december   we sold certain assets with annual revenues of approximately million for consideration of approximately million 
for the calendar year  we expect to spend approximately million for capital expenditures  closure and post closure  and remediation expenditures relating to our landfill operations 
we also expect to spend approximately million after tax  for non recurring integration and transaction costs primarily related to the acquisition of bfi 
the acquisition of additional waste operations would require additional capital amounts and capital expenditure requirements 
as of december   our debt structure consisted primarily of billion outstanding under the credit facility  billion of the notes  billion of the senior notes and billion of debt assumed in connection with the bfi acquisition 
as of december  there is aggregate availability under the revolving credit facility of the credit facility of approximately billion to be used for working capital  letters of credit  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
the indentures relating to the credit agreement  the notes and the senior notes contain financial and operating covenants and restrictions on our ability to complete acquisitions  pay dividends  incur indebtedness  make investments and take certain other corporate actions 
a substantial portion of our available cash will be required to service this indebtedness 
for fiscal  our debt service is expected to be approximately billion consisting of approximately million in principal repayments and approximately million in interest payments 
these amounts may vary depending upon changes in interest rates 
we are also required to provide financial assurances to governmental agencies under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations and collection contracts 
we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by issuing performance bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits as they relate to landfill closure and post closure costs and performance under certain collection contracts 
at december   we had outstanding approximately billion in financial assurance instruments  represented by million of performance bonds  million of insurance policies  million of trust deposits and million of letters of credit 
during the calendar year  we expect to be required to provide approximately billion in financial assurance instruments relating to our landfill operations 
we have lease facilities the lease facilities that allow us to enter into equipment leases at rates ranging from similar term treasury note rates plus for terms of to months 
we had equipment leases outstanding at december  and of million and million  respectively 
subtitle d and other regulations that apply to the non hazardous waste disposal industry have required us  as well as others in the industry  to alter operations and to modify or replace pre subtitle d landfills 
such expenditures have been and will continue to be substantial 
further regulatory changes could accelerate expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently reserved for such purposes 
these factors  together with the other factors discussed above  could substantially increase our operating costs and our ability to invest in our facilities 
our ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements  to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest  or to refinance our indebtedness  and to fund capital amounts required for the expansion of the existing business depends on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
on the basis of historical financial information  including recent operating history of both allied and bfi  we believe that available cash flow  together with available borrowings under the new credit facility  our lease facilities and other sources of liquidity  will be adequate to meet our anticipated future requirements for working capital  acquisition related and integration costs  letters of credit  capital expenditures  scheduled payments of principal and interest on debt incurred under the new credit facility  the assumed bfi debt  the senior notes  the notes and other debt  and capital amounts required for growth 
however  we may have to refinance the principal payment at maturity on the senior notes  the notes and other debt 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that we will be able to avail ourselves to future financings in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures  or that any refinancing would be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
further  depending on the timing  amount and structure of any possible future acquisitions and the availability of funds under the new credit facility  we may need to raise additional capital 
we may raise such funds through additional bank financings or public or private offerings of our debt and equity securities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure such funding  if necessary  on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are not successful in securing such funding  our ability to pursue our business strategy may be impaired and results of operations for future periods may be negatively affected 
see note to allied s consolidated financial statements

disclosure regarding forward looking statements this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended forward looking statements 
all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report  are forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
generally  these statements relate to business plans or strategies  projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of such plans or strategies  number of acquisitions and projected or anticipated benefits from acquisitions  including whether and when the acquisitions will be accretive to earnings  made by or to be made by us  or projections involving anticipated revenues  earnings  levels of capital expenditures or other aspects of operating results and the underlying assumptions including internal growth as well as general economic and financial market conditions 
all phases of our operations are subject to a number of uncertainties  risks and other influences  many of which are outside of our control and any one of which  or a combination of which  could materially affect the results of our operations and whether forward looking statements made by us ultimately prove to be accurate 
such important factors important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are disclosed in this section and elsewhere in this report 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the important factors described below that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations 
shareholders  potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors in evaluating forward looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements made herein are only made as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to publicly update such forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances 
leverage ability to service debt 
we have substantial indebtedness with significant debt service requirements 
at december   our consolidated debt was approximately billion 
the degree to which we are leveraged has important consequences  including the following i our ability to obtain additional financing in the future may be impaired  ii a portion of our cash flow from operations is required to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes  iii we may be vulnerable in the event of an economic downturn in our business  and iv to the extent our outstanding debt under our credit facility is at variable rates that have not been hedged  we will be vulnerable to increases in interest rates 
in addition  a portion of our bank debt provides for increasing interest rates if that portion is not repaid by july  accordingly  if we are unable to repay this portion from the proceeds of asset divestitures or otherwise  our vulnerability to changes in interest rates will be greater 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future operating performance and financial results  which will be subject in part to factors beyond our control 
although we believe that our cash flow will be adequate to meet our interest payments  we cannot assure that we will continue to generate earnings in the future sufficient to cover our fixed charges and if we are unable to borrow sufficient funds under either the credit facility or from other sources  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our assets 
there can be no assurance that a refinancing would be possible  nor can there be any assurance as to the timing of any asset sales or the proceeds  which we could realize therefrom 
if for any reason  including a shortfall in anticipated operating results or proceeds from asset sales  we were unable to meet our debt service obligations  we would be in default under the terms of certain of our debt agreements 
in the event of such a default  the holders of such debt could elect to declare all of such debt immediately due and payable  including accrued and unpaid interest  and to terminate their commitments with respect to funding obligations under such debt 
in addition  such holders could proceed against any collateral which  in the case of the credit facility  consists of the capital stock of our subsidiaries and substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries 
any default with respect to any of our debt could result in default under other debt or result in bankruptcy 
competition 
the solid waste collection and disposal business is highly competitive and requires substantial amounts of capital 
we compete with numerous waste management companies  one of which has significantly larger operations and greater resources 
we also compete with those counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations 
forward looking statements assume that we will be able to effectively compete with the other waste management companies and municipalities and that we will be able to maintain or improve margins or pricing of services on existing or acquired operations and effectively compete with government owned and operated landfills which enjoy certain competitive advantages from tax exempt financing and tax revenue subsidies 
availability of acquisition targets 
our ongoing acquisition program is part of our growth strategy 
in addition  obtaining landfill permits has become increasingly difficult  time consuming and expensive 
we cannot assure that we will succeed in obtaining landfill permits or locating appropriate acquisition candidates that can be acquired at price levels that we consider appropriate 
the forward looking statements assume that a number of acquisition candidates and landfill properties sufficient to meet our goals will be available and that we will be able to complete the acquisitions at prices that we have experienced in the past two years 
in addition  federal and state antitrust and similar policies may limit our ability to pursue acquisitions 
divestitures 
our forward looking statements assume that we will be able to exit certain regional markets and sell certain non strategic businesses 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when transactions will close or the amounts to be received in such transactions  including transactions under definitive agreement  and whether we will be successful in negotiating asset sales at a pace and on terms sufficient to achieve our goals 
integration 
our financial position and results of operations depend to a large extent on the integration of recently acquired businesses including the acquisition of bfi completed on july  before the acquisition of bfi  allied and bfi operated as separate entities 
we may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that allied or bfi had achieved or might achieve separately 
successful integration of bfi s operations will depend upon our ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs 
because of difficulties in combining operations  we may not be able to achieve the cost savings  increases in internalization rates  and other size related benefits that we hope to achieve after the acquisition 
failure to achieve effective integration in the anticipated time period or at all could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations 
ongoing capital requirements 
to the extent that internally generated cash and cash available under our existing credit facilities are not sufficient to provide the cash required for future operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt repayment obligations and or financial assurance obligations  we will require additional equity and or debt financing in order to provide such cash 
we have incurred significant debt obligations in the last two years  which entail substantial debt service costs 
the forward looking statements assume that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to finance such requirements at rates that are as good as or better than those we are currently experiencing 
we cannot assure  however  that such financing and hedging and other means of fixing interest rates on our debt will be available or  if available  that we will find such terms regarding debt service costs and interest rates consistent with the assumptions of forward looking statements or otherwise satisfactory 
see liquidity and capital resources 
economic conditions 
our business is affected by general economic conditions 
the forward looking statements assume that we will be able to achieve internal volume and price growth  which is not impacted by an economic downturn 
as our revenue continues to grow it is likely that the rates of internal growth will reflect growth rates  which are less than those experienced in we cannot assure that an economic downturn will not result in a reduction in the volume of waste being disposed of at our operations and or the price that we can charge for our services 
weather conditions 
protracted periods of inclement weather may adversely affect our operations by interfering with collection and landfill operations  delaying the development of landfill capacity and or reducing the volume of waste generated by our customers 
in addition  particularly harsh weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of certain of our operations 
the forward looking statements do not assume that such weather conditions will occur 
dependence on senior management 
we are highly dependent upon our senior management team 
in addition  as we continue to grow  our requirements for operations management with waste industry experience will also increase 
the availability of such experienced management is not known 
our chief financial officer announced his forthcoming resignation in february the forward looking statements assume that experienced management will be available when needed by us at compensation levels that are within industry norms 
we may also encounter difficulty in the assimilation and retention of employees 
the loss of the services of any member of senior management or the inability to hire experienced operations management could have a material adverse effect on us 
influence of government regulation and other third party actions 
our operations are subject to and substantially affected by extensive federal  state and local laws  regulations  orders and permits  which govern environmental protection  health and safety  zoning and other matters 
these regulations may impose restrictions on operations that could adversely affect our results  such as limitations on the expansion of disposal facilities  limitations on or the banning of disposal of out of state waste or certain categories of waste or mandates regarding the disposal of solid waste 
because of heightened public concern  companies in the waste management business may become subject to judicial and administrative proceedings involving federal  state or local agencies 
these governmental agencies may seek to impose fines or to revoke or deny renewal of operating permits or licenses for violations of environmental laws or regulations  or to require remediation of environmental problems at sites or nearby properties resulting from transportation or predecessors transportation and collection operations  all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
liability may also arise from actions brought by other third parties such as individuals or community groups in connection with the permitting or licensing of operations  any alleged violations of such permits and licenses or other matters 
the forward looking statements assume that there will be no materially negative impact on our operations due to government regulation or other third party actions 
potential environmental liability 
we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations 
any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
due to the limited nature of our insurance coverage of environmental liability  if we were to incur substantial financial liability for environmental damage  our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the forward looking statements assume that we will not incur any material environmental liabilities other than those for which a provision has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the notes thereto 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we therefore believe we should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require us to absorb cost increases resulting from inflation 
we are unable to determine the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
seasonality we believe that our collection  transfer and landfill operations can be adversely affected by protracted periods of inclement weather which could delay the development of landfill capacity or transfer of waste and or reduce the volume of waste generated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate long term debt 
to modify the risk from interest rate fluctuations  we enter into hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
at december   our variable rate debt consisted of our million senior credit facility which had an average interest rate of and scheduled maturities of million in  million in and million in the book value at december  approximated its fair market value 
we have effectively converted our long term debt  which requires payment at variable rates of interest  to fixed rate obligations through interest rate swap transactions 
these transactions required us to pay fixed rates of interest on notional amounts of principal to counter parties 
the counter parties  in turn  paid to us variable rates of interest on the same notional amounts of principal 
increases or decreases in short term market rates did not impact earnings and cash flow as all variable rate debt had been swapped for fixed rates 
in addition  decreases in long term market interest rates would have the effect of increasing the fair value of our long term debt and other long term  fixed rate obligations 
the following interest rate table shows the interest rate swaps that were in effect and their fair value as of december  fair market notional principal interest interest value in thousands maturity paid underlying obligations received in thousands  april credit agreement term loan facility libor  october credit agreement term loan facility libor  november credit agreement term loan facility libor  november credit agreement term loan facility libor  march credit agreement term loan facility libor  september credit agreement term loan facility libor see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information regarding how we manage interest rate risk at december
