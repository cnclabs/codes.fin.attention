item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general over the periods presented  the company has focused its efforts on providing an expanding array of new product offerings and strengthening its relationships with its customers 
to that end  the company has made significant investments to increase market penetration  primarily in the form of product development  customer service  customer credits and allowances  and strategic acquisitions 
the company calculates its net sales by subtracting credits and allowances from gross sales 
credits and allowances include costs for co operative advertising  product returns  discounts given to customers who purchase new products for inclusion in their stores  and the cost of competitors products that are purchased from the customer in order to induce a customer to purchase new product lines from the company 
the credits and allowances are designed to increase market penetration and increase the number of product lines carried by customers by displacing competitors products within customers stores and promoting consolidation of customers suppliers 
the company may experience significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter in its results of operations due to the timing of orders placed by the company s customers

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
with the exception of the company s revolving credit facility  long term debt obligations are at fixed interest rates and denominated in us dollars 
the company manages its interest rate risk by monitoring trends in interest rates as a basis for determining whether to enter into fixed rate or variable rate agreements 
under the terms of the company s revolving credit facility  a change in either the lender s base rate or libor would affect the rate at which the company could borrow funds thereunder 
the company believes that the effect of any such change would be minimal 
although the company continues to evaluate derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate changes  the company does not currently hold derivatives for managing these risks or for trading purposes
