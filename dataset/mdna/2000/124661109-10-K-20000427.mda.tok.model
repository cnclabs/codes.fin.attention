item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all dollar amounts in this item are in thousands  except per share amounts and per pound lead amounts 
impact of economy and shift in customer demand during fiscal  primarily due to continued improved domestic economic conditions  there was a higher demand for our standby power products sold by the powercom division 
raw material pricing and productivity lead  steel  copper  plastics and electronic components are the major raw materials used in the manufacture of our industrial batteries and electronics products and  accordingly  represent a significant portion of our materials costs 
during fiscal  and  the average north american producer price of lead was  
and 
per pound  respectively 
we have a long term cost containment program to maximize manufacturing efficiency 
under the program  we continue to allocate a significant amount of our normal annual capital expenditures to cost containment and productivity improvement projects 
inflation the cost to us of manufacturing materials and labor and most other operating costs are affected by inflationary pressures 
our ability to pass along inflationary cost increases through higher prices may be limited during periods of stable or declining lead prices because of industry pricing practices that tend to link product prices and lead prices 
we believe that  over recent years  we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases by o effective raw materials purchasing programs  o price increases of our products  o increases in labor productivity  and o improvements in overall manufacturing efficiencies 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items in c d s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal year net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating income interest expense  net other expense  net income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes net income before minority interest minority interest net income fiscal compared to fiscal all comparisons are with the corresponding periods in the previous year  unless otherwise stated 
effective march   c d purchased substantially all of the assets of the specialty battery division of jci  a designer  manufacturer  marketer and distributor of industrial batteries based in milwaukee  wisconsin 
these assets included certain assets of johnson controls technology company  a wholly owned subsidiary of jci and all of the ordinary shares of johnson controls battery uk limited  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of jci 
in addition  on august  we completed the acquisition of jci s percent ownership interest of a joint venture battery business in shanghai  china 
the joint venture manufactures  markets and distributes both industrial and starting  lighting and ignition batteries  the latter for the chinese market only 
for reporting purposes  the acquisition of the specialty battery division and jci s percent ownership interest in the joint venture battery business in shanghai  china have collectively been re named the dynasty division by c d 
net sales for fiscal increased  or percent to  from  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to sales of  recorded by the dynasty division including the sales of the joint venture in china  coupled with higher sales by the powercom and motive power divisions  partially offset by lower power electronics divisional sales 
sales by the powercom division increased  or percent over the prior year primarily due to higher sales to the telecommunications market 
motive power divisional sales increased  or five percent over fiscal mainly as a result of higher sales of motive power chargers 
fiscal sales by the power electronics division decreased  or eight percent versus the prior year primarily due to lower sales of custom power supplies and cellular phone battery chargers  partially offset by higher dc to dc converter sales 
gross profit for fiscal increased  or percent to  from  in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit during fiscal was primarily due to the gross profit generated by the dynasty division including gross profits of the joint venture in china  as well as increased gross profits related to the higher sales volumes provided by the powercom division  partially offset by lower gross profits from the power electronics division 
motive power gross profit in fiscal increased slightly over the prior year 
the decrease in the gross profit of the power electronics division during fiscal versus the prior year was mainly due to i lower sales volumes  ii a  inventory charge for slow moving inventory  and iii related to a restructuring charge 
this restructuring charge  which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal  consisted of a  pre tax charge or 
per share after tax  primarily related to the restructuring of the power electronics division see restructuring charge below 
the restructuring charge included related to inventory obsolescence that was charged to cost of sales 
the balance of the restructuring charge  or  was charged to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased  or percent over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to higher expenses including amortization of goodwill and intangible assets related to the acquisition of the dynasty division and the aforementioned  restructuring charge 
also contributing to this increase was higher motive power divisional fixed selling expenses due to warranty and sales branch expenses coupled with higher selling expenses of the powercom division related to increased sales volumes during fiscal these increases were partially offset by lower selling expenses of the power electronics division during fiscal compared to the prior year 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal over the prior year  primarily as a result of costs incurred by the recently acquired dynasty division and higher research and development expenses related to the powercom and motive power divisions 
these increases were partially offset by lower research and development expense incurred by the power electronics division during fiscal versus the prior year 
operating income increased  or percent to  from  in the prior year after the aforementioned  restructuring charge and  inventory charge for slow moving inventory 
this increase was primarily the result of operating income generated by the dynasty division including operating income of the joint venture in china of  coupled with higher powercom divisional operating income of  partially offset by lower motive power operating income of  and an operating loss in the power electronics division  compared to operating income in the prior year 
interest expense  net  increased  in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily due to higher debt balances outstanding used to finance the current year acquisition of the dynasty division 
other income  net  for fiscal was versus other expense  net  of in fiscal mainly as a result of higher prompt payment discounts and non operating income in fiscal  partially offset by higher foreign exchange and financial services expenses 
income tax expense for fiscal increased  from fiscal  primarily as a result of higher income before income taxes and an increase in the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate consists of statutory rates adjusted for the tax impacts of our foreign sales corporation  research and development credits  and foreign operations 
the effective tax rate for fiscal increased to percent from percent in the prior year mainly due to less tax benefits associated with our foreign operations  research and development tax credit and foreign sales corporation 
minority interest of in fiscal reflects the percent ownership of the joint venture battery business located in shanghai  china that is not owned by c d 
as a result of the above  for fiscal  net income increased  or percent to  or per common share basic and per common share assuming dilution 
restructuring charge during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pre tax charge of  or 
per share after tax  primarily relating to the restructuring of the power electronics division 
 of this pre tax charge is included in selling  general and administrative expenses with the remaining included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended january  the primary purpose of the restructuring was to improve the profitability of our power electronics division by reducing labor costs  overhead and improving logistics management 
as a result  we expect the restructuring to result in lower operating costs estimated to yield annual savings of approximately  we began to realize these operational savings during the fourth quarter of fiscal the restructuring charge consisted of estimated costs to close our costa mesa  california power supply production facility as well as contractual severance liabilities associated with the non renewal of the employment contracts of two of our former officers 
with respect to the closing of the costa mesa  california production facility  we implemented a restructuring plan that consisted of transferring production primarily to our existing facility in nogales  mexico 
major actions of the restructuring plan consisted of i disposition of inventory  ii write off of impaired property  plant and equipment that was not transferred to other facilities  and iii termination of the power electronics costa mesa  california work force 
details of the restructuring charge are as follows balance at cash non cash january  provision reductions activity write off of inventory write down of property  plant and equipment employee severance other total  the inventory write off was determined based upon identification of inventory associated with discontinued products 
this inventory was disposed of during the second quarter of fiscal the write down of impaired property  plant and equipment was determined based upon the estimated cost to completely write down the net book value of assets not transferred to other facilities 
we completed the disposition of the impaired property  plant and equipment during the third quarter of fiscal employee severance of was charged to selling  general and administrative expenses and provided for a reduction of approximately employees  consisting of production and administrative employees related to the power electronics costa mesa  california facility  and two former officers of c d 
all employee terminations were completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal  with payments being made in accordance with contractual agreements through fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal increased  or two percent to  from  in fiscal this was a result of an increase in sales by the powercom and motive power divisions  up nine percent and four percent  respectively  partially offset by a percent decrease in sales by the power electronics division 
the increase in powercom divisional sales was primarily due to higher sales to the telecommunications and control markets in fiscal versus the prior year 
power electronics divisional sales were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower power conversion sales to both the telecommunications and non telecommunications markets 
power electronics telecommunications sales were lower in fiscal due to lower sales of cellular phone battery chargers 
on a company wide basis  telecommunications related sales were approximately percent of total c d sales during fiscal versus percent in fiscal gross profit for fiscal increased  or six percent to  from  in the prior year  resulting in a gross margin of percent versus percent in the prior fiscal year 
gross margin increased as a result of improved gross margin in the powercom division due to lower material costs and improved operating efficiencies  as well as improved motive power divisional gross margin related to lower material costs 
power electronics divisional gross margin decreased in fiscal versus the prior year primarily as a result of lower sales volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased  or three percent over the prior year due to higher selling expenses  partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses 
selling expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal due to higher commission expenses and higher payroll and new motive power divisional sales branch location related costs 
general and administrative expenses were lower in fiscal compared to the prior year due to the absence in fiscal of costs related to the accelerated write off of goodwill and intangible assets associated with lh due to impairment that occurred in fiscal  lower costs associated with the resolution of legal disputes and lower consulting costs 
during fiscal we determined that there was an impairment of certain assets arising from the lh acquisition based on the undiscounted net cash flows of the underlying assets 
an impairment loss of  was recorded for the write off of goodwill in the amount of and intangible assets in the amount of which were determined to have a fair value of zero 
the write off did not include any tangible assets 
research and development expenses remained proportional to sales as a relative percentage for both fiscal and at approximately three percent of sales 
operating income increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal as a result of higher powercom divisional operating income  flat motive power divisional operating income and lower power electronics divisional operating income 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our power electronics division incurred an operating loss 
interest expense  net  decreased to in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances during fiscal other expense  net  decreased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the absence in the current year of amortization expense associated with the write off of capitalized debt acquisition costs in the amount of related both to our credit facility and the development authority of rockdale county industrial revenue bonds which were written off due to the renegotiation of our credit facility and the early payment of the development authority of rockdale county industrial revenue bonds  respectively 
also contributing to this decrease was higher prompt payment discounts in fiscal versus the prior year and a lower foreign exchange loss in fiscal compared to fiscal income tax expense increased  from fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to higher levels of income before income taxes  which was partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate consists of statutory rates adjusted for the tax impacts of our foreign sales corporation  research and development credits  and foreign operations 
the effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to percent from percent in the prior year mainly due to increased tax benefits associated with our foreign operations and research and development tax credit  partially offset by a reduced tax benefit from the foreign sales corporation 
as a result of the above  for fiscal  net income rose percent from fiscal to  or per common share basic and per common share assuming dilution 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities increased  or percent to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was primarily due to i an increase in net income  ii an increase in depreciation and amortization mainly associated with the acquisition of the dynasty division  iii a decrease in inventory during the current year versus an increase in the prior year  iv a larger increase in accounts payable  v a larger increase in accrued liabilities mainly due to increased accruals related to sales volume rebates  commissions and accrued interest associated with the higher debt levels  and vi an increase in income taxes payable during fiscal compared to a decrease in the same period of the prior year 
these changes  resulting in higher net cash provided by operating activities  were partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable during fiscal compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales volumes in fiscal net cash used by investing activities totaling  for fiscal includes our purchase of the specialty battery division of jci and the acquisition of jci s percent ownership interest in a joint venture battery business in shanghai  china 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for fiscal versus net cash used of  in the prior year 
proceeds from new borrowings in fiscal were used primarily for the funding of the aforementioned acquisitions 
on march  we entered into a credit agreement in which the lenders named therein  and bank of america formerly nationsbank  na as administrative agent  provided a  credit facility consisting of a term loan in the amount of  and a revolving loan not to exceed  the funds borrowed under this credit agreement were used to finance the aforementioned acquisitions  working capital and certain other expenditures and to refinance existing debt 
our availability under the current loan agreement is expected to be sufficient to meet our ongoing cash needs for working capital requirements  debt service  capital expenditures and possible strategic acquisitions 
capital expenditures during fiscal were incurred primarily to fund capacity expansion  new product development  a continuing series of cost reduction programs  normal maintenance capital  and regulatory compliance 
fiscal capital expenditures are expected to exceed  for similar purposes 
year we recognized the need to ensure that our operations would not be adversely affected by year computer problems  and thus developed and implemented a year readiness plan 
our plan addressed the following four areas o information technology systems consisting of computer hard ware and software related to our business systems as well as our engineering and test equipment  o non information technology systems including embedded technology such as microcontrollers  which are typically found in such things as telephone systems  security systems  fax machines  etc  o products sold to customers  and o third party issues including significant suppliers and customers 
our year readiness plan generally included the following phases for each of the four areas noted above o identification and risk assessment  o development and implementation of a remediation plan  o acceptance testing  and o contingency planning for high risk critical areas 
we believe that the year problem was successfully addressed through our year initiatives 
we did not experience any difficulties related to the year problem on january  and have not experienced any year difficulties since that date 
our operations have not  to date  been adversely affected by any difficulties experienced by any of our suppliers or customers in connection with the year problem 
we will continue to monitor our systems for potential year difficulties through the remainder of calendar year we believe the costs directly related to addressing our year problem were not material 
these costs were paid from internal funds and were expensed 
to date  percent of the total year project costs have been incurred 
we have not tracked the internal costs incurred in connection with addressing the year problem  however we believe that such costs consist principally of the related payroll costs for our information systems group and are not material 
no other significant information technology projects were deferred due to our year efforts 
conversion to the euro currency on january   the euro was adopted as the common legal currency  in coexistence with the national currencies for european union member nations until january  we have made necessary adjustments to our processes to ensure compliance during the three year transitional period that ends january  after this transitional period  the euro becomes the sole legal currency for the european union member nations and all of our records of the national currencies will be converted to the euro equivalent at that time 
we do not expect the euro adoption to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes new procedures for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and supersedes and amends a number of existing standards 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
by delaying its effective date by one year to fiscal years beginning after june  we currently use derivatives such as interest rate swap agreements  currency swaps and currency forwards to effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our floating rate debt and the exchange rate on a portion of our foreign assets  liabilities and cash flows 
under current accounting standards  no gain or loss is recognized on changes in the fair value of these derivatives 
under these statements  gains or losses will be recognized based on changes in the fair value of the derivatives which generally occur as a result of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are currently evaluating the financial impact of adoption of these statements 
we believe that the adoption of these statements will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk all dollar amounts in this item a are in thousands 
market risk factors we are exposed to various market risks 
the primary financial risks include fluctuations in interest rates and changes in currency exchange rates 
we manage these risks by using derivative instruments 
we do not invest in derivative securities for trading purposes  but do enter into hedging arrangements in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as well as to fluctuations in exchange rates 
see derivative financial instruments in the summary of significant accounting policies  note  and fair value of financial instruments  note our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk consist of debt instruments and interest rate swap contracts 
the net market value of our debt instruments was  and  at january  and  respectively 
the debt instruments are subject to variable rate interest and therefore the market value is not sensitive to interest rate movements 
the interest rate swap contracts are entered into in order to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our underlying variable rate debt instruments 
we employ separate swap transactions rather than fixed rate obligations to take advantage of the lower borrowing costs associated with floating rate debt while also eliminating possible risk related to refinancing in the fixed rate market 
the net market value of our interest rate swaps was  and at january  and  respectively 
a basis point increase in rates at january  and would result in an and a increase in the market value  respectively 
a basis point decrease in rates at january  and would result in an and a decrease in the market value  respectively 
the above sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their levels  with all other variables held constant 
we calculate the market value of the interest rate swaps by utilizing a standard net present value model based on the market conditions as of the valuation date 
we use currency forwards and swaps to hedge anticipated cash flows in foreign currencies 
the exposures currently hedged are the canadian dollar and the euro 
these financial instruments represent a net market value of and at january  and  respectively 
to monitor our currency exchange rate risk  we use sensitivity analysis to measure the impact on earnings in the case of a devaluation of the canadian dollar and euro to the us dollar 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables being held constant 
at january  and  a strengthening of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar and the euro would result in an increase of the net market value of the forwards and swaps of and  respectively 
at january  and  a weakening of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar and the euro would result in a decrease in the net market value of the forwards and swaps of and  respectively 
the market value of the instruments was determined by taking into consideration the contracted interest rates and foreign exchange rates versus those available for similar maturities in the market at january  and  respectively 
foreign exchange forwards and swap contracts are used to hedge our firm and anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
there is either a balance sheet or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and substantially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis
