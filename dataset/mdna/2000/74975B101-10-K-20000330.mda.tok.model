item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview rwd technologies  inc  provides a broad range of integrated solutions designed to improve the productivity and effectiveness of workers in complex operating environments 
the company s principal service segments are information technology services  enterprise resource planning services  lean manufacturing consulting  and technology performance support 
the substantial majority of the company s contracts are on a time and materials basis  although many of these contracts contain initial not to exceed fees and company performance obligations 
the remainder of the company s contracts are on a fixed price basis  particularly those related to the company s information technology services 
all revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
the company typically bills contracts monthly  and senior management reviews outstanding accounts receivable balances regularly to monitor client satisfaction and collections 
historically  a large percentage of the company s revenue has come from follow on business from its existing clients 
for example  in each of the past five years  more than percent of the year s total revenue was generated by clients who had been clients in the previous year 
gross profit margins per project and professional staff utilization rates are critical to the company s financial performance 
the company manages these parameters by carefully establishing and monitoring project budgets and timetables and by closely tracking staffing requirements for projects in progress and projects that are anticipated 
the status of all projects in progress and personnel utilization are reviewed semi monthly by project managers  first line supervisors  and senior management to ensure client satisfaction and to monitor performance relative to internal financial and operating expectations 
the number of professionals assigned to a project varies according to the size  complexity  duration  and demands of the project 
professional staff utilization rates vary from period to period not only because of variations in the company s volume of business  but because of the timing of employee vacations  hiring and training  the amount of time spent by employees on marketing  and project terminations or postponements 
the company continues its strategic relationships with several companies that have become significant to the success of rwd and its growth in the past several years 
the company has strategic alliances or partner status with software companies and provides services to clients implementing software products of sap  as well as documentum  siebel  lotus  point  dataware  dlb  microsoft  netscape  and peoplesoft 
these relationships are generally terminable upon little or no notice  and an unanticipated change in the working relationship with a strategic alliance organization could materially impact the company s results and prospects for future growth 
the company experienced a significant reduction in its business in the second half of  with a higher level of profitability in the first quarter of the year 
this resulted primarily from reduced staff utilization due to declining demand for it and erp services in the second half of the year 
in addition  quarterly revenue growth and margins are substantially dependent on many factors  which are outside of the company s control  including the timing of new contract awards  the timing of individual project start ups  and the level of activity with ongoing projects 
client engagements are generally terminable with little or no notice or penalty  and a client s unanticipated decision to terminate or postpone a project may result in revenue fluctuations as well as higher than expected unassigned company professionals or severance expenses 
the principal components of cost of services are compensation and benefits to the company s professional staff 
cost of services also includes training and travel expenses for the company s professional staff  fees paid to subcontractors  facilities costs  and depreciation of capital equipment provided to the professional staff 
time devoted by professional personnel to marketing is included in cost of services  as are costs associated with administrative personnel who directly support the company s professional staff 
general and administrative expenses are primarily composed of salaries for corporate  accounting  dedicated sales and other headquarters executive and administrative personnel  as well as other corporate overhead

capital expenditures currently are funded from available cash  although the company may consider alternative financing methods  such as equipment leases or asset based borrowings in future periods 
the company believes its available cash balances  cash provided by future operations and its line of credit will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and other cash needs at least through the year effects of inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s business during the past three years 
the company cannot predict what effect  if any  inflation may have on its future results of operations 
business risks certain statements contained herein  including statements regarding development of the company s services  markets  and future demand for the company s services  and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts  are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 
such forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties  consequently  actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied thereby 
the following are some of the factors that could cause the company s actual future results of operations to differ materially from management s expectations and historic trends 
strategic alliances 
the company s relationships with allies  particularly sap and siebel  as well as documentum  lotus  point  dataware  microsoft  netscape  peoplesoft  and asymetrix have been  or are anticipated to be  important sources of revenue 
the company also faces potential competition from software companies  including its alliance organizations who  through their client services groups  may choose to compete with the company 
most of these relationships are informal or terminable by either party with minimal notice 
the termination of  or adverse change in  any of these alliances or relationships  particularly sap  could impact the company s ability to achieve its revenue and profitability goals 

geographic expansion 
the company continues to expand its operations and marketing efforts in europe and the united kingdom  including establishing offices and expatriating employees  thereby incurring significant operating costs 
if these efforts fail to produce revenue at expected levels or within the timeframe predicted by management  operating margins in would be adversely impacted 
also  international operations present a number of risks  such as adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  cultural differences and possible changes in taxes  laws  and policies governing the operations of foreign based companies 
the company has no control over these factors  any of which could adversely affect the company s results of operations and demand for its services abroad 

enterprise resource planning industry 
during  a substantial portion of the company s revenue growth came from services provided to clients implementing erp software systems developed by sap and others 
during  sales of erp software by the major software vendors slowed significantly  and industry observers are predicting a modest increase in demand for erp implementation services in as a result  the company expects that in  its erp service sector will improve its financial performance  but not experience the unusually high growth it experienced in results for erp services remain difficult to forecast 

rapidly changing information technology sector 
the information technology industry is subject to significant and rapid changes in technology and the demand for particular products and services 
recent examples include the shift in demand away from custom software development in favor of e commerce and web based solutions 
if the company fails to identify shifting demand in the information technology sector or does not develop the expertise necessary to provide services for which there is new demand  the company s revenue growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
during the second half of  revenues for the company s information technology services declined primarily because clients delayed or canceled several projects as a result of concerns about their yk mitigation efforts 
the company expects improved performance from its information technology services during 
customer and industry revenue concentration 
the company continues to derive a substantial amount of its revenue from a limited number of key clients 
in  the company s top five clients and ten clients represented percent and percent of the company s total revenue respectively  with clients in the automotive industry generating percent of total revenue 
most of the company s engagements have no minimum purchase requirements and may be terminated by the client with little or no notice to the company 
many of these clients operate in cyclical industries  such as petrochemicals and automobiles  which are subject to economic factors that affect the clients revenue and profitability 
if any of the company s major clients discontinue doing business with the company or reduce the amount of services they purchase from the company  the company s revenue growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

attracting and retaining personnel 
as is the case with most technology companies  the company experiences significant turnover in its technical staff 
the company s growth will continue to depend on its ability to attract  develop  and retain a sufficient number of skilled professional employees 
technically qualified personnel are in short supply  and there is intense competition for qualified people 
also  the company will need to ensure that its technical personnel keep current on rapid changes in technology 
the company s operating costs may be higher than management expects if competition for qualified people increases 

increasing competition 
in recent years  the company has experienced heightened competition  particularly in the erp and it segments of its business 
if competition continues to intensify  the company may find it more difficult to grow its revenue at rates comparable to historic growth rates and to maintain its profit margins at historic levels 
year compliance the company completed year compliance testing certifying of all hardware  software  and ancillary equipment critical to continuous business operations by september  all operations related hardware  software  and ancillary equipment was compliant by that date 
the company experienced no year related business interruptions subsequent to january  the company is not aware of any non compliance that would have a material effect on its operations if not replaced or that would be costly to replace 
the company delivers software solutions to clients and believes that all such software delivered over the past several years is year compliant 
because some such software becomes the property of the client  the company has no control over modifications to the software by the client or over its integration with other software  either of which could potentially cause year compliance difficulties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not have significant interest rate risk related to its line of credit  which has an interest rate equivalent to the day libor rate percent on december  plus 
percent 
the company does not have significant foreign currency risk related to foreign sales because of the minimal amount of funds maintained in foreign payroll and operating accounts  and since most non united states revenues are paid in us currency by us national firms 
the company does not have any derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments such as interest swaps  foreign currency forwards  futures and options  and foreign currency denominated debt 
the company does not have commodity price risk or other relevant market risks
