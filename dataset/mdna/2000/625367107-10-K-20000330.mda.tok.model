multex 
com s actual results and timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere herein

on march   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  of which  shares were issued and sold by multex 
com  at a price of per share 
net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering were added to our working capital 
we continue to expand our operations and have grown from employees at december  to employees at december  we expect to add additional personnel both in the united states and abroad as our operations expand 
we currently expect to significantly increase our operating expenses both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenues in order to expand our sales and marketing operations  to continue to expand internationally and to continuously upgrade and enhance our services and technologies 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and as of december  had an accumulated deficit of million 
in addition  we have recorded cumulative deferred compensation of million  which represents the difference between the exercise price of stock options for shares of common stock granted to some of our employees and the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
of the total deferred compensation amount   was amortized prior to december  and  was amortized during the year ended december  the remaining deferred compensation amount will be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the related options 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that the results for any period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
historically  a few of our subscribers and distributors have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues 
for the year ended december   merrill lynch accounted for of our consolidated revenues 
for the years ended december  and  reuters group plc accounted for and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues

operations discontinued operations net loss our revenues have increased in all quarters presented as a result of increased acceptance of multexnet  which was launched in june  multexexpress  which was launched in january  multex investor  which was launched in november  increased purchases of the multex research on demand service  which was launched in april  and the continued growth in the number of companies licensing the market guide database 
our gross margins fluctuate due to several factors 
increased prices and improved operating efficiencies lead to an increase in gross margin  which is also enhanced when significant volumes of professional services are supplied 
in other quarters  when we have significant amounts of equipment resale transactions  including  for example  in the three months ended march   gross margin tends to decrease 
operating expenses have increased in dollar terms during the quarters presented 
sales and marketing expenses have increased in dollar terms as a result of increased personnel and increased marketing  advertising and promotional activity 
research and development expenses increased in dollar terms as a result of expanded technological development efforts to support the launch of new services and to enhance the features and functionality of its services 
our quarterly revenues  margins and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
causes of these fluctuations have included and may include  among other factors  demand for our services  the size and timing of both new and renewal subscriptions  the number  timing and significance of new services introduced by us and our competitors  our ability to develop  market and introduce new and enhanced services on a timely basis  the level of service and price competition  changes in operating expenses  changes in the mix of services offered  changes in our sales incentive strategy  sharp declines in the volume or price levels of securities transactions and general economic factors 
any one or more of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition  and makes the prediction of results of operations on a quarterly basis unreliable 
see risk factors fluctuations in multex 
com s operating results may negatively impact our stock price 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities as we have not generated cash flow from operations since our inception 
through december   we have received an aggregate of million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock and convertible preferred stock 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases 
net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was million in the year ended december   and million in the equivalent period in the principal use of cash for all periods was to fund our losses from operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december   and million in the equivalent period in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to purchases of marketable securities and the acquisition of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended december   and million for the equivalent period in net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of net proceeds from the sale of equity securities in the march initial public offering 
net cash provided by discontinued activities was  in the year ended december   compared to net cash used in discontinued operations of  for the equivalent period in net cash provided by discontinued operating activities reflects proceeds from the gain on sale of market guide s creditrisk monitor division in january although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we anticipate that we will experience a substantial increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments consistent with our anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel  including the implementation of an off site backup computer system and various capital expenditures associated with expanding our facilities 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience significant growth in our operating expenses for the foreseeable future and that our operating expenses will be a material use of our cash resources 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures at least for the next twelve months 
impact of the year the year issue is the result of computer systems and software products coded to accept or recognize only two digit entries in the date code field 
these systems may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year year issues have not had any material impact on multex 
com 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency rate fluctuations our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows are not materially affected by changes in the relative values of non us currencies to the us dollar 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit our foreign currency risk exposure 
interest rate fluctuations our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows are not materially affected by changes in market interest rates 
we have no long term debt obligations 
we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  risk factors that may affect future results because we have a limited operating history  there is limited information upon which you can evaluate multex 
com s business although multex 
com commenced operations in april  all of our current services were launched since june accordingly  we have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business 
in order to be successful  we must increase our revenues from subscription fees for multexnet  from development  hosting and subscription fees for multexexpress  generate additional sales of investment research on a pay per view basis through multex research on demand  attract more users to multex investor and increase license fees from the market guide database 
however  as a company in the new and rapidly evolving market for the distribution of investment research and other information over the internet  we face numerous risks and uncertainties 
some of these risks relate to our ability to 
anticipate and adapt to the changing internet market  
attract more subscribers  
continue to collect investment research and other financial information from our research and information providers  
implement our sales and marketing initiatives  both domestically and internationally  
attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  
respond to actions taken by our competitors  
continue to build an infrastructure to effectively manage our growth and handle any future increased usage  and 
integrate acquired businesses  technologies  products and services 
if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
multex 
com has a history of losses since our incorporation  we have not been profitable on an annual or quarterly basis 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we continue to experience operating losses and negative cash flows and will continue to incur significant operating expenses and make capital investments in our business 
we may not ever generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
at december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have financed our operations to date primarily through the sale of equity securities 
fluctuations in multex 
com s operating results may negatively impact our stock price our revenues  margins and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include 
demand for our services  
the size and timing of new and renewal subscriptions and licensing agreements  
the number  timing and significance of new services introduced by both us and our competitors  
our ability to develop  market and introduce new and enhanced services on a timely basis  
the level of service and price competition  
changes in operating expenses  
changes in the mix of services offered  
changes in our sales incentive strategy  
sharp declines in the volume of securities transactions or the prices of securities generally  and 
general economic factors 
our cost of revenues consists principally of distribution fees and royalties  which fluctuate depending upon the demand for our services  external development costs and fixed telecommunications costs 
in addition  a substantial portion of our operating expenses is related to personnel costs  marketing programs and overhead  which cannot be adjusted quickly and are therefore relatively fixed in the short term 
our operating expense levels are based  in significant part  on our expectations of future revenues on a quarterly basis 
if actual revenues on a quarterly basis are below management s expectations  or if our expenses precede increased revenues  both gross margins and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected because a relatively small amount of our costs and expenses varies with our revenues in the short term 
the loss of a major research or information provider would harm multex 
com s business we are dependent upon the continued provision of high quality investment research reports from investment banks  brokerage firms and third party research providers 
some of these arrangements are not embodied in written contracts and some of these arrangements can be terminated by the provider on short notice 
at present  more than half of our approximately information providers permit us to offer the research for sale after a specified embargo period  generally seven to fifteen days 
the remaining information providers do not permit these sales 
many of our providers of research reports and other information compete with one another and  to some extent  with us for subscribers 
none of these information providers have arrangements to provide research or information exclusively to us 
the loss of one or more significant information providers would decrease the research and other information which we can offer our users and would have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
royalty payments and distribution fees to research providers and strategic partners increase multex 
com s costs royalties and distribution fees payable to our information providers and strategic partners to obtain distribution rights to research reports included in multex research on demand constitute a significant portion of our cost of revenues 
if we are required to increase the royalties or fees payable to these information providers or strategic partners  these increased payments could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
because some of multex 
com s competitors are parties to exclusive distribution agreements  we may not be able to get content from important research providers a number of leading investment banks  brokerage firms and third party research providers are parties to exclusive distribution arrangements with our competitors  including first call corporation and the investext group  both of which are subsidiaries of thomson financial services  inc  a leading worldwide provider of financial information services 
consequently  we cannot provide our users with the investment research and other information provided by these investment banks  brokerage firms and third party research providers  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage 
in the event that additional investment banks  brokerage firms and third party research providers enter into exclusive distribution arrangements or that we are hindered in our ability to offer our own services due to the lack of content from these investment banks  brokerage firms and third party research providers  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
the inadvertent distribution of research reports could result in a claim for damages against multex 
com or harm our reputation our proprietary software technology enables us to restrict distribution of a particular research report or other financial information to those users who have been authorized or entitled to access the report by the information provider 
we might inadvertently distribute a particular report to a user who is not so authorized or entitled  which could subject us to a claim for damages by the information provider or which could harm our reputation in the marketplace  either of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
multex 
com s business would be materially and adversely affected if the emerging market for online investment research does not continue to grow the market for the distribution of investment research and other information over the internet has only recently begun to develop  is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants who have introduced or developed electronic investment research distribution services by facsimile and over public and private networks  online services and the internet 
as is typical of a rapidly evolving market  demand and market acceptance for new services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
because the market for our services is new and rapidly evolving  it is difficult to predict with any assurance the growth rate  if any  and the ultimate size of this market 
we cannot assure you that the market for our services will develop or that our services will ever achieve market acceptance 
if the market fails to develop  develops more slowly than expected  or becomes saturated with competitors  if our services do not achieve market acceptance  or if pricing becomes subject to significant competitive pressures  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
our future results of operations will depend  in substantial part  on our ability to increase the market acceptance of our services 
the future viability of multexnet will depend upon  among other factors  our ability to expand our direct and indirect sales and marketing channels  to attract and retain high quality information providers and to deliver our services across multiple delivery platforms 
the future viability of multexexpress will depend upon  among other factors  the continued desire of investment banks  brokerage firms and other information providers to distribute proprietary investment research and corporate documents over the internet or through private networks to their employees and customers 
the future viability of multex research on demand will depend upon  among other factors  the acceptance of the internet as a medium for the distribution and sale of investment research  as well as on our ability to build a direct and indirect sales force to sell our services  to attract and retain high quality information providers  and to develop and increase our base of users 
the future viability of multex investor will depend upon  among other factors  the acceptance of the internet as a medium for the distribution and sale of investment research to individual investors  and our ability to attract and retain advertisers and sponsors  new members and additional distribution partners 
in addition  in order to download research reports and other information from multex investor  users are required to first download the adobe acrobat reader  which may be difficult for some users to accomplish 
if we are unable to increase the number of users of multexnet  multexexpress  multex research on demand and multex investor  or to attract and retain information providers  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
multex 
com is dependent on strategic distribution relationships and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were to lose one of our strategic distributors we have distribution arrangements for our services with a number of third party distributors  including america online  inc  bloomberg lp  dow jones co 
inc  bridge information systems  inc  factset research systems and reuters limited  all of which are currently generating revenues for us  and with bridge information systems  inc  which is not currently generating revenues for us 
we are dependent on our strategic relationships for the marketing and distribution of investment research reports and other information 
our future results of operations will be affected by the extent to which customers of these third party distributors choose to subscribe to our various services 
we cannot assure you that the customers of these third party distributors will continue to subscribe to our services or that these third party distributors will continue to actively market our services 
if we are unable to retain and increase the utilization of our services by these customers  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in entering into additional strategic relationships  or that any additional relationships  if entered into  will be on terms favorable to us 
our receipt of revenues from our strategic relationships is directly affected by the levels of effort of these distributors 
we cannot assure you that our strategic distributors will devote the resources necessary to successfully market our services 
each of these distributors offers services  either of their own or from our competitors  which are in one or more respects competitive with our service offerings 
in addition  our strategic distributors have the right to terminate their agreements with us under various specified circumstances  in some circumstances on short notice 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these agreements when they expire on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to maintain our existing strategic relationships or to enter into new strategic relationships  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
multex 
com s business would be materially and adversely affected if multex 
com is not successful in establishing brand awareness for multex investor the future success of multex investor will depend  in part  on our ability to increase its brand awareness 
in order to build our brand awareness we must succeed in our marketing efforts  provide high quality services and increase traffic to the multex investor web site 
we intend to increase our marketing budget substantially as part of our brand building efforts 
our ability to increase advertising and sponsorship revenue from multex investor will depend in part on our ability to increase the number of users of our web sites 
if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful or if we cannot increase our brand awareness  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
multex 
com s business could be materially and adversely affected by increased competition the market for the distribution of investment research and other information over the internet is intensely competitive 
we expect competition to continue to increase because our market poses no substantial barriers to entry 
competition also may increase as a result of industry consolidation 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which would have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
other companies provide and distribute investment research we face direct and indirect competition for both providers of investment research and other reports  and for subscribers  with the following types of companies 
large and well established distributors of financial information  including thomson financial services  through its subsidiaries first call and investext  and institutional brokers estimate system  a subsidiary of primark corp  
companies that provide investment research  including investment banks and brokerage firms  many of whom have their own web sites  
other providers of either free or subscription research services on the internet  
services provided by some of our strategic distributors which are competitive in one or more respects with our service offerings  
numerous prospective competitors  including standard poor s  moody s and zacks investment research  that offer investment research based services  
various written publications  including traditional media  investment newsletters  personal financial magazines and industry research appearing in financial periodicals  and 
services provided by in house management information services personnel and independent systems integrators 
various public sources provide extensive company information for free we also face competition due to the fact that extensive company specific information  as well as general investment research relating to particular industries  may be obtained  frequently without charge  from various public sources  including 
annual reports and other filings with the securities and exchange commission  
standard poor s company specific reports  and 
value line investment research reports 
these reports are all available from public libraries and from the companies about which these reports relate 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend upon many factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include our ability to sustain our relationships with leading providers of investment research  the timing and market acceptance of new services and enhancements to existing services developed by us and our competitors  ease of use  performance  price  reliability  customer service and support  and sales and marketing efforts 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of services offered 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
this may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in investor requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their services than we can 
our competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential employees  subscribers  strategic partners and information providers 
our competitors may develop services that are equal or superior to the services offered by us or that achieve greater market acceptance than our services do 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to improve their ability to address the needs of our existing and prospective customers 
as a result  it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
multex 
com has a high level of customer concentration and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were to lose a major subscriber or distributor historically  a few of our subscribers and distributors have accounted for a substantial majority of our revenues 
specifically  of our revenues in the year ended december  were generated from merrill lynch co 
the loss of any major subscriber or distributor  or any reduction or delay in subscriptions by any subscriber or distributor  or our failure to successfully market our services to new subscribers or distributors could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
multex 
com s business could be materially and adversely affected by a downturn in the financial services industry we are dependent upon the continued demand for the distribution of investment research and other information over the internet  making our business susceptible to a downturn in the financial services industry 
for example  a decrease in the number of analysts that prepare investment research reports or in the capital dedicated to the dissemination of this research could result in a decrease in the number of research reports and other financial information available for distribution and a concomitant decrease in demand by our subscribers for these reports and other information 
in addition  us financial institutions are continuing to consolidate  increasing the leverage of our information providers to negotiate price and decreasing the overall potential market for some of our services 
these factors  as well as other changes occurring in the financial services industry  could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
rapid growth in multex 
com s future operations could strain our managerial  operational and financial resources we have experienced rapid growth in our operations 
at december   we had a total of employees  as compared to employees at december  we expect that the number of our employees will continue to increase for the foreseeable future 
this rapid growth has placed  and our anticipated future growth will continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
as a result  we will need to continue to improve our operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures 
in addition  our future success will also depend on our ability to expand  train and manage our workforce  in particular our sales and marketing organization  both domestically and internationally 
we will also have to maintain close coordination among our technical  accounting  finance  marketing  sales and editorial personnel 
if we are unable to accomplish any of these objectives  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the loss of any of multex 
com s key personnel could have a material and adverse effect our future success will depend  in substantial part  on the continued service of our senior management  including mr 
isaak karaev  our chairman and chief executive officer  and key technical and sales personnel  none of whom has entered into an employment agreement with us other than a non competition non disclosure agreement 
we maintain a key person life insurance policy in the amount of million on the life of mr 
karaev 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our future success will also depend on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical  sales and marketing  customer support  financial and accounting  and managerial personnel 
competition for this personnel  in particular information technology professionals  is intense  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we will be able to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
multex 
com s international operations are new and may not be successful 
we have only limited business experience outside of the united states we have only recently commenced operations in a number of international markets and a key component of our strategy is to continue to expand our international operations 
to date  we have only limited experience in developing and obtaining research and other financial information relating to companies whose securities are traded on foreign markets and in marketing  selling and distributing our services internationally 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully market  sell and deliver our services in these markets 
in some markets  including hong kong  we intend to rely on the sales and marketing efforts of independent representatives 
the failure of our independent representatives to successfully solicit information providers or market our services in these markets could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
doing business internationally subjects us to additional regulatory requirements  tax liabilities and other risks there are risks inherent in doing business in international markets  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  potentially adverse tax consequences  export restrictions and controls  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and various other parts of the world  any of which could have a material and adverse effect on the success of our international operations and  consequently  on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that governmental regulatory agencies in one or more foreign countries will not determine that the services provided by us constitute the provision of investment advice  which could result in our having to register in these countries as an investment advisor or in our having to cease selling our services in these countries  either of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if multex 
com cannot keep pace with the evolving standards of the industry and demands of customers  we may be unable to enhance our existing services or introduce new services the market in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new service announcements  introductions and enhancements  and evolving customer demands 
these market characteristics are exacerbated by the emerging nature of the internet and the electronic distribution of investment research 
accordingly  our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and industry standards  and our ability to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our services in response to both evolving customer demands and competitive service offerings 
our inability to successfully adapt to these changes in a timely manner could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design  development  testing  introduction or marketing of new services  or that any enhancements to existing services will adequately meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and achieve any degree of significant market acceptance 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new services or enhancements to existing services in a timely manner or in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  or if our services or enhancements contain defects or do not achieve a significant degree of market acceptance  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
because multex 
com s business is dependent upon network and computer systems located in one area  we are particularly susceptible to problems caused by natural disasters  power failures  system failures  security breaches or other damage to our system our electronic distribution of investment research utilizes proprietary technology which resides principally in new york city 
the continued and uninterrupted performance of our network and computer systems is critical to our success 
any disaster  power outage or system failure that causes interruptions in our ability to provide our services to our customers  including failures that affect our ability to collect research from our information providers or provide electronic investment research to our users  could reduce customer satisfaction and  if sustained or repeated  would reduce the attractiveness of our services 
an increase in the volume of research reports handled by our systems  or in the rate of requests for this research  could strain the capacity of our software or hardware  which could lead to slower response times or system failures 
furthermore  we face the risk of a security breach of our systems that could disrupt the distribution of research and other reports and information 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if any of these problems occur 
our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our network and computer systems against damage from computer viruses  fire  power loss  data communications failures  vandalism and other malicious acts  and similar unexpected adverse events 
in addition  a failure of our communications providers to provide the data communications capacity in the time frame required by us for any reason could cause interruptions in the delivery of our services 
despite precautions we have taken  unanticipated problems affecting our systems have from time to time in the past caused  and in the future could cause  delays and interruptions in the delivery of our services 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover any claims by dissatisfied providers or subscribers or may not be adequate to indemnify us for any liability that may be imposed in the event that a claim were brought against us 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any system failure  security breach or other damage that interrupts or delays our operations 
if multex 
com fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights or faces a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party  it could lose its intellectual property rights or be liable for significant damages our future success will depend  in substantial part  on our intellectual property rights 
we seek to protect our intellectual property rights  but these actions may be inadequate to protect the rights covered by our patents  patent applications  trademarks or other proprietary rights or to prevent others from claiming violations of their proprietary rights 
our intellectual proprietary rights may not be viable or of value in the future since the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related industries is uncertain and still evolving 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that third parties will not claim that we have infringed their patents or other proprietary rights 
from time to time we have been  and we expect to continue to be  subject to claims by third parties in the ordinary course of our business  including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other proprietary rights of third parties 
although there has not been any litigation relating to these claims to date  these claims and any resultant litigation  should they occur  could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in the invalidation of our proprietary rights 
in addition  even if we prevail  this litigation could be time consuming and expensive to defend  and could result in the diversion of our time and attention  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
any claims or litigation from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the trademarks and other intellectual property subject to these claims or litigation unless we enter into agreements with the third parties responsible for these claims or litigation which may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms 
generally  we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary information from unauthorized use or disclosure  parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our proprietary information which  if successful  could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
the market price of our shares may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of internet related companies have been especially volatile  including fluctuations that are often unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
broad market fluctuations of this type may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including 
public announcements concerning us or our competitors  or the internet industry  
fluctuations in operating results  
a downturn in the financial services industry generally or the market for securities trading in particular  
introductions of new products or services by us or our competitors  
changes in analysts earnings estimates  and 
announcements of technological innovations 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
our executive officers  directors and or greater stockholders significantly influence all matters requiring a stockholder vote our executive officers  directors and existing stockholders who each own greater than of the outstanding common stock and their affiliates  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  our executive officers  directors and or greater stockholders will be able to significantly influence the outcome of all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
a third party could be prevented from acquiring your shares of stock at a premium to the market price because of our anti takeover provisions various provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so might be beneficial to you and our other stockholders 
the future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options and a warrant in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of multex 
com include individuals or entities that control  are controlled by  or are under common control of multex 
com and may include some of the officers  directors  or principal shareholders of multex 
com 
affiliates may not sell their shares of multex 
com common stock except pursuant to 
an effective registration statement under the securities act covering the resale of those shares  
an exemption under rule under the securities act  or 
another applicable exemption under the securities act 
risks related to the internet industry if internet usage does not continue to grow  the our business may not be successful the internet is relatively new and is rapidly evolving 
the multex 
com s business would be materially and adversely affected if internet usage does not continue to grow 
internet usage may be inhibited for a number of reasons  including 
the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it or its performance and reliability may decline as usage grows  
security and authentication concerns with respect to transmission over the internet of confidential information  including credit card numbers  and attempts by unauthorized computer users to penetrate our network security  and 
privacy concerns  including those related to the placement by web sites of information on a user s hard drive without the user s knowledge or consent in order to gather user information 
our markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product and service introductions  and changing customer demands 
to be successful  we must adapt to our rapidly changing markets by continually enhancing our existing services and adding new services to address our customers changing demands 
we could incur substantial costs if we need to modify our services or infrastructure in order to adapt to these changes 
our business  results of operation and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected if we incurred significant costs without generating additional revenues or if we cannot rapidly adapt to these changes 
if the internet infrastructure is not adequately maintained  we may be unable to provide investment research and information services in a timely manner our future success will depend  in substantial part  upon the maintenance of the internet infrastructure  including a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  and the timely development of enabling products  including high speed modems  for providing reliability and timely internet access and services 
to the extent that the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users  frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements of users  we cannot assure you that the internet infrastructure will continue to be able to support the demands placed on it or that the performance or reliability of the internet will not be adversely affected 
furthermore  the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure or otherwise  and these outages or delays could adversely affect the web sites of our contributors  subscribers or distributors 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability as a form of media due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols that can handle increased levels of activity 
we cannot assure you that the infrastructure and complementary products and services necessary to maintain the internet as a viable commercial medium will be developed or maintained 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including security  cost  ease of use and access  intellectual property ownership and other legal liability issues  remain unresolved and could materially and adversely affect both the growth of internet usage generally and our business  results of operations and financial condition in particular 
we may be subject to legal claims in connection with the content we publish and distribute on the internet as a publisher and distributor of online content  we face potential direct and indirect liability for claims of defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement  violation of the securities laws and other claims based upon the reports and data that we publish 
for example  by distributing a negative investment research report  we may find ourselves subject to defamation claims  regardless of the merits of these claims 
computer failures may also result in incorrect data being published and distributed widely 
in these and other instances  we may be required to engage in protracted and expensive litigation  which could have the effect of diverting management s attention and require us to expend significant financial resources 
our general liability insurance may not necessarily cover any of these claims or may not be adequate to protect us against all liability that may be imposed 
any claims or resulting litigation could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may become subject to burdensome government regulation and legal uncertainties the laws governing the internet remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws  including those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation  apply to the internet generally and the electronic distribution of investment research in particular 
legislation could dampen the growth in the use of the internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications and commercial medium  which could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  because the growing popularity and use of the internet has burdened the existing telecommunications infrastructure and many areas with high internet usage have begun to experience interruptions in phone service  some local telephone carriers have petitioned governmental agencies to regulate internet service providers and online service providers in a manner similar to long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on internet service providers and online service providers 
if any of these petitions or the relief that they seek is granted  the costs of communicating on the internet could increase substantially  potentially adversely affecting the growth in the use of the internet 
further  due to the global nature of the internet  it is possible that  although transmissions relating to our services originate in the state of new york  governments of other states  the united states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate our services or levy sales or other taxes on our activities 
we cannot assure you that violations of local or other laws will not be alleged or charged by local  state  federal or foreign governments  that we might not unintentionally violate these laws or that these laws will not be modified  or new laws enacted  in the future 
any of these developments could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition
