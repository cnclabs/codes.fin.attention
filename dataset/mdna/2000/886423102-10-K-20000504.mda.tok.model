item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company provides services and equipment to the international offshore energy industry through the operation of a diversified fleet of marine service vessels 
revenues  net earnings and cash flows from operations are dependent upon the activity level of the vessel fleet which is ultimately dependent upon oil and natural gas prices which  in turn  are determined by the supply demand relationship for oil and natural gas 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
acquisitions and dispositions in order to better meet and service the needs of its customers  the company announced on january  a new build program estimated to cost in the range of million 
the vessels  which will be designed to cover operational capabilities the company currently does not possess  will include very large anchor handling towing supply vessels and large platform supply vessels capable of working in most of the deepwater markets of the world 
the company expects to finance the new build program from its current cash balances that exceed million at march   its projected cash flow and its existing million revolving credit facility 
deliveries on the new vessels are expected to commence in about two years 
during the quarter ended september  the company acquired six new build vessels for an aggregate cash payment of approximately million from an industry competitor 
the package of vessels included one supply vessel  two offshore tugs and three crew boats 
all six vessels were delivered to the market during fiscal in july the company sold all of its safety standby vessels for approximately million in an all cash transaction 
the specialized fleet was sold because it did not conform to the company s long range strategies 
on february  the company completed the sale of its compression division 
in consideration of the sale  the company received cash of approximately million 
on may  the company acquired all of the shares of oil ltd 
oil the total cost of the acquisition of million was allocated under the purchase method of accounting based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  plus amounts for professional fees  severance and other transaction costs and the related deferred tax effect of the acquisition 
prior to the purchase oil was principally engaged in the business of operating approximately marine vessels  primarily platform supply and anchor handling towing supply vessels  in several offshore oil and gas exploration areas outside of the united states 
goodwill of approximately million was recorded and is being amortized over years 
to finance the oil acquisition million of debt was incurred pursuant to a million revolving credit and term loan agreement with several banks and consisted of a million term loan and million borrowed under the million revolving credit facility of the agreement 
at march  all debt borrowed to finance the oil acquisition had been repaid and the million term loan facility canceled 
on june  the company acquired the remaining equity interest in nine towing supply and supply vessels previously owned and operated by joint venture companies in australia for a cash payment of million and issuance of debt totaling million 
the total cost of the acquisition of million was allocated under the purchase method of accounting based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  plus amounts for professional fees  severance and other transaction costs and the related deferred tax effect of the acquisition 
goodwill of approximately million was recorded and is being amortized over years 
general market conditions fiscal results of operations continued to experience the effects of the curtailment in capital spending in the oil industry as a result of the drop in oil prices that commenced in the fall of although oil prices increased substantially throughout and into  capital spending levels of oil and gas exploration and production companies continue to be below levels 
us based vessel activity weakened throughout fiscal and stabilized during the first quarter of fiscal  domestic vessel demand has recovered gradually throughout the remainder of fiscal the oil industry downturn immediately affected the us gulf of mexico vessel market as the duration of vessel contracts in this region normally range from one to three months 
us based vessel revenues for the current fiscal year have declined approximately and compared to fiscal and  respectively  due to lower utilization and average day rates 
as of march   the towing supply supply vessels operating in the us gulf of mexico are experiencing approximately utilization and average day rates of approximately  per day compared to utilization and average day rates of approximately  per day at march  toward the latter part of fiscal us based towing supply supply vessels were experiencing utilization and average day rates close to  per day 
oil prices have appreciated significantly during calendar year and during the same period natural gas prices have trended upwards also 
the increases in the pricing of oil and gas combined with a tightening of inventory levels have increased the demand for working drilling rigs and services 
despite the improvements in the prices of oil and gas and increases in the active rig count  the industry has not yet rebounded in full from the sharp decline experienced during fiscal in addition  the delivery of a number of newly constructed supply vessels to various industry competitors during fiscal has negatively affected the supply and demand balance for supply vessels in the gulf of mexico and some international markets  thereby putting continued downward pressure on vessel utilization and day rates 
fiscal international vessel revenues decreased and compared to fiscal and  respectively  due to lower utilization and average day rates as a result of the slow down in the oil industry 
fiscal international activity was not as dramatically affected by the downturn in the oil industry as was domestic vessel activity due primarily to the longer term nature of international vessel contracts 
fiscal revenues increased over fiscal at march   the towing supply supply vessels operating in the international areas are experiencing approximately utilization and average day rates of approximately  compared to utilization and average day rates of approximately  per day at march  utilization and average day rates for the international based towing supply supply vessels were and  respectively  at march  international based vessel demand weakened sharply during the fourth quarter of fiscal  but has shown signs of stabilization during the third quarter of fiscal in response to the oil industry downturn the following actions have been taken 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company began stacking those vessels that could not find gainful employment 
drydockings associated with the stacked vessels have been deferred thus substantially reducing repair and maintenance costs for fiscal reductions in crew personnel were made  consequently lowering crew costs for fiscal the company sold its safety standby vessel fleet in july as it did not conform to the company s long range strategies 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  older  little used vessels were withdrawn from active service at which time they were removed from the utilization statistics 
fourteen of the vessels were withdrawn from the domestic market and were withdrawn from the international market 
vessel utilization rates are a function of vessel days worked and vessel days available for active vessels only 
the removal of vessels from active service decreased the number of vessel days available which consequently increased vessel utilization rates during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal vessels withdrawn from active service are intended to be sold 
the company continues to dispose of its older vessels out of the active fleet and the withdrawn fleet that are not marketable due to obsolescence or are economically prohibitive to operate due to high repair costs 
due to the oil industry downturn and having stacked and removed several vessels from the active fleet during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company conducted a review of the recoverability of the values of certain vessels 
in march  the company recorded a write down of million to reduce the carrying value of certain vessels 
earnings overview earnings from continuing operations decreased and below fiscal and amounts  respectively  after eliminating the effects of unusual items 
fiscal earnings from continued operations included the following unusual item a million  or 
per common share  reduction in income tax expense from the reversal of previously provided taxes resulting from the settlement of open income tax audits 
fiscal earnings from continuing operations included the following unusual items a million  or 
per common share  after tax write down on certain vessels as previously discussed  and a million  or 
per common share  reduction in income tax expense 
the reduction in income tax expense consisted of a million reduction of deferred income taxes resulting from the lowering of united kingdom corporate income tax rates and a million realization of foreign tax credits not previously recognized resulting from a tax planning strategy of selling certain vessels from one taxing jurisdiction to another through intercompany sales 
the result of such sales was to pay foreign taxes which are fully creditable on a current basis against us income taxes and the release of previously accrued deferred foreign tax credits 
fiscal earnings from continuing operations included the following unusual items a million  or 
per common share  after tax provision for possible litigation expenses  a 
million  or 
per common share  after tax gain from the settlement of obligations resulting from the fiscal curtailment of the company s pension plan  and a million  or 
per common share  reduction in income tax expense 
the reduction in income tax expense consisted of a million reduction of deferred income taxes resulting from the lowering of united kingdom corporate income tax rates and a million reduction in a previously established liability for contested us income tax issues 
marine operations offshore service vessels provide a diverse range of services and equipment to the energy industry 
fleet size  utilization and vessel day rates primarily determine the amount of revenues and operating profit because operating costs and depreciation do not change proportionally when revenue changes 
operating costs primarily consist of crew costs  repair and maintenance  insurance  fuel  lube oil and supplies 
fleet size and utilization are the major factors which affect crew costs 
the timing and amount of repair and maintenance costs are influenced by vessel age and scheduled drydockings to satisfy safety and inspection requirements mandated by regulatory agencies 
whenever possible  vessel drydockings are done during seasonally slow periods to minimize any impact on vessel operations and are only done if economically justified  given the vessel s age and physical condition 
the following table compares revenues and operating expenses excluding general and administrative expenses and depreciation expense for the company s vessel fleet for the years ended march vessel revenues and operating costs relate to vessels owned and operated by the company  while other marine services relate to third party activities of the company s shipyards  brokered vessels and other miscellaneous marine related activities

marine operating profit and other components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended march consists of the following in thousands vessel activity united states    international    gain on sales of assets    other marine services    operating profit    other income    other expense  corporate expenses    interest and other debt costs   earnings from continuing operations before income taxes    operating profit for fiscal decreased and as compared to fiscal and  respectively  due to declines in utilization and average day rates for both us based vessels and international based vessels and a decrease in the total number of vessels operating worldwide 
utilization and average day rates for both us based vessels and international based vessels declined in the current fiscal year as a result of reductions in customer drilling programs due to the downturn in the oil industry 
decreases in operating profit were partially offset by higher gains on asset sales 
included in fiscal gain on sales of assets is a fourth quarter write down of million to reduce the carrying value of certain vessels 
the write down resulted from a review of the recoverability of the values of certain vessels 
the review was performed due to industry conditions and having stacked and withdrawn from the active fleet several vessels at march  operating profit for fiscal year decreased as compared to fiscal due to declines in utilization and average day rates for us based vessels  a decrease in the number of us based vessels and lower gains on asset sales 
these decreases were somewhat offset by an increase in average day rates for international based vessels 
the number of us based vessels decreased primarily because of vessels being withdrawn from active service along with some movement of vessels to international locations 
utilization and average day rates for us based vessels declined in fiscal as a result of reductions in customer drilling programs consequently decreasing us based vessel operating profit by approximately 
better market conditions in certain international locations throughout most of fiscal resulted in higher average day rates for international based vessels as compared to fiscal fiscal s operating profit was the highest in the company s history as a result of higher average day rates for the worldwide vessel fleet  a larger international based vessel fleet and high gains from asset sales  partially offset by higher operating costs 
higher average day rates for the worldwide vessel fleet resulted from a favorable supply demand relationship for company services both in the us gulf of mexico and internationally 
higher fiscal operating costs resulted from the expansion of the international based vessel fleet through the purchase of the oil and australian vessels  increased costs associated with attracting  training and retaining qualified vessel personnel  and a greater number of vessel drydockings 
gains on asset sales were high in fiscal as a result of the disposal of several vessels  most of which had previously been withdrawn from active service due to obsolescence and prohibitive repair costs 
as a result of the uncertainty of a certain customer to make payment of vessel charter hire  the company has deferred the recognition of approximately million of billings as of march  and million of billings as of march  which would otherwise have been recognized as revenue 
the company will recognize the amounts as revenue as cash is collected or at such time as the uncertainty has been reduced 
fiscal other expense of million consists of an million provision for litigation costs resulting from certain alleged labor law pay violations in various areas of the world where marine vessel operations are conducted  and a million gain from the settlement of obligations resulting from the fiscal curtailment of the company s pension plan 
at march   million has been paid in settlements relating to these alleged labor law pay violations 
vessel utilization is determined primarily by market conditions and to a lesser extent by drydocking requirements 
vessel day rates are determined by the demand created through the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy companies relative to the supply of offshore service vessels 
suitability of equipment and the degree of service provided also influence vessel day rates

liquidity  capital resources and other matters the company s current ratio  level of working capital and amount of cash flows from continuing operations for any year are directly related to fleet activity and vessel day rates 
variations from year to year in these items are primarily the result of market conditions 
cash from ongoing operations in combination with an available line of credit provide the company  in management s opinion  with adequate resources to satisfy financing requirements 
at march   all of the company s million revolving line of credit was available for future financing needs 
continued payment of dividends  most recently 
per quarter per common share  is subject to declaration by the board of directors 
in order to better meet and service the needs of its customers  the company announced on january  a new build program estimated to cost in the range of million 
the vessels  which will be designed to cover operational capabilities the company currently does not possess  will include very large anchor handling towing supply vessels and large platform supply vessels capable of working in most of the deepwater markets of the world 
the company expects to finance the new build program from its current cash balances that exceed million at march   its projected cash flow and its existing million revolving credit facility 
deliveries on the new vessels are expected to commence in about two years 
at march   no commitments to shipyards or other suppliers had been made for construction of these vessels 
investing activities for fiscal provided cash of approximately million 
proceeds from the sale of assets totaling million were higher in fiscal than fiscal and due to a greater number of vessels being sold  primarily the safety standby vessels which were sold in july for approximately million in an all cash transaction 
excluding the oil and australian acquisitions  additions to properties and equipment were higher in fiscal than fiscal and due to a greater amount of vessel acquisitions 
additions to properties and equipment in fiscal totaled million of which million related to capitalized repairs and maintenance and million in new vessels construction 
the new construction includes approximately million for the purchase of six new build vessels from an industry competitor 
fiscal financing activities used million of cash for payment of quarterly common stock dividends 
fiscal financing activities used million of cash which included million prepayment on the credit facility and repayment of million of debt incurred from the australian acquisitions 
in addition million was borrowed primarily for income tax payments of which approximately million related to the sale of the compression division 
the company purchased  shares of common stock during fiscal year at an aggregate cost of million including broker commissions and fees 
fiscal financing activities included scheduled principal payments on long term debt of million  million of prepayments on the credit facility  and the repayment of million of debt assumed from the oil and australian acquisitions 
the company purchased  shares of common stock during the year ended march  at an aggregate cost of million 
goodwill at march  the company had goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  which represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
the goodwill amount primarily relates to the oil acquisition made during fiscal and is being amortized over years 
in assigning such amortization period the company considered many factors  including the projected future cash flows of the acquired business and the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors that may reduce a useful life 
management periodically reviews goodwill to assess recoverability and impairments would be recognized in operating results if a permanent diminution in value were to occur 
at march  management determined that there is no persuasive evidence that any material portion of goodwill will dissipate over a shorter period than the amortization period used 
new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value  and is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
 as amended  will have a material impact on its financial statements 
currency fluctuations and inflation because of its significant international operations  the company is exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange risk 
to minimize the financial impact of these items the company attempts to contract a majority of its services in united states dollars 
day to day operating costs are generally affected by inflation 
however  because the energy services industry requires specialized goods and services  general economic inflationary trends may not affect the company s operating costs 
the major impact on operating costs is the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy exploration and production companies 
as this spending increases  prices of goods and services used by the energy industry and the energy services industry will increase 
future increases in vessel day rates may shield the company from the inflationary effects on operating costs 
environmental matters during the ordinary course of business the company s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations 
the company attempts to comply with these laws and regulations in order to avoid costly accidents and related environmental damage 
compliance with existing governmental regulations which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  has not had  nor is expected to have  a material effect on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at march  the company had no debt or derivative financial instruments outstanding 
the company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and exchange risks but attempts to minimize the financial impact of these items by contracting the majority of its services in united states dollars 
in addition  the company attempts to manage its foreign currency assets and liabilities in order to minimize its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations
