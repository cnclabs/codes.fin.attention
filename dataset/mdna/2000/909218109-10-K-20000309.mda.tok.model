item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and liquidity our bank loan agreement provides for a total loan facility of million with a current available borrowing value of million 
each year on april and october our banks redetermine our available borrowing value which is an amount equal to a percentage of the discounted future value of our oil and natural gas reserves plus an amount which is the greater of i percent of the appraised value of our contract drilling rigs or ii two times the previous months cash flow from our contract drilling rigs  limited  in either case  to million 
our loan agreement provides for a revolving credit facility which terminates on may  followed by a three year term loan 
borrowings under our loan agreement totaled million at december  and million at february  we are charged a facility fee of 
of percent on any unused portion of the available borrowing value 
the loan agreement also contains covenants which require us to maintain 
consolidated tangible net worth of at least million  
a current ratio of not less than to  
a ratio of long term debt  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to  
a ratio of total liabilities  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to  and 
working capital provided by operations  as defined in the loan agreement  cannot be less than million in any year 
the interest rate on our bank debt was percent at december  and percent at february  at our election  any portion of our outstanding bank debt may be fixed at the london interbank offered rate libor rate  as adjusted depending on the level of our debt as a percentage of the available borrowing value 
the libor rate may be fixed for periods of up to   or days with the remainder of our bank debt being subject to the chase manhattan bank  n 
a 
prime rate 
during any libor rate funding period  we may not pay any part of the outstanding principal balance which is subject to the libor rate 
borrowings subject to the libor rate were million at both december  and february our shareholders equity at december  was million giving us a ratio of long term debt to total capitalization of percent 
our primary source of funds consists of the cash flow from our operating activities and borrowings under our bank loan agreement 
net cash provided by our operating activities in was million compared to million in we had working capital of million at december  our total capital expenditures were million of which million was spent on our oil and natural gas operations  million for exploration and development drilling and million for producing property acquisitions  and million on our contract drilling operations 
capital expenditures for our contract drilling operations consisted primarily of million to acquire the parker land drilling rigs with the rest for major components on our rig fleet 
we anticipate that we will spend approximately million in for drilling rig equipment capital expenditures 
as natural gas and oil prices increased during the last six months of  we increased our development drilling activity with the result that we drilled wells during the fourth quarter as compared to a total of wells during the first three quarters of if oil and natural gas prices remain favorable  we anticipate that we may spend approximately million drilling or buying oil and natural gas properties in most of our capital expenditures are discretionary and directed toward increasing oil and natural gas reserves and future growth 
current operations do not depend on our ability to obtain funds outside of our loan agreement 
future decisions to acquire or drill on oil and natural gas properties will depend on prevailing or anticipated market conditions  potential return on investment  future drilling potential and the availability of opportunities to obtain financing under the circumstances involved  thus providing us with a large degree of flexibility in determining when and if to incur such costs 
on december   we signed an agreement and plan of merger with questa oil and gas co 
questa under which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries will be merged the merger with questa 
questa will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
in the merger each of questa s outstanding shares of common stock excluding treasury shares will be converted into the right to receive 
shares of our common stock 
questa has million shares outstanding 
we anticipate that this merger  which is subject to a number of conditions  will close late in the first quarter of and will be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on september   we completed the acquisition of land drilling rigs from parker drilling company and parker drilling company north america  inc  for  shares of our common stock and  in cash 
the cash part of this acquisition was funded through a public offering of  shares of our common stock which closed on september  we received proceeds of million from the offering net of commission fees and other costs 
on november   we acquired hickman drilling company pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger entered into by and between us  hickman drilling company and all of the holders of the outstanding capital stock of hickman drilling company 
as part of this acquisition  the former shareholders of hickman held  as of december   promissory notes in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of million 
these notes are payable in equal annual installments on january  through january  the notes bear interest at the chase prime rate which at december  was percent and february  was percent 
at february   the promissory notes outstanding totaled million 
due to a settlement agreement which terminated at december   we have a liability of million at december   representing proceeds received from a natural gas purchaser as prepayment for natural gas 
the million is payable in equal annual payments from june  to june  the prices we received for our oil in increased throughout the year ending percent higher than the prices we received during february  when oil prices were at their lowest for the year 
while oil prices steadily increased during the year  natural gas prices were volatile 
our average natural gas price in december as compared to january was percent higher but dropped percent in one month from november to december for the year  the average natural gas price we received was per mcf and the average oil price we received was per barrel 
natural gas prices are influenced by weather conditions and supply imbalances  particularly in the domestic market  and by world wide oil price levels 
domestic oil price levels continue to be primarily influenced by world market developments 
since natural gas comprises approximately percent of our total oil and natural gas reserves  large drops in spot market natural gas prices have a significant adverse effect on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves and price declines could cause us to reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
any price decreases  if sustained  would also adversely affect our future cash flow by reducing our oil and natural gas revenues and  if continued over an extended period  could lessen not only the demand for our contract drilling rigs but also the rate we would receive 
any declines in natural gas and oil prices could also adversely affect the semi annual determination of the loan value under our bank loan agreement since this determination is based on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves and our drilling rigs 
such a reduction would reduce the amount available to us under our loan agreement which  in turn  would affect our ability to carry out our capital projects 
generally  during the past years  our contract drilling operations have encountered significant competition although in the last six months of  all of and the first nine months of we experienced significant improvement in rig utilization 
however  in late and through the first six months of we  along with the drilling industry as a whole  experienced a significant reduction in demand for our drilling rigs 
while we experienced an increase in demand during the last six months of  we anticipate that competition within our industry will  for the foreseeable future  continue to influence the use of our drilling rigs 
in addition to competition  our ability to use our drilling rigs at any given time depends on a number of other factors  including the price of both oil and natural gas  the availability of labor and our ability to supply the type of equipment required 
we expect these factors will also continue to influence the use of our rigs in at december   we had tax net operating loss carryforwards nol s of approximately million  the benefit of which has been recognized in our financial statements as we believe it to be more likely than not that these nol s will be utilized by us 
approximately million of the nol s expire in and approximately million expire in should we be unable to generate sufficient income in these years to allow the utilization of the nol s  a charge to expense will be required to give recognition to any loss of the nol s 
in the third quarter of  our board of directors authorized us to purchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock on the open market 
since that time   shares have been repurchased at prices ranging from to per share 
in the first quarter of  and  we used   and  of the purchased shares  respectively  as our matching contribution to our k employee thrift plan 
at december  we held no treasury shares 
year statement we spent approximately  to make our software and hardware compliant for the transition into the year we have not experienced any material problems during the transition into the new year and have not received reports of any material problems from any of our suppliers or customers 
effects of inflation in previous years the effects of inflation on our operations have been minimal due to low inflation rates 
however  during the last six months of  throughout and in the last half of  as drilling rig day rates and drilling rig utilization increased  the impact of inflation increased as the availability of equipment  third party services and qualified labor decreased 
how inflation will effect us in the future will depend on the increase  if any  we realize in our drilling rig rates and the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas 
if industry activity suddenly and substantially increases  shortages in support equipment such as drill pipe  third party services and qualified labor could occur resulting in additional corresponding increases in our material and labor costs 
these conditions may limit our ability to realize improvements in operating profits 
new accounting pronouncement on june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
in june  fas was amended by fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas is now effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  january  for unit 
fas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
we anticipate that  based on the nature of our use of derivative instruments  the adoption of fas will not have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
results of operations versus net income for was  compared with  in lower natural gas and oil prices in the first half of reduced both the demand for our drilling rigs and the rates we received for the drilling rigs that were operating 
our oil and natural gas revenues increased percent in due to a percent and percent increase in the average prices we received for natural gas and oil  respectively 
for the year  natural gas production decreased by percent and oil production decreased by percent when compared to our oil production is declining because we have emphasized in recent years the drilling of development wells aimed at replacing and increasing our natural gas reserves 
our natural gas production decreased because we curtailed our development drilling program during the first half of while oil and natural gas prices were depressed 
as prices began to improve during the last six months of  our natural gas production increased as we increased our drilling program 
natural gas production for the fourth quarter of exceeded s fourth quarter production by percent 
in  revenues from our contract drilling operations increased by percent as the average number of drilling rigs being used increased from in to in revenues per rig per day increased percent between the comparative years 
during the first nine months of as compared to the same period of  our average drilling rig utilization was down percent and our average revenues per rig day was down percent 
the acquisition of the parker drilling rigs added rigs to our utilization rate in the fourth quarter of at dayrates substantially higher than those achieved in our other marketing area 
as a result  that acquisition had a strong impact on our contract drilling fourth quarter and year end operating results  adding million in revenues 
daywork revenues represented percent of our total drilling revenues in and percent in operating margins revenues less operating costs for our oil and natural gas operations were percent in and percent in this increase resulted primarily from the increase in the average oil and natural gas prices we received and a percent decrease in operating costs between the comparative years 
our contract drilling operating margins decreased from percent in to percent in this reduction was generally due to decreases during the first nine months of in both daily drilling rig revenue rates and utilization and increases in operating costs 
total contract drilling operating costs were up percent in versus due to increased labor costs and related benefit costs  including workers compensation 
contract drilling depreciation increased percent due to the impact of higher depreciation per operating day associated with the newly acquired parker rigs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of our oil and natural gas properties increased percent as the average dd a rate per mcfe increased percent to in the dd a rate increase was partially offset by the previously discussed decrease in production 
general and administrative expenses increased percent as certain employee benefit costs and outside services increased 
interest expense increased percent as our average outstanding debt increased percent during the average interest rate decreased from percent in to percent in on may   our contract drilling offices in moore  oklahoma were struck by a tornado destroying two buildings and damaging various vehicles and drilling equipment 
in may  we received  of insurance proceeds for the destroyed buildings  and as a result  in the second quarter of  we recognized a gain of  recorded as part of other revenues 
other claims for the contents of the two buildings and damaged equipment and damage removal covered under other insurance policies have been filed 
we do not expect any financial loss to be incurred from these claims 
versus net income for was  compared with  in increases in the number of rigs utilized and increased natural gas production were more than offset by substantial decreases in the average price received for both oil and natural gas and to a lesser extent from reduced oil production and contract drilling rates 
oil and natural gas revenues decreased percent in due to a percent and percent decrease in average natural gas and oil prices received  respectively along with a percent reduction in oil production 
these decreases were partially offset by a percent increase in natural gas production 
oil production declined from levels due to our emphasis over the past three years in drilling development wells which focused on replacing and increasing natural gas reserves 
average natural gas spot market prices received by us decreased percent 
the natural gas previously subject to the settlement agreement  which ended at december  and contained provisions for prices higher than current spot market prices  is now being sold at spot market prices consistent with the rest of the natural gas sold by us 
the impact of higher prices received under the settlement agreement increased pre tax income by approximately  in in  revenues from contract drilling operations increased by percent as average rig utilization increased from rigs operating in to rigs operating in daywork revenues per rig per day decreased percent between the comparative years 
during the first three quarters of  our monthly rig utilization consistently remained at or above rigs with daywork revenue per rig per day declining by percent from the january rate 
in the fourth quarter utilization dropped percent from the previous quarter and dayrates decreased another percent 
total daywork revenues represented percent of total drilling revenues in and percent in turnkey and footage contracts typically provide for higher revenues since a greater portion of the expense of drilling the well is borne by the drilling contractor 
operating margins revenues less operating costs for our natural gas and oil operations were percent in compared to percent in decreased operating margins resulted primarily from the decrease in average natural gas and oil prices received by us between the two years 
total operating costs were percent higher in compared to as we continue to add producing properties 
operating margins for contract drilling decreased from percent in to percent in margins in were lower primarily due to decreases in both daily rig rates and utilization in the fourth quarter of total operating costs for contract drilling were up percent in versus due to increased drilling rig utilization and costs associated with the november hickman acquisition 
contract drilling depreciation increased percent in response to increased rig utilization and additional drilling capital expenditures throughout and depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of oil and natural gas properties increased percent as we increased our equivalent barrels of production by percent and our average dd a rate per mcfe increased percent to in general and administrative expenses increased percent as certain employee costs increased 
interest expense increased percent as our average outstanding debt increased percent during the average interest rate decreased from percent in to percent in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is in the pricing of our oil and natural gas production 
the price we receive is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and market prices applicable to our natural gas production 
historically  prices we have received for our oil and natural gas production have been volatile and such volatility is expected to continue 
to reduce the impact of price fluctuations  we periodically use hedging strategies to hedge the price we will receive for a portion of our future oil and natural gas production 
during six different months of we had swap transactions applying to approximately to percent of our daily gas production 
these transactions yielded a reduction in our natural gas revenues of  at december   we did not have any forward of future contracts relating to the production of our oil and natural gas 
in the first quarter of  we entered into swap transactions in an effort to lock in a portion of our production at the higher oil prices which currently exist 
these transactions apply to approximately percent of our daily natural gas production covering the period from april  to july  and percent of our oil production for august and september of  at prices ranging from to 
interest rate risk our interest rate exposure relates to our long term debt  all of which bears interest at variable rates based on the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor rate 
at our election  borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan may be fixed at the libor rate for periods up to days 
historically  we have not utilized any financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to attempt to manage the exposure to increases in interest rates 
however  we may consider the use of such financial instruments in the future based on our assessment of future interest rates 
the impact on annual cash flow before taxes of a one percent change in the floating rate bases on our average outstanding long term debt in would have been approximately
