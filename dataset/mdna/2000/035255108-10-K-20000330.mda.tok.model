year disclosure the term year issue is a general term used to describe various problems that may result from the improper processing by computer systems of dates after these problems arise from the inability of some hardware and software to distinguish dates before the year from the dates in and after the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
the year issue affects virtually all companies and all organizations 
the company s efforts to address its year issues prior to january   were focused in the following three areas i reviewing and taking any necessary steps to attempt to correct the company s computer information systems ie  software applications and hardware platforms  ii evaluating and making any necessary modifications to other computer systems that do not relate to information technology but include embedded technology  such as telecommunications  security  hvac  elevator  fire and safety systems  and iii communicating with certain significant third party service providers to determine whether there will be any interruption in their systems that could affect the company 
in october  the company implemented a new financial planning system to replace an older system that did not address the year issue 
the company has not experienced any business or service disruptions as a result of any year issues  nor has the company been contacted by any vendors or customers as to any year issues with respect to their various products or services 
costs incurred to date related to year issues were approximately  and have not been material  nor does the company expect to incur additional material costs related to year issues 
the company is continuing to evaluate potential disruptions or complications that might result in the future from year related problems  although at this time  the company has not identified any specific business functions that are likely to suffer material disruption as a result of year related issues 
due to the unique and pervasive nature of the year issue  however  it is not possible to anticipate each of the wide variety of year issues that might arise  particularly outside of the company  which might have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors and certain factors affecting future operating results comprehensive government regulation  no assurance of fda approval 
the company s products  product development activities  manufacturing processes  and current and future sales and marketing are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the marketing  advertising  promotion  and distribution of medical devices  drugs  and biologics  as well as testing  manufacturing  labeling  recordkeeping  and reporting activities for such products 
medical products regulated by the fda are generally classified as medical devices and or drugs and or biologics 
product development and approval within the fda framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
there can be no assurance that the fda will grant approval for the company s new products on a timely basis if at all  or that fda review will not involve delays that will adversely affect the company s ability to commercialize additional products or expand permitted uses of existing products  or that the regulatory framework will not change  or that additional regulation will not arise at any stage of the company s product development process which may adversely affect approval of or delay an application or require additional expenditures by the company 
in the event the company s future products are regulated as human drugs or biologics  the fda s review process typically would be substantially longer and more expensive than the review process to which they are currently subject as devices 
the company anticipates that once fda approval for their orthovisc registered trademark product is obtained  orthovisc registered trademark will have to meet regulatory requirements of a class iii device by the fda 
class iii devices are those that generally must receive pre market approval by the fda to ensure their safety and effectiveness eg life sustaining  life supporting and implantable or new devices which have not been found to be substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices and require clinical testing to ensure safety and effectiveness and fda approval prior to marketing and distribution 
in order for the company to commercially distribute orthovisc registered trademark in the us  it must obtain fda approval of a pma 
the pma approval process can be expensive  uncertain and lengthy 
a number of devices for which pre market approval has been sought have never been approved for marketing 
the review of an application often occurs over a protracted time period and may take two years or more from the filing date to complete 
the company submitted a pma for orthovisc registered trademark in december in october  the company was notified by the fda that the company s pma application for orthovisc registered trademark was not approvable and that additional clinical data would be required to demonstrate the effectiveness of orthovisc registered trademark 
the company submitted an ide to the fda in february and received approval in late march to commence a second phase iii clinical study 
the orthovisc registered trademark clinical trial commenced in late april and completed patient enrollment for the trial in august the final patient completed the six month follow up period in late february there can be no assurance that anika will file a pma 
in addition  there can be no guarantee that the fda will approve a pma application for orthovisc registered trademark on a timely basis  if at all  or that the fda review will not involve delays that will affect the company s ability to commercialize additional products or expand permitted uses of existing products 
furthermore  even if granted  the approval may include significant limitations on the indications and other claims sought for use for which the product may be marketed 
the company s developmental ha products  including incert registered trademark  have not obtained regulatory approval in the us for investigational use and or commercial marketing and sale 
the company believes that incert registered trademark will be regulated as a class iii medical device 
before undertaking clinical trials in the us to support a pma  the company must apply for and obtain fda and or institutional review board irb approval of an ide 
there can be no assurance that the company will be permitted to undertake clinical trials of these or other future products in the us or that clinical trials will demonstrate that the products are safe and effective or otherwise satisfy the fda s pre market approval requirements 
orquest has not received regulatory approval in the us for the commercial marketing and sale of ossigel registered trademark 
ossigel registered trademark will be regulated as a class iii medical device with the fda s center of biologics research and review as the lead review center 
there can be no assurance that orquest will be permitted to undertake clinical trials of ossigel registered trademark or  if clinical trials are permitted  that such clinical trials will demonstrate that ossigel registered trademark is safe and effective or otherwise satisfy fda requirements 
once obtained  marketing clearance can be withdrawn by the fda due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial clearance 
the company may be required to make further filings with the fda under certain circumstances 
the fda s regulations require agency approval of a pma supplement for certain changes if they affect the safety and effectiveness of an approved device  including  but not limited to  new indications for use  labeling changes  the use of a different facility to manufacture  process or package the device  changes in manufacturing methods or quality control systems and changes in performance or design specifications 
failure by the company to receive approval of a pma supplement regarding the use of a different manufacturing facility or any other change affecting the safety or effectiveness of an approved device on a timely basis  or at all  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the fda could also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of the company s products and has the power to require the recall of such products 
significant delay or cost in obtaining  or failure to obtain fda clearance to market products  any fda limitations on the use of the company s products  or any withdrawal or suspension of clearance by the fda could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  all fda approved products manufactured by the company must be manufactured in compliance with fda s good manufacturing practices gmp regulations or  for medical devices  fda s quality system regulations qsr 
ongoing compliance with gmp  qsr and other applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic inspection by state and federal agencies  including the fda 
the fda may inspect the company and its facilities from time to time to determine whether the company is in compliance with regulations relating to medical device and manufacturing companies  including regulations concerning manufacturing  testing  quality control and product labeling practices 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to comply with current or future fda requirements applicable to the manufacture of products 
fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation and there can be no assurance that the future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies  with possible retroactive effect  will not adversely affect the company 
in addition  changes in the existing regulations or adoption of new governmental regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s products 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the fda to grant pre market clearance or pre market approval for devices  withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution 
in addition to regulations enforced by the fda  the company is subject to other existing and potential future federal  state  local and foreign regulations 
international regulatory bodies often establish regulations governing product standards  packing requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
to enable the company to market orthovisc registered trademark in europe  the company was required to receive a ce marking certification  an international symbol of quality and compliance with the applicable european medical device directive 
in october  the company received an ec design examination and an ec quality system certificate from a european notified body  which entitles the company to affix a ce marking on orthovisc registered trademark for the treatment of osteoarthritis in synovial joints 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve and or maintain compliance required for ce marking or other foreign regulatory approvals for any or all of its products or that it will be able to produce its products in a timely and profitable manner while complying with applicable requirements 
federal  state  local and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical products are subject to change 
the company cannot predict what impact  if any  such changes might have on its business 
the requirements relating to the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement also vary widely from country to country 
the process of obtaining approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities can be costly  time consuming  and subject to unanticipated delays 
there can be no assurance that approvals of the company s products will be granted or that the company will have the necessary funds to develop certain of such products 
any failure to obtain  or delay in obtaining  such approvals could adversely affect the ability of the company to market its products 
history of losses  uncertainty of future profitability 
from its inception up until december  and in  the company had incurred annual operating losses 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately  the continued development of the company s products will require the commitment of substantial resources to conduct research and preclinical and clinical development programs  and to establish sales and marketing capabilities 
the ability of the company to reach sustained profitability is highly uncertain 
to achieve sustained profitability the company must  among other things  successfully complete development of certain of its products  obtain regulatory approvals and establish sales and marketing capabilities for certain of its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve sustained profitability 
competition 
the company competes with many companies  including  among others  large pharmaceutical companies and specialized medical products companies 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources  larger research and development staffs  more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations and more experience in the regulatory process than the company 
the company also competes with academic institutions  governmental agencies and other research organizations which may be involved in research  development and commercialization of products 
because a number of companies are developing ha products for similar applications  the successful commercialization of a particular product will depend in part upon the ability of the company to complete clinical studies and obtain fda marketing and foreign regulatory approvals prior to its competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty regarding success of clinical trials 
several of the company s products  including orthovisc registered trademark and incert registered trademark  as well as the products of the company s collaborative partners  including ossigel registered trademark  will require clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy in humans for various conditions 
there can be no assurance that the company or its collaborative partners will not encounter problems that will cause it to delay  suspend or terminate clinical trials of any of these products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such clinical trials  if completed  will ultimately demonstrate these products to be safe and efficacious 
dependence upon marketing partners 
the company does not plan to directly market and sell its current products to end users 
therefore  the company s success will be dependent upon the efforts of its marketing partners and the terms and conditions of the company s relationships with such marketing partners 
in addition  there can be no assurances that such marketing partners will not seek to renegotiate their current agreements on terms less favorable to the company 
the company currently manufactures amvisc registered trademark and amvisc registered trademark plus for bausch lomb surgical under an exclusive fixed price  five year supply agreement which contains stated minimum annual purchase obligations and terminates on december  since january   bausch lomb surgical has purchased amvisc registered trademark and amvisc registered trademark plus in amounts substantially in excess of the minimum purchase obligations set forth in the amvisc supply contract 
there can be no assurance that bausch lomb  surgical will continue to purchase amvisc registered trademark and amvisc registered trademark plus at levels beyond the stated minimum annual purchase obligations or that future unit sale prices will not be subject to negotiated reductions 
any such decrease in orders or prices under the amvisc supply contract could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for the years ended december  and  sales of amvisc registered trademark products to bausch lomb surgical accounted for and of product revenues

to date the company has received up front non refundable licensing payments totaling million 
in addition  under the zimmer distribution contract the company has the potential to receive payments aggregating up to an additional million upon the achievement of certain regulatory approvals and enumerated sales milestones 
as an alternative to a million milestone payment due upon receipt of fda approval for the us market  zimmer has the right to elect to acquire shares of the company s common stock equal to the greater of a  divided by of the average daily closing price of the common stock for the prior sixty calendar days or b of the then outstanding common stock but not to exceed of the then outstanding common stock at a premium to the market price for the days prior to the milestone

there can be no assurance that any of these events will not occur  or  even if any such event does not occur  that zimmer will not elect to terminate the agreement 
in fact  zimmer s sales of orthovisc registered trademark for and  are less than the minimums for this consecutive two year period 
despite the fact that zimmer has not given notice within the requisite sixty day period  there can be no assurances that zimmer will not terminate the zimmer distribution contract or seek to renegotiate the agreement on terms less favorable to the company 
any such termination is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to market orthovisc registered trademark  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s future operating results 
orthovisc registered trademark sales to zimmer accounted for and of product revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company will need to obtain the assistance of additional marketing partners for new products which are brought to market and existing products brought to new markets 
there can be no assurance that such additional partners will be available or that such partners will agree to market the company s products on acceptable terms 
the failure to establish strategic partnerships for the marketing and distribution of the company s products on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of market acceptance of future products 
the company s success will depend in part upon the acceptance of the company s future products by the medical community  hospitals and physicians and other health care providers  and third party payors 
such acceptance may depend upon the extent to which the medical community perceives the company s products as safer  more effective or cost competitive than other similar products 
ultimately  for the company s new products to gain general market acceptance  it will also be necessary for the company to develop marketing partners for the distribution of its products 
there can be no assurance that the company s new products will achieve significant market acceptance on a timely basis  or at all 
failure of some or all of the company s future products to achieve significant market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on patents and proprietary technology 
the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to obtain and enforce patents  protect trade secrets  obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties when necessary  and conduct its business without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical  medical products and biotechnology firms  including the company  can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
there can be no assurance that any patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or  if any patents are issued  whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage  or will not be circumvented by others 
in the event a third party has also filed one or more patent applications for any of its inventions  the company may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office pto to determine priority of invention see below  which could result in failure to obtain or the loss of patent protection for the inventions and the loss of any right to use the inventions 
even if the eventual outcome is favorable to the company  such interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to the company 
filing and prosecution of patent applications  litigation to establish the validity and scope of patents  assertion of patent infringement claims against others and the defense of patent infringement claims by others can be expensive and time consuming 
there can be no assurance that in the event that any claims with respect to any of the company s patents  if issued  are challenged by one or more third parties  that any court or patent authority ruling on such challenge will determine that such patent claims are valid and enforceable 
an adverse outcome in such litigation could cause the company to lose exclusivity covered by the disputed rights 
if a third party is found to have rights covering products or processes used by the company  the company could be forced to cease using the technologies or marketing the products covered by such rights  could be subject to significant liabilities to such third party  and could be required to license technologies from such third party 
furthermore  even if the company s patents are determined to be valid  enforceable  and broad in scope  there can be no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around such patents and compete with the company using the resulting alternative technology 
the company has a policy of seeking patent protection for patentable aspects of its proprietary technology 
the company co owns certain united states patents and a patent application which claim certain adhesion prevention uses and certain drug delivery uses of ha  and solely owns patents directed to certain manufacturing processes 
the company also holds an exclusive license from tufts university to use technologies claimed in a united states patent application which has been granted a notice of allowance from the us patent office for the anti metastasis applications of ha oligosaccharides 
the company s patents expire between and and the license expires upon expiration of all related patents 
the company intends to seek patent protection with respect to products and processes developed in the course of its activities when it believes such protection is in its best interest and when the cost of seeking such protection is not inordinate 
however  no assurance can be given that any patent application will be filed  that any filed applications will result in issued patents or that any issued patents will provide the company with a competitive advantage or will not be successfully challenged by third parties 
the protections afforded by patents will depend upon their scope and validity  and others may be able to design around the company s patents 
the company s issued patents and any patents which arise from the company s licensed application would provide competitive protection  if at all  only in the united states 
the company has not  to date  pursued foreign patents equivalent to those issued or applied for in the united states 
other entities have filed patent applications for or have been issued patents concerning various aspects of ha related products or processes 
there can be no assurance that the products or processes developed by the company will not infringe the patent rights of others in the future 
any such infringement may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  the company has received notice from the pto that a third party is attempting to provoke a patent interference with respect to one of the company s co owned patents covering the use of incert registered trademark for post surgical adhesion prevention 
although the company believes that an interference may be declared by the pto  it is too early to determine the merits of the interference or the effect  if any  the interference will have on the company s marketing of incert registered trademark for this use 
the existence of the interference proceeding may have a negative impact on the marketing of the incert registered trademark product  and no assurance can be given that the company would be successful in any such interference proceeding 
if the third party interference were to be decided adversely to the company  involved claims of the company s patent would be cancelled  the company s marketing of the incert registered trademark product may be materially and adversely affected and the third party may enforce patent rights against the company which could prohibit the sale and use of the incert registered trademark products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s future operating results 
the company also relies upon trade secrets and proprietary know how for certain unpatented aspects of its technology 
to protect such information  the company requires all employees  consultants and licensees to enter into confidentiality agreements limiting the disclosure and use of such information 
there can be no assurance that these agreements provide meaningful protection or that they will not be breached  that the company would have adequate remedies for any such breach  or that the company s trade secrets  proprietary know how  and technological advances will not otherwise become known to others 
in addition  there can be no assurance that  despite precautions taken by the company  others have not and will not obtain access to the company s proprietary technology 
further  there can be no assurance that third parties will not independently develop substantially equivalent or better technology 
pursuant to the amvisc supply contract  the company has agreed to grant bausch lomb surgical a royalty free  worldwide  exclusive license to the company s manufacturing and product inventions which relate to amvisc registered trademark products  effective on december   the termination date of the amvisc supply contract which became effective on january  
upon expiration of the amvisc supply contract  there can be no assurance that bausch lomb surgical will continue to use the company to manufacture amvisc registered trademark and amvisc registered trademark plus 
if bausch lomb surgical discontinues the use of the company as a manufacturer after such time  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
risks associated with manufacturing 
the company s results of operations are dependent upon the continued operation of its manufacturing facility in woburn  massachusetts 
the operation of biomedical manufacturing plants involves many risks  including the breakdown  failure or substandard performance of equipment  natural and other disasters  and the need to comply with the requirements of directives of government agencies  including the fda 
in addition  the company relies on a single supplier for syringes and a small number of suppliers for a number of other materials required for the manufacturing and delivery of its ha products 
furthermore  manufacturing processes and research and development efforts of the company involve animals and products derived from animals 
the utilization of animals in research and development and product commercialization is subject to increasing focus by animal rights activists 
the activities of animal rights groups and other organizations that have protested animal based research and development programs or boycotted the products resulting from such programs could cause an interruption in the company s manufacturing processes and research and development efforts 
the occurrence of material operational problems  including but not limited to the events described above  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations during the period of such operational difficulties 
no assurance of growth or ability to manage growth 
the company s future success depends on substantial growth in product sales 
there can be no assurance that such growth can be achieved or  if achieved  can be sustained 
there can be no assurance that even if substantial growth in product sales and the demand for the company s products is achieved  the company will be able to i develop the necessary manufacturing capabilities  ii obtain the assistance of additional marketing partners  iii attract  retain and integrate the required key personnel  or iv implement the financial  accounting and management systems needed to manage growing demand for its products  should it occur 
failure of the company to successfully manage future growth could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
third party reimbursement and health care cost containment initiatives 
in the us and other markets  health care providers  such as hospitals and physicians  that purchase health care products  such as the company s products  generally rely on third party payors  including medicare  medicaid and other health insurance and managed care plans  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the health care product 
the company depends upon the distributors for its products to secure reimbursement 
reimbursement by a third party payor may depend on a number of factors  including the payor s determination that the use of the company s products are clinically useful and cost effective  medically necessary and not experimental or investigational 
since reimbursement approval is required from each payor individually  seeking such approvals can be a time consuming and costly process which  in the future  could require the company or its marketing partners to provide supporting scientific  clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of the company s products to each payor separately 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  and third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain the costs of health care products and services by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products and by refusing in some cases to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the fda has not granted marketing approval 
in addition  congress and certain state legislatures have considered reforms that may affect current reimbursement practices  including controls on health care spending through limitations on the growth of medicare and medicaid spending 
there can be no assurance that third party reimbursement coverage will be available or adequate for any products or services developed by the company 
outside the us  the success of the company s products is also dependent in part upon the availability of reimbursement and health care payment systems 
lack of adequate coverage and reimbursement provided by governments and other third party payors for the company products and services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
need for additional funds  liquidity 
the company had cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments of million as of december  the company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend  however  on numerous factors  including market acceptance of its existing and future products  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in its product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with preclinical studies  clinical trials and product clearances by the fda and other agencies  the cost and timing of its efforts to expand its manufacturing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of its products 
to the extent that funds generated from the company s operations  together with the company s existing capital resources and are insufficient to meet future requirements  the company will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
the terms of any future equity financings may be dilutive to the company s stockholders and the terms of any debt financings may contain restrictive covenants which limit the company s ability to pursue certain courses of action 
the ability of the company to obtain financing is dependent on the status of the company s future business prospects as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to the company or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
exposure to product liability claims 
the testing  marketing and sale of human health care products entail an inherent risk of allegations of product liability  and there can be no assurance that substantial product liability claims will not be asserted against the company 
although the company has not received any material product liability claims to date and has an insurance policy of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate to cover such claims should they arise  there can be no assurance that material claims will not arise in the future or that the company s insurance will be adequate to cover all situations 
moreover  there can be no assurance that such insurance  or additional insurance  if required  will be available in the future or  if available  will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
any product liability claim  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon key personnel 
the company is highly dependent on the members of its management and scientific staff  the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company believes that its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled  scientific  managerial and manufacturing personnel 
the company faces significant competition for such personnel from other companies  research and academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring or retaining the personnel it requires 
the failure to hire and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental regulation 
the company is subject to a variety of local  state and federal government regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic  or other hazardous substances used in the manufacture of the company s products 
any failure by the company to control the use  disposal  removal or storage of hazardous chemicals or toxic substances could subject the company to significant liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to international operations 
approximately and of the company s product sales during and were generated in international markets through marketing partners 
the company s representatives  agents and distributors which sell products in international markets are subject to the laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions in which they operate and in which the company s products are sold 
a number of risks are inherent in international sales and operations 
for example  the volume of international sales may be limited by the imposition of government controls  export license requirements  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  difficulties in managing international operations  import restrictions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
such changes in the volume of sales may have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential volatility of stock price  no control over market making 
the market price of shares of the company s common stock may be highly volatile 
factors such as announcements of new commercial products or technological innovations by the company or its competitors  disclosure of results of clinical testing or regulatory proceedings  governmental regulation and approvals  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products developed by the company and general market conditions may have a significant effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
in particular  the company s stock price declined significantly in october following the company s announcement that the fda had notified the company that its pma for orthovisc registered trademark was not approvable and that additional clinical data would be required to demonstrate the effectiveness of orthovisc registered trademark 
to the extent the company experiences any other adverse developments in the process of seeking fda approval for orthovisc registered trademark  the price of the common stock will likely be subject to further  and perhaps substantial  declines 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in the company s operating results  material announcements by the company or its competitors  governmental regulatory action  conditions in the health care industry generally or in the medical products industry specifically  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market prices of many medical products companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
the company s operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of equity research analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
no person is under any obligation to make a market in the common stock or publish research reports on the company  and any person making a market in the common stock or publishing research reports on the company may discontinue market making or publishing such reports at any time without notice 
there can be no assurance that an active public market in the common stock will be sustained 
possible adverse effect of certain anti takeover provisions 
certain provisions of the company s restated articles of organization and amended and restated by laws could have the effect of discouraging a third party from pursuing a non negotiated takeover of the company and preventing certain changes in control 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  advance notice to the board of directors of stockholder proposals  limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors and to call stockholder meetings  the provision that vacancies on the board of directors be filled by a majority of the remaining directors 
in addition  the board of directors adopted a shareholders rights plan in april the company also is subject to chapter f of the massachusetts general laws which  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits a massachusetts corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder 
these provisions could discourage a third party from pursuing a takeover of the company at a price considered attractive by many stockholders  since such provisions could have the effect of preventing or delaying a potential acquiror from acquiring control of the company and its board of directors 
potential securities class action litigation 
as a result of an informal inquiry from the securities and exchange commission  the company has revised its revenue recognition policies and has restated its operating results for and the first three quarters of in the past  companies that have restated their financial information have been subject to securities class action litigation 
the company may be involved in a securities class action litigation in the future 
such litigation often results in significant costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources and could harm the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on a small number of customers 
the company has historically derived the majority of our revenues from a small number of customers  most of whom resell our products to end users and most of whom are significantly larger companies 
our failure to generate as much revenue as expected from these customers or the failure of these customers to purchase our products would seriously harm our business 
for the year ended december   bausch lomb surgical accounted for of our product revenues and of our account receivables balance and biomeks accounted for of our product revenues and of our accounts receivable balance 
accordingly  present and future customers may terminate their purchasing arrangements with us  significantly reduce or delay their orders or seek to renegotiate their agreements on terms less favorable to the company 
furthermore  in any future negotiations the company may be subject to the perceived or actual leverage the customers may have given their relative size and importance to the company 
any termination  change  reduction or delay in orders could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  unless and until we diversify and expand our customer base  our future success will significantly depend upon the timing and size of future purchases by our largest customers and the financial and operational success of these customers 
the loss of any one of our major customers or the delay of significant orders from such customers  even if only temporary  could reduce or delay our recognition of revenues  harm our reputation in the industry and reduce our ability to accurately predict cash flow  and  as a consequence  could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
