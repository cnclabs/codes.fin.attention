item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations backlog 
research and development the company conducts research and development r d pursuant to united states government r d contracts and as part of its own r d program 
united states government r d contracts generated approximately l million of revenues in fiscal year  approximately million of revenues in fiscal year  and approximately million of revenues in fiscal year the company s r d program is funded by the billing rates charged to its customers 
the company s r d expenditures as a percentage of revenues in fiscal years   and were   and  respectively 
research and development conducted by the company was approximately million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year  and million for fiscal year the company believes that its investment in r d provides it with a significant competitive advantage 
the company seeks to develop technology capable of addressing new telecommunication signal processing requirements before its competitors 
in addition  the company focuses its r d on developing products that can be used  with or without further modification  to satisfy various needs of a variety of customers  thereby permitting the company to offer a solution promptly 
the company attempts to allocate its r d funds among projects intended to yield revenues within one to two years  projects intended to yield revenues in two to five years  and projects intended to yield revenues in more than five years 
most of the company s r d expenditures are for projects intended to yield revenues within one to two years 
an important aspect of the company s r d efforts is understanding telecommunication trends to anticipate the future signal processing needs of its customers 
not only does this allow the company to direct its r d engineering efforts to produce solutions promptly once a customer expresses a need  but it often allows the company to educate the customer about its potential needs and simultaneously present a conceptual solution to those needs 
company divisions the company is organized into a technical operations group and a finance division 
the technical operations group has four divisions 
three of these divisions communication systems  multichannel systems and personal communications systems are engineering divisions which are primarily responsible for conducting all r d activities as well as the initial development of products 
the fourth division is the operations division which is primarily responsible for manufacturing multiple units of products 
all divisions work together to ensure that production related issues such as manufacturability  reliability and maintainability are addressed from initial product definition through final product shipment 
the company s technical staff includes personnel with systems development expertise  which the company applies not only to systems development but also to its product development in order to ensure the compatibility of its products with a variety of system requirements 
as of january   there were employees in the engineering divisions and employees in the operations division 
see employees 
engineering 
the engineering divisions are responsible for all r d 
the company s r d activities include both united states government r d contracts and the company s r d projects 
the engineering division activities are directed toward developing products that will ultimately be produced by the operations division 
the engineering divisions work in conjunction with the operations division to assure that the development efforts will culminate in a product able to be manufactured efficiently in quantity 
in addition to corporate headquarters in sunnyvale  california  the company maintains engineering offices in herndon  virginia  annapolis junction  maryland  salt lake city  utah  and hillsboro  oregon 
as of january  there were employees in these locations 
most of the personnel staffing these offices are technical personnel and  in addition to marketing activities  are involved in research and development and customer support for example  installation  training  and troubleshooting 
operations 
the operations division is responsible for completing final product development and manufacturing multiple units of products 
by combining engineering and production expertise within the operations division  the company believes it is able to maximize manufacturing efficiency and  therefore  reduce overall production costs 
operations manufactures products using batch production methods 
the division achieves labor efficiency by extensive cross training of its personnel  which permits these personnel to participate in the production of all the company s products 
the division is also responsible for managing the company s purchases of goods and services  including third party manufacturing and assembly services 
see suppliers 
suppliers the company uses suppliers in order to obtain quality goos and services without incurring the costs of providing those goods and services in house 
the company purchases from suppliers nearly all circuit boards  integrated circuits  and other components used in its products 
in addition  the company contracts with suppliers to assemble some of its products 
the company s reliance on suppliers involves several risks  including the possibility of a shortage of certain key components and assemblies and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality  and cots 
if the company experiences significant availability or quality control problems in the future  its operating results could be adversely affected 
although the company procures most of its parts and components from multiple sources or believes that these components are readily available from numerous other sources  certain components are available only from sole sources or from a limited number of sources 
a number of the company s products contain critical components like single board computers available solely from motorola  inc and force computers  inc and field programmable gate arrays available solely from xilinx  inc while the company believes that substitute components or assemblies could be obtained  use of substitutes would require development of new suppliers or would require the company to re engineer its products  or both  which could delay the company s shipment of its products and could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
competition the telecommunication signal processing equipment market is highly competitive and the company expects that competition will increase in the future 
some of the company s current and potential competitors have significantly greater technical  manufacturing  financial  and marketing resources that the company 
the company s current competitors include l communications corporation  boeing north america  e systems  inc a subsidiary of raytheon corporation  general dynamics corporation  harris corporation  lockheed martin corporation  motorola government electronics group a subsidiary of motorola  inc  sat corporation  comsat corporation  trw  inc  and itt corp 
substantial competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the competition for competitive bid contracts differs from the competition for sole source contracts 
companies competing for competitive bid contracts prepare bids and proposals in response either to a commercial or government request and typically compete on price 
potential suppliers compete informally for sole source contracts through r d investment and marketing efforts 
companies competing for sole source contracts attempt to identify the customer s requirements early and invest in solutions so that they can demonstrate a distinguishing expertise or technology promptly after the customer has identified a signal processing requirement 
the principal factors of competition for sole source contracts include investments in r d  the ability to respond to government needs promptly  product price relative to performance  quality  and customer support 
the company believes that it competes favorably on each of these factors 
proprietary rights the united states government has rights to most of the technology developed by the company under government contracts  including rights to permit other companies  including the company s competitors  to use this technology to develop products for the united states government 
the company is not aware that the united states government has exercised these rights 
the company has filed patent applications for certain of its technology 
as of october   three patents have been granted to the company 
the company believes that given the rapidly changing nature of signal collection and processing technology  its future success will depend primarily upon the technical competence and creative skills of its personnel 
the company attempts to protect its trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with customers  employees  and consultants and other security measures 
there can be no assurance that the measures adopted by the company for the protection of its intellectual property will be adequate 
although the company does not believe and has not received notice that it is infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that such a claim will not be asserted against the company 
in the event any third party made a valid claim against the company and a license was not made available to the company on commercially reasonable terms  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
government regulations many of the company s operations are subject to compliance with regulatory requirements of federal  state and municipal authorities  including regulations concerning employment obligations and affirmative action  workplace safety  and protection of the environment 
while compliance with applicable regulations has not adversely affected the company s operations in the past  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be in compliance in the future or that these regulations will not change 
in particular  the company must comply with detailed government procurement and contracting regulations and with united states government security regulations  certain of which carry substantial penalty provisions for nonperformance or misrepresentation in the course of negotiations 
failure of the company to comply with its government procurements or contracting obligations or security obligations could result in penalties or suspension of the company form government contracting  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
see item business customers  contracts  and marketing 
employees as of january   the company had approximately full time employees  of whom hold advanced technical degrees master and or doctoral degrees  including with doctoral degrees 
the company s business requires that a large number of its technical employees obtain security clearances from the united states government  which limits the available pool of eligible candidates for such positions to those who can satisfy the prerequisites to obtaining these clearances 
in particular  the personnel involved in signal reconnaissance marketing require the appropriate clearances to meet with government technical representatives and discuss the government s needs 
the company has a united states government sanctioned security program that allows staff members to obtain appropriate clearances 
approximately of the company s staff have security clearances 
the success of the company is dependent on attracting  retaining  and motivating qualified key management and technical personnel  the loss of whom  could adversely affect the company s business 
such personnel are in great demand and limited supply 
the company believes its employees are its most valuable resource and that its workforce possesses a strong feeling of dedication to and pride in the company 
this dedication is reinforced through incentive compensation arrangements based on company performance 
the company s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements  and the company has never experienced a work stoppage 
summary of business considerations and certain factors that may affect future results of operations and or stock price the company s future operating results and stock price may be subject to volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis  due to the following customer concentration historically  defense and intelligence agencies of the united states government have accounted for almost all of the company s revenues 
future reductions in united states government spending on signal reconnaissance and communications equipment or future changes in the kind of signal reconnaissance and communications products or services required by the united states government agencies could limit demand for the company s products which would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
in addition  as a supplier of these agencies  the company must comply with numerous regulations  including regulations governing security and contracting practices 
failure to comply with these regulations could disqualify the company as a supplier of these agencies  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
revenue concentration due to the award of certain larger contracts the company has experienced a significant concentration of revenues from a single contract in recent periods 
revenue related to a single contract comprised of of revenue for fiscal this compares to and attributable to the same contract in fiscal and  respectively 
this contract may be terminated at the sole discretion of the united states government 
if this contract or other larger contracts of the company were terminated  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
competition the telecommunication signal processing market is highly competitive and the company expects that competition will increase in the future 
some of the company s current and potential competitors have significantly greater technical  manufacturing  financial  and marketing resources than the company 
substantial competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
dependence upon personnel the company s ability to execute its business plan is contingent upon successfully attracting and retaining qualified employees 
during the last few years  the company has experienced difficulty in attracting new talent due to an increasingly competitive market for qualified personnel 
management believes this effect continues to be attributable to the expanding us economy and  in particular  the local california economy where the company must compete for new talent in the rapidly expanding telecommunications sector and due to the difficulty in recruiting new staff capable of obtaining the necessary security clearance 
see employees 
the company has taken step to bolster its ability to attract and retain staff by opening additional offices in salt lake city  utah and in hillsboro  oregon 
the company believes these new offices  in addition to the increased investment made in the company s human resources activities during fiscal  should allow it to successfully attract and retain qualified employees 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
risk of fixed price and contract terminations a significant portion of the company s revenues are derived from fixed price contracts 
under fixed price contracts  unexpected increases in the cost to develop or manufacture a product  whether due to inaccurate estimates in the bidding process  unanticipated increases in materials costs  inefficiencies or other factors  are borne by the company 
the company has experienced cost overruns in the past that have resulted in losses on certain contracts 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience cost overruns in the future or that such overruns will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
in addition  almost all of the company s contracts contain termination clauses which permit contract termination upon the company s default or for the convenience of the other contracting party 
in either case  termination could adversely affect the company s operating results 
although the company has not experienced any material contract terminations to date  there can be no assurance that such terminations will not occur in the future 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results and market volatility the company has experienced significant fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter and expects that it will continue to experience such fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations are caused by  among other factors  conditions inherent in government contracting and the company s business  such as the timing of cost and expense recognition for contracts and the united states government contracting and budget cycles 
fluctuations in quarterly results  shortfalls in revenues or earnings from levels forecast by securities analysts  changes in estimates by analysts  competition  or announcements of extraordinary events such as acquisitions or litigation may cause the price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  there can be assurance that an active trading market will be sustained for the company s common stock 
the sock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many technology companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic and market conditions  may adversely affect the future market price of the company s common stock 
rapid technological change the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology 
the company believes that it has been successful to date in identifying certain signal reconnaissance and industrial marketplace needs early  investing in research and development to meet these needs  and delivering products before the company s competitors 
the company believes that its future success will depend upon continuing to develop and introduce  in a timely manner  products capable of collecting or processing new types of telecommunications signals 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able develop and market new products successfully in the future or respond effectively to technological changes  such as data encryption technology  network intrusion detection and others  or that new products introduced by others will not render the company s products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
dependence upon certain suppliers although the company procures most of its parts and components from multiple sources or believes that these components are readily available from numerous other sources  certain components are available only from sole sources or from a limited number of sources 
a number of the company s product contain critical components like single board computers available solely from motorola and force computers and field programmable gate arrays available solely from xilinx  inc while the company believes that substitute components or assemblies could be obtained  use of substitutes would require development of new suppliers or would require the company to re engineer its products  or both  which could delay the company s shipment of its products and could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
business disruption the company s corporate headquarters  including most of its research and development operations and production facilities  are located in the silicon valley area of northern california  a region known for seismic activity 
a significant earthquake could materially affect operating results 
the company is not insured for most losses and business interruptions of this kind 
year yk risks the company has implemented a program over the last two and a half years to define and minimize risks related to transitioning to the year and beyond 
the program and associated risk assessment was segregated into three main areas product readiness program  internal infrastructure readiness program and  business partners readiness program 
for each of the three areas  the company systematically performed risk assessments  conducted tests and implemented remediation activities 
the company s efforts in this area have been successful to date 
the company has transitioned all of its systems to the new millennium without experiencing significant problems in any of its product  infrastructure or business partner programs 
further  the company believes it has identified  tested and developed a plan to handle all known year concerns in accordance with its contractual obligations and operational requirements 
thus  management believes that the risk related to future exposure of year issues is minimal 
all costs related to year readiness have been borne by the company and recovered in the product prices and therefore  have not had a material impact on its operating results 
item properties the company s corporate offices that also serve as its primary research and development  engineering  production  marketing  and administrative offices are located in sunnyvale  california 
the company leases and occupies six buildings of approximately  square feet whose term expires in march under the terms of the lease  the company has options to lease three additional buildings 
the first option was exercised in july for which the construction of a  square foot building started in january  occupancy is anticipated in november the second option for a  square foot building was exercised in september  occupancy is targeted for november the third option for another  square foot building can be exercised anytime through february  the company has not taken any action on this option 
in addition  the company maintains four offices within the united states for small development  marketing and administrative functions 
the company leases  square feet of a  square foot building in annapolis junction  maryland that expires in april  a  square foot building in herndon  virginia that expires in january   square feet of a  square foot building in hillsboro  oregon that expires in october  and  square feet of a  square foot building in salt lake city  utah that expires in april the company s business requires that it maintain at each of its offices a facility clearance sponsored and approved by the united states government 
this approval could be suspended or revoked if the company is found not to have complied with security regulations applicable to such facilities 
any revocation or suspension of such approval that materially delayed the company s delivery of its products to customers would materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
although the company has adopted policies directed at assuring its compliance with relevant regulations  there can be no assurance that the approved status of the company s facilities will continue without interruption 
item legal proceedings the company from time to time is engaged in various legal actions including but not limited to wrongful termination allegations  governmental agency investigations and employee discrimination allegations 
the company  believes that these legal actions will not  either individually or in aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the operating results or financial condition of the company

signal reconnaissance equipment is used for the monitoring of foreign telecommunications  predominantly by the united states government and allied foreign governments 
industrial applications include spectrum monitoring equipment for commercial communication satellite systems  and data intrusion detection equipment for data network protection 
signal reconnaissance systems are composed of collection equipment and processing equipment 
signal collection equipment consist of sophisticated receivers that can scan the radio frequency rf spectrum cellular telephone  microwave  ship to shore  military transmissions  etc 
to collect certain signals from potentially thousands of signals within the rf spectrum 
process equipment  using sophisticated software and hardware  evaluates the characteristics of collected signals and selects those signals likely to contain relevant information 
spectrum monitoring equipment evaluate a communication satellite s frequency spectrum usage to detect any misuse that could cause substandard service 
data intrusion detection equipment monitor commercial data networks to detect unauthorized system entry for the purpose of altering or pirating data 
since inception  the company has focused its efforts primarily on processing equipment  but also provides specialized collection equipment  as well as complete signal processing systems 
the company s business involves risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  those contained in this report in business considerations and certain factors that may affect future results of operations and or stock prices 
the company s revenues are primarily generated from sales of its products and services to two agencies of the united states government 
the two agencies accounted for and  respectively  of revenues in fiscal in fiscal  the two agencies accounted for and  respectively  of revenues and in fiscal  the percentages of revenues derived from these two agencies were and  respectively 
the company s revenues are derived from either fixed price contracts  which provide that the company perform a contract for a fixed price and assume the risk of any cost overruns or cost plus reimbursement contracts  which provide that the company receive the direct and indirect costs of performance plus a negotiated profit 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from fixed price contracts  and approximately of the company s revenues were derived from cost plus reimbursement contracts 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from fixed price contracts  and approximately of the company s revenues were derived from cost plus reimbursement contracts 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from fixed price contracts  and approximately of the company s revenues were derived from cost plus reimbursement contracts 
under fixed price contracts  unexpected increases in the cost to develop or manufacture a product  whether due to inaccurate estimates in the bidding process  unanticipated increases in material costs  inefficiencies or other factors  are borne by the company  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in accounting for cost plus reimbursement type contracts  all costs are charged to operations as incurred including allowable administrative expenses  and revenues are recognized based on costs incurred plus estimated fee rates at the date of evaluation 
in accounting for fixed price type contracts  revenue is recognized using the percent completion method which is substantially the same as that used for cost type contracts described above 
all costs are charged to operations including allowable administrative expenses as incurred  and revenues are recognized based on estimated costs and profits at completion on a contract by contract basis 
losses on any individual contracts are provided for at the time they become known 
see note to financial statements 
operating results fiscal years comparison the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues from contracts and  at the end of each period indicated  the company s backlog year ended october  revenues from contracts operating expenses contract costs research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income interest income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income backlog thousands of dollars    revenues revenues from contracts increased by from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal revenues increased by from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal the increase in revenues during fiscal is primarily due to an increase in revenue generated by the company s development and engineering services contracts generated by the company s development and engineering services contracts which were partially offset by a decrease in sales of off the shelf products 
management believes the decrease in revenues resulting from lower off the shelf product sales has adversely impacted the fiscal revenue growth 
the revenue increase in fiscal is due  in part  to increased contract activity experienced in the military marketplace and  in part  due to an increasing demand from the intelligence agencies for development contracts 
the following table identifies the source of the company s revenues for fiscal years  and by major market fy fy fy intelligence agencies military foreign commercial backlog the company s backlog  which consists of anticipated revenues from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts excluding unexercised options  was approximately  at the end of fiscal this represents an increase of from the prior year s ending backlog of approximately  the increase in orders in fiscal is in part due to receiving orders delayed from the previous year and  in part  to a resurgence in the need for signal reconnaissance capabilities by the united states government 
the decrease in backlog between fiscal and fiscal was due in part to a delay in specific contract awards from the united states government and  in part  due to a reduced number of awards for the company s off the shelf products 
while management believes that the demand for global intelligence and tactical communications systems should continue  there can be no assurances that the company will continue to experience growth in its backlog or its revenues 
contract costs contract costs consist of direct costs on contracts  such as labor  materials and manufacturing overhead costs 
contract costs  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  contract costs in fiscal year were lower than contract costs of of revenues in fiscal year the decrease in contract costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is in part attributable to lowering of reserves related to a government investigation which commenced during fiscal and in part  due to a reduction in estimated losses on certain fixed price contracts 
both reductions reflect management s belief that the risk of loss has been mitigated 
the reserve reduction recorded during fiscal totaled approximately  the decrease in contract costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  is attributable  in part  to higher contract fees and  in part due to the lower manufacturing overhead applied to contracts during fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expenses company directed investment in research and development consists of expenditures recoverable from customers through the company s billing rates and expenditures funded by the company from earnings 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were  and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased by approximately  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and grew as a percentage of revenues in fiscal when compared to the percentage of revenue in fiscal the increase in research and development spending during both fiscal year and fiscal year are due to management s decision to increase research and development activities for the benefit of future business 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development spending was low in fiscal year primarily due to the greater demand of contract work which limited the availability of staff to work on research and development contracts 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include administrative salaries  costs related to the company s marketing and proposal activities  and other administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses were approximately  or of revenues in fiscal compared to approximately  or of revenues in fiscal and approximately  or of revenues in fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal in general and administrative expenses of approximately  and as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to increased efforts in marketing  and bid and proposal activity 
in recent years  management has continued to emphasize the marketing component of general and administrative expenses in an effort to generate revenues in future periods 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal relative to fiscal is primarily attributable to the higher profit recognized on contracts during fiscal compared to fiscal interest income expense net net interest income expense for fiscal increased approximately  to approximately  from approximately of  net interest income in fiscal net interest income in fiscal increased approximately  over net interest income in fiscal of approximately  the continued increase in interest income during the fiscal years and is due primarily to investing higher cash balances generated from operations 
provision for income taxes income taxes as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes have been provided for at a combined federal and state rate of for both fiscal years and and for fiscal year the and effective tax rates are lower than the combined federal and state statutory income tax rates primarily due to the benefit derived from federal and state income tax credits 
the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is primarily a result of the increase in federal and state tax liabilities as a result of the lower impact of federal and state tax credits on increased profitability 
analysis of liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity has been the cash flow generated from operations  as well as the issuance of common stock through its employee stock plans 
the company has a  unsecured  revolving line of credit for short term cash requirements bearing interest at the bank s reference rate as of october  
outstanding amounts on the line of credit were zero at october  and the line expires on march  net cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities has varied significantly from year to year 
for fiscal years  and  cash provided by operating activities was approximately   and  respectively 
the year to year variances are primarily the result of changes in net income  changes in accounts receivable  changes in the level of accrued liabilities and the change in inventories held by the company 
during fiscal year net income was approximately  a decrease from approximately  in fiscal year the decrease in net income for fiscal year was primarily due to the application of a higher general and administrative rate in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the improvement in net income for fiscal year over fiscal year is primarily due to an increase in the average gross margin profitability recorded on contracts during the year  and  in part  due to a reduction in general and administrative expenses recorded as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 
during fiscal  accounts receivable increased by approximately  when compared to a decrease of approximately  for fiscal year the increase in accounts receivable in fiscal year is primarily due to the strong revenues and associated billings in the fourth quarter 
the decrease in accounts receivable in fiscal is due  in part to greater collection efforts and  in part  due to collections received from a one time billing modification authorized by the united states government in the fourth quarter of fiscal cash used by the increased levels of inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets of approximately  in fiscal year is primarily due to the increase in purchases for anticipated future production contracts 
cash used by the increased levels of inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets of approximately  in fiscal is primarily due to the increase in work in progress for engineering and production contracts and  in part  due to the increase in prepaid income taxes related to higher profits 
cash provided by the increased levels of liabilities for fiscal year approximated  and was primarily due to an increase in accrued employee related benefits  the accrual for the fourth quarter dividend payment  and an increase in trade accounts payable resulting from the higher revenue volume recorded during the last quarter of fiscal this increase in accrued liabilities was partially offset by a reduction in the reserves recorded for previously anticipated losses see management discussion and analysis contract costs 
cash provided by the increased levels of liabilities for fiscal approximated  and was primarily due to increased tax liabilities associated with higher profit margins 
net cash from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was approximately   and  during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the use of cash for investing activities in each of the last three fiscal years was primarily for additions to property and equipment 
the company s capital investment continues to be driven by an increase in the number of new employees and by the level of development type contracts that have required test and computing equipment 
cash provided by investing activities throughout fiscal year was due to the maturity of short term investments  primarily in us government treasuries and was approximately  cash provided by investing activities was approximately  during fiscal year related to net the purchases and maturities of short term investments in us government treasuries 
net cash from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was approximately  during fiscal year compared to approximately  used in financing activities during fiscal year and approximately  provided by financing activities during fiscal year during fiscal year  the  used in financing activities is primarily attributable to approximately  repurchases of common stock and an approximately  dividend payment partially offset by the issuance of approximately  of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan and stock option plan 
during fiscal  the  used in financing activities is attributable to approximately  of common stock repurchases initiated under the company s stock repurchase program offset by the issuance of approximately  of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan and stock option plan 
the cash provided by financing activities of approximately  in fiscal year was predominately due to the issuance of common stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan and stock option plan 
the company believes that the funds generated from operations  existing working capital  and amounts available under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet its cash needs for at least the next months
