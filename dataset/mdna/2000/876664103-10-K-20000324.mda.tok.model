item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the financial statements of taubman centers  inc and the notes thereto 
general background and performance measurement the company owns a managing general partner s interest in the taubman realty group limited partnership the operating partnership or trg  through which the company conducts all of its operations 
the operating partnership owns  develops  acquires  and operates regional shopping centers nationally 
the consolidated businesses consist of shopping centers that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreement  development projects for future regional shopping centers and the taubman company limited partnership the manager 
shopping centers that are not controlled and that are owned through joint ventures with third parties unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
the operations of the shopping centers are best understood by measuring their performance as a whole  without regard to the company s ownership interest 
consequently  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the consolidated businesses  the operations of the unconsolidated joint ventures are presented and discussed as a whole 
on september   the operating partnership exchanged interests in shopping centers nine consolidated businesses and one unconsolidated joint venture and a share of the operating partnership s debt for all of the partnership units owned by two general motors pension trusts gmpt the gmpt exchange 
see results of operations gmpt exchange and related transactions below 
performance statistics presented below exclude these centers transferred centers 
mall tenant sales and center revenues over the long term  the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately of these revenues and because mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent  and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that mall tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs 
the company believes that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
the following table summarizes occupancy costs  excluding utilities  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales 
mall tenant sales in thousands    sales per square foot minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs occupancy historically  average annual occupancy has been within a narrow band 
in the last ten years  average annual occupancy has ranged between and 
mall tenant average occupancy  ending occupancy and leased space rates are as follows mall tenant average occupancy ending occupancy leased space rental rates as leases have expired in the shopping centers  the company has generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
in a period of increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason 
however  center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
the following table contains certain information regarding per square foot base rent at the shopping centers that have been owned and open for five years 
average base rent per square foot all mall tenants stores closing during the year stores opening during the year in  average base rent per square foot for stores opening during the year was somewhat weighted by the leasing of smaller than average spaces at several of the company s most productive centers 
the company expects the rent spread between opening and closing stores in to be in the company s historic range of to per square foot 
however  this statistic is difficult to predict in part because the company s leasing policies and practices may result in early lease terminations with actual average closing rents per square foot which may vary from the average rent per square foot of scheduled lease expirations 
seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school events 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter 
st nd rd th quarter quarter quarter quarter total in thousands mall tenant sales      revenues      occupancy average ending leased space because the seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries  mall tenant occupancy costs the sum of minimum rents  percentage rents and expense recoveries relative to sales are considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter 
st nd rd th quarter quarter quarter quarter total minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs results of operations the following represent significant debt and equity transactions  new center openings  expansions  and acquisitions which affect the operating results described under comparison of to gmpt exchange and related transactions on september   the operating partnership exchanged interests in shopping centers nine wholly owned and one unconsolidated joint venture  together with million of debt  for all of gmpt s partnership units approximately million units with a fair value of million  based on the average stock price of the company s common shares of for the two week period prior to the closing  providing the company with a majority and controlling interest in the operating partnership 
the operating partnership continues to manage the centers exchanged under management agreements with gmpt 
the management agreements are cancelable with days notice 
certain costs of providing services under these agreements  including administrative and certain other fixed costs  would not necessarily be eliminated if the contracts were to be canceled or not renewed 
the actual reduction of costs would be affected by whether all or a portion of the contracts were canceled or not renewed  timing of the cancellation or non renewal  and actual or anticipated changes in the operating partnership s owned or managed portfolio 
in anticipation of the gmpt exchange  the operating partnership used the billion proceeds from two bridge loans to extinguish billion of debt in september the remaining proceeds were used primarily to pay prepayment premiums and transaction costs

during the fourth quarter of  general and administrative expense decreased million from the comparable period in during  general and administrative expense decreased million from substantially all of the decrease in expense occurred in the first three quarters of because the company s portfolio changed significantly as a result of the gmpt exchange  the results of operations of the transferred centers have been separately classified within the consolidated businesses and unconsolidated joint ventures for purposes of analyzing and understanding the historical results of the current portfolio 
since the company s interest in the operating partnership has been its sole material asset throughout all periods presented  references in the following discussion to the company include the operating partnership  except where intercompany transactions are discussed or as otherwise noted  even though the operating partnership did not become a consolidated subsidiary until september other debt and equity transactions in september and november  the operating partnership completed private placements totaling million of cumulative redeemable preferred partnership equity series c preferred equity and series d preferred equity  respectively  which were purchased by institutional investors

both great lakes crossing and macarthur center are owned by joint ventures in which the operating partnership has a controlling interest  and consequently the results of these centers are consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the operating partnership is entitled to a preferred return on its equity contributions to these centers 
the contributed capital was used to fund construction costs 
the income effect of the cumulative preferred return net of the interest on the operating partnership s associated borrowings was approximately million for the net effect in of any recurring preference is expected to be minimal 
at cherry creek  a  square foot expansion opened in stages throughout the fall of in november  the operating partnership acquired lord associates  a retail leasing firm based in alexandria  virginia for million in cash and million in partnership units  which are subject to certain contingencies

upon completion of the transaction  the company expects to recognize a gain on the exchange  representing the excess of the fair value over the net book basis of the company s interest in lakeside mall  adjusted for the million paid and transaction costs 
aside from this book gain  the company does not expect the transaction to have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
in january  the owned unconsolidated joint venture that owns stamford town center completed a million secured financing 
the new financing bears interest at a rate of one month libor plus and matures in with a two year extension option

sensitivity analysis the company has exposure to interest rate risk on its debt obligations and interest rate instruments 
based on the operating partnership s beneficial interest in debt and interest rates in effect at december   a one percent increase in interest rates on floating rate debt would decrease cash flows by approximately million and  due to the effect of capitalized interest  annual earnings by approximately million

the balance on the dolphin mall loan was million at december  all of the loan agreements provide for a reduction of the amount guaranteed as certain center performance and valuation criteria are met 
funds from operations a principal factor that the company considers in determining dividends to shareowners is funds from operations ffo  which is defined as income before extraordinary and unusual items  real estate depreciation and amortization  and the allocation to the minority interest in the operating partnership  less preferred dividends and distributions 
funds from operations does not represent cash flows from operations  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity 
however  the national association of real estate investment trusts suggests that funds from operations is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits 
in october  nareit approved certain clarifications of the definition of ffo  including that non recurring items that are not defined as extraordinary under generally accepted accounting principles should be reflected in the calculation of ffo 
the clarified definition is effective january  and restatement of all periods presented is recommended 
under the clarified definition  the company would have included in ffo  for the year ended december   the million restructuring charge results of operations gmpt exchange and related transactions  resulting in an approximate decrease to the company s ffo per share reported for that period 
there would have been no change to the amounts reported for reconciliation of net income to funds from operations year ended year ended december  december  in millions of dollars income before extraordinary items  minority and preferred interests restructuring loss depreciation and amortization share of unconsolidated joint ventures depreciation and amortization other income expenses  net non real estate depreciation preferred dividends and distributions minority interest in consolidated joint ventures funds from operations funds from operations allocable to the company includes gains on peripheral land sales of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

dividends the company pays regular quarterly dividends to its common and series a preferred shareowners 
dividends to its common shareowners are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on the cash available to the company  its financial condition  capital and other requirements  and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
preferred dividends accrue regardless of whether earnings  cash availability  or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends 
on december   the company declared a quarterly dividend of per common share payable january  to shareowners of record on december  the board of directors also declared a quarterly dividend of per share on the company s series a preferred stock  paid december  to shareowners of record on december  common dividends declared totaled per common share in  of which represented return of capital and represented ordinary income  compared to dividends declared in of per common share  of which represented return of capital and represented ordinary income 
the tax status of total common dividends declared and to be declared  assuming continuation of a per common share quarterly dividend  is estimated to be approximately return of capital  and approximately ordinary income 
series a preferred dividends declared were per preferred share in and  all of which represented ordinary income 
the tax status of total dividends to be paid on series a preferred stock is estimated to be ordinary income 
these are forward looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including the amount of dividends declared  changes in the company s share of anticipated taxable income of the operating partnership due to the actual results of the operating partnership  changes in the number of the company s outstanding shares  property acquisitions or dispositions  financing transactions  including refinancing of existing debt  and changes in the internal revenue code or its application 
the annual determination of the company s common dividends is based on anticipated funds from operations available after preferred dividends  as well as financing considerations and other appropriate factors 
further  the company has decided that the growth in common dividends will be less than the growth in funds from operations for the immediate future 
any inability of the operating partnership or its joint ventures to secure financing as required to fund maturing debts  capital expenditures and changes in working capital  including development activities and expansions  may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such obligations  thereby possibly reducing distributions to partners of the operating partnership and funds available to the company for the payment of dividends
