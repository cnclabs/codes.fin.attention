the company s results of operations in fiscal and were affected by the following factors to meet its customers needs  the company introduced a line of broadband nids with features and functionality that the company believes were instrumental in its winning two major contracts in july and september of fiscal with an rboc and an independent telco  respectively  each of which was a pre existing unaffiliated customer 
for strategic purposes  the company accepted orders under one of these contracts that it believed it could fulfill under an aggressive delivery time schedule that mandated it to seek to accelerate production 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing through fiscal  the company incurred additional manufacturing expenses in gearing up toward the accelerated production of its new broadband nid product line  compounded  in the second quarter of fiscal  by production disruptions as the company sought to meet a customer s requested delivery schedules 
these additional manufacturing costs included the hiring of temporary personnel during the initial phases of production  the temporary outsourcing of certain production processes  initial purchases of materials in smaller than usual quantities for which volume discounts were not available  lower initial manufacturing yields and additional freight and other expediting costs 
additionally  results were also adversely affected by continuing expenditures relating to the company s movement of certain production processes to the company s facility in the dominican republic 
the disruptions were primarily caused by the failure of certain vendors to meet the company s delivery requirements for required molds and inventory components  production breakdowns which produced significant delays and yield losses during the initial production process and delays in completing the training of permanent employees for both the company s puerto rico and dominican republic facilities  as well as the hiring of temporary manufacturing employees at its puerto rico facilities to meet the accelerated production schedule 
while the company resolved most of the production disruption issues toward the end of the second quarter  during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company continued to experience certain yield losses  costs associated with outsourcing the production of certain injection molded parts and added costs to air freight products to meet customer delivery requirements
