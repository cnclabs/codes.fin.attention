we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
results of operations the electronics industry is subject to rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price competition 
these and other factors affecting the electronics industry  or any of our major customers in particular  could materially harm our results of operations 
results of operations for years ended august   and the following table summarizes certain items in the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales 
the financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
years ended august  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development acquisition costs operating income net interest income income before income taxes income taxes net income net sales our net sales have increased significantly in each of the past several years  reflecting the growing trend toward outsourcing within the electronics industry 
for the year ended august   net sales grew to billion  an increase of over fiscal net sales of billion in fiscal were greater than fiscal the sales growth in fiscal compared with fiscal was attributable to new program ramp ups  strong demand from our customers worldwide and acquisitions made during fiscal the sales growth in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to the significant increase in sales volume from both existing and new customers worldwide  and the transfer of production from certain customer plants to various solectron locations around the world 
we do not currently anticipate any future decline in sales  but continue to seek to diversify our customer base among many countries  market segments and product lines within market segments 
we are organized in three business units manufacturing and operations  technology solutions  and global services 
our core business group  manufacturing and operations  provided  and of net sales  respectively  for fiscal  and our technology solutions group  consisting of smart and force  contributed  and of net sales  respectively  for fiscal  and our global services unit  which was formed in fiscal and pooled with americom and the services unit of bluegum  contributed  and of net sales  respectively  in fiscal  and manufacturing and operations net sales from the worldwide manufacturing and operations group have contributed a significant share of total sales for the past three fiscal years 
fiscal year net sales grew to billion  an increase of over fiscal year the increase was principally due to strong demand growth from our customers and to acquisitions  including alcatel s telecommunications manufacturing business in liverpool  australia  by our subsidiary bluegum  ibm ecat in austin  texas  trimble of california  ibm s netfinity server operations in greenock  scotland  ericsson s telecommunications infrastructure equipment operations in longuenesse  france  and ostersund  sweden  and zhone technologies of california  as well as our acquisition of alcatel s manufacturing business in aguadilla  puerto rico 
in fiscal year  net sales from manufacturing and operations was billion  which was greater than fiscal the increase in manufacturing and operations sales in fiscal from was primarily due to demand increases and to acquisitions of assets from ericsson  ncr and mitsubishi during fiscal and within the americas  the milpitas site in california  guadalajara site in mexico and austin site in texas were the largest contributors to the sales increase 
the increase in fiscal versus was primarily due to new programs from our customers  partially offset by limited sales growth in the americas caused by the shortage of components 
sales continued to grow in the milpitas site despite our strategic transfer of personal computer pcb programs and computer peripherals systems assembly programs to mexico and networking business to penang  malaysia 
the increase in net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal resulted from strong demand growth and acquisitions 
in europe  net sales stayed relatively flat in fiscal versus fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal was principally due to overall business growth and increased demand from our telecommunications customers 
in asia pacific  net sales growth in fiscal was primarily due to demand growth in mobile phone  networking and personal computer projects 
in particular  sales growth in the penang site was attributable to the growth of networking business 
in addition  our subsidiary bluegum s acquisition of alcatel s telecommunications manufacturing operations in liverpool  australia  also contributed to our sales increase in the region 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal resulted primarily from increased demand from personal computer customers and from networking business transferred from milpitas  california 
technology solutions our technology solutions group consists of smart and force  subsidiaries of solectron 
this business unit was formed on november  coinciding with the merger of smart 
our main products in technology solutions group are specialty and standard memory products  pc cards  embedded computer modules and communications card products 
net sales for fiscal years  and were billion  billion and million  respectively 
the increase in fiscal of over fiscal resulted from an overall increase in standard memory products incorporated with average memory densities  as well as an increase in embedded computer modules and communications card products 
the increase of in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to an increase in sales of standard memory products  communications card products and embedded computer modules 
global services our global services group was established in june it was formed through three business acquisitions  sequel in july  nulogix in november and americom in april  as well as a small division of solectron in milpitas 
net sales were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
international sites net sales from our international sites  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  have grown over the last three fiscal years 
international locations contributed of consolidated net sales in fiscal  compared with in fiscal and in fiscal as a result of our international sales and facilities  our operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad 
while these dynamics have not materially harmed our results of operations  we cannot assure that there will not be such an impact in the future 
major customers only four major customers accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  and  as summarized in the following table 
years ended august  ericsson compaq cisco hp net sales less than our top ten customers accounted for of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal we depend on continued revenues from ericsson  compaq  cisco  hp  ibm and our other top ten customers 
we cannot guarantee that these or any other customers will not increase or decrease as a percentage of consolidated net sales either individually or as a group 
consequently  any material decrease in sales to these or other customers could materially harm solectron s results of operations 
we believe that our ability to continue growing depends on increasing sales to existing customers for their current and future product generations  successfully marketing to new customers and expanding geographically 
customer contracts can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of delayed  canceled or reduced orders with new business cannot be assured 
in addition  we cannot assure that our current customers will continue to utilize our services 
because of these factors  we cannot assure that solectron s historical revenue growth rate will continue 
gross profit our gross margin percentages were  and respectively  for fiscal  and the decrease in fiscal over fiscal was attributed primarily to sales derived from lower margin mobile telecommunication equipment  manufacturing inefficiencies due to non linearity of material receipts  a high level of business development activities and new site integration support expenditures  as well as capacity ramp up for future demand growth 
the decrease in fiscal over was due to lower margins from sales derived from systems build projects and lower margin standard memory products 
our start up operations also contributed to the decrease 
in addition  the amortization of intellectual property resulting from certain acquisitions reduced gross margins 
for our worldwide manufacturing operations  we anticipate a larger percentage of our sales may be derived from systems build projects that generally yield lower profit margins than pcb assembly 
we expect most of our technology solutions sales may continue to be derived from turn key projects  which typically yield lower profit margins than consignment projects 
in addition  factors affecting technology solutions profit margins include the sales mix of specialty memory modules  standard memory modules  communication card products and embedded computer modules  as well as changes in average memory densities used in memory products 
currently  a significant amount of net sales is derived from the sales of standard memory modules  which typically have lower profit margins than specialty memory modules 
in the foreseeable future  our overall gross margin will depend primarily on product mix  production efficiencies  utilization of manufacturing capacity  start up and integration costs of new and acquired businesses  percentage of sales derived from systems build and turn key projects  pricing within the electronics industry  component costs and delivery linearity  and the cost structure at individual sites 
over time  gross margins at the individual sites and for solectron as a whole may continue to fluctuate 
increases in the systems build business or turn key projects  additional costs associated with new projects  and price erosion within the electronics industry could harm our gross margin 
in addition  we have experienced component shortages 
while the component availability fluctuates from time to time and is still subject to lead time and other constraints  this could possibly have a negative impact on our sales and gross margins for the foreseeable future 
therefore  we cannot assure that our gross margin will not fluctuate or decrease in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars  our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal  and in fiscal over fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to was contributed by an increase in head count and information systems costs to support our sales growth and increased costs of acquisition related activities 
the absolute dollar increase in fiscal over fiscal primarily reflected expenses associated with increased head count necessary to support sales growth and business infrastructure and further development costs of information systems  as well as expenses related to business and asset acquisitions 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the primary reasons for the fiscal and decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales were the significant increase in sales volume and our continued effort to manage operating expenses  partially offset by the costs associated with investments in our business infrastructure  information systems and start up costs for new sites 
we anticipate sg a expenses will continue to increase in terms of absolute dollars in the future and may possibly increase as a percentage of net sales as we continue to develop the infrastructure necessary to support our current and prospective business 
research and development expenses with the exception of our technology solutions business unit  our research and development r d activities have primarily supported the development of prototype and engineering design capabilities  fine pitch interconnecting technologies which include ball grid array  tape automated bonding  multichip modules  chip on flex  chip on board and flip chip  high reliability environmental stress test technology and the implementation of environmentally friendly assembly processes such as voc free and no clean 
technology solutions r d efforts are concentrated on new product development and improvement of product designs through improvements in functionality and the use of microprocessors in embedded applications 
in absolute dollars  r d expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal and in fiscal over fiscal the increases in absolute dollars in r d expenses were primarily due to our increased r d effort in technology solutions and new r d projects initiated at our various sites 
we expect that r d expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future and may increase as a percentage of net sales as smart and force continue to invest in their r d efforts and additional r d projects are undertaken at certain sites 
as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses were for both fiscal and  in fiscal acquisition and restructuring costs a one time charge for acquisition costs of approximately million was incurred in fiscal as a result of the acquisitions of smart  americom and bluegum during fiscal our acquisition costs consist of investment banker fees  legal fees  accounting fees  registration fees and other incidentals 
we recorded restructuring costs of approximately million in fiscal primarily related to the consolidations of certain facilities acquired in the smart and sequel mergers 
approximately million related to lease exit costs  million related to asset write offs and other incidental costs  million related to severance costs and million related to other related costs 
approximately million remains in accrued expenses as of august  and we expect to utilize these reserves by the end of fiscal net interest income expense net interest income was million in fiscal compared to in fiscal  and net interest expense of million in fiscal the net interest income in fiscal was attributed primarily to interest income earned on cash and investments from the proceeds of the zero coupon convertible senior notes which were issued in may  offset partially with interest expense on the and yield zero coupon convertible senior notes as well as on the senior notes 
the net interest expense in fiscal was related to interest expenses from the yield zero coupon convertible senior notes and the convertible subordinated notes 
the net interest income in fiscal was primarily due to the proceeds from smart s secondary public offering of common stock completed during september income taxes income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  primarily due to increased income before income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal in general  the effective income tax rate is largely a function of the balance between income from domestic and international operations 
solectron s international operations  taken as a whole  have been taxed at a lower rate than those in the united states  primarily due to the tax holiday granted to solectron s sites in malaysia 
the malaysian tax holiday is effective through january   subject to some conditions  including certain levels of research and development expenditures 
solectron has also been granted various tax holidays in china  which are effective for various terms and are subject to some conditions 
liquidity and capital resources our net working capital was billion at august   compared to billion at august  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were billion at august   an increase of billion from august  the increase was primarily due to proceeds of billion from the zero coupon convertible senior debt issued in may partially offset by investing activities  including purchases of manufacturing assets of billion and capital expenditures of billion 
accounts receivable increased million during fiscal the increase was due to growth in total sales 
inventories increased billion during fiscal the increase in inventory levels resulted from our sales growth  inventory from incomplete kits on hand caused by shortages of certain components  and purchased inventory through asset acquisitions 
we continuously manage our inventory levels striving to maintain competitive lead times while balancing the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
as of august   we had available a million unsecured multicurrency revolving line of credit that expires on april  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at either the bank s prime rate  the london interbank offering rate libor plus a margin  or the bank s certificate of deposit cd rate plus a margin 
the margin under the libor or cd rate options will vary depending on solectron s standard poor s corporation and or moody s investor services  inc rating for its long term senior unsecured debt 
this margin was at august  under the credit agreement  we must meet certain financial covenants 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit as of august  in addition  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in committed and uncommitted foreign lines of credit and other bank facilities as of august  borrowings were payable on demand 
the interest rates ranged from the bank s prime lending rate to the bank s prime rate plus 
as of august   borrowings and guaranteed amounts under committed and uncommitted foreign lines of credit were million and million  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate was for committed and for uncommitted foreign lines of credit 
under these lines of credit agreements  we must meet certain financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all of its line of credit financial covenants as of august  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  line of credit  and cash generated from operations coupled with the anticipated proceeds from our proposed common stock and lyons offerings  will satisfy our expected working capital  capital expenditure  and investment requirements through at least the next months 
year issues to date  we have not experienced any material year related issues  and we expect minimal future year issues based on the performance to date of our internal systems and external systems including  without limitation  vendor  customer and banking systems upon which we are dependent  along with the products we sell 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as amended by sfas no 
and  sfas no 
establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
we anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we will adopt sfas no 
in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec and was effective the first fiscal quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  and requires companies to report any changes in revenue recognition as a cumulative change in accounting principle at the time of implementation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  accounting changes 
subsequently  sab no 
a and b were issued to delay the implementation of sab no 
it will be effective for solectron in our fourth quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  sab no 
will have on our financial position or results and operations 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 stock issued to employees 
interpretation no 
clarifies the application of apb no 
for the definition of an employee for purposes of applying apb no 
 the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
the interpretation was adopted by solectron effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  this interpretation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we adopted the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 reporting on the costs of start up activities  on september  this statement required that costs of start up activities and organizational costs be expensed as incurred 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change on years prior to fiscal was a charge of million net of million income tax effect  or 
per common share  that was reflected in the first quarter of fiscal pro forma information is not presented as the change did not have a material impact on any individual year prior to fiscal recent developments in october  we entered into an agreement with sony corporation sony to acquire certain assets associated with two sony manufacturing facilities sony nakaniida corporation in miyagi  japan  and sony industry taiwan in kaohsiung  taiwan 
these facilities currently produce high end consumer products such as automobile satellite navigation systems  car audio systems and lithium ion battery packs 
the agreement will result in sony outsourcing its electronic manufacturing services to us from these two facilities 
on october   we signed a definitive agreement to commence an offer to purchase all outstanding shares of nel for per share in cash  representing a total transaction value  including debt of nel  of approximately billion 
nel provides global contract manufacturing services for oems in the electronics industry 
nel manufactures pcb assemblies  and provides box building capabilities and pre and post manufacturing services such as design  prototyping  testing and logistics 
we have received irrevocable undertakings  representing approximately percent of nel s outstanding common shares  from major shareholders to tender their shares under the offer 
those shares are held by the largest shareholder of nel  separately traded natsteel ltd 
nsl  key members of nel s management team  and temasek capital 
temasek holdings and other key shareholders of nsl  who collectively hold approximately percent of nsl s outstanding shares  have irrevocably undertaken to vote their shares in favor of nsl tendering its nel shares in the offer 
notwithstanding the fact that we have signed a definitive agreement and have received undertakings from nel s major shareholders  the offer is subject to several conditions  including the tender of more than percent of nel s shares on a fully diluted basis to solectron pursuant to the offer  the approval of nel s shareholders to sell its shares in nel to solectron pursuant to the offer as well as the satisfactory completion of all relevant regulatory reviews and approvals and all other customary conditions 
thus  there can be no assurance that the acquisition will close as contemplated  if at all 
in addition  we may not receive the tender of at least percent of the shares of nel 
if we are unable to purchase at least percent of the shares of nel in the tender offer  we may find it more difficult to fully integrate and operate the nel business 
we currently estimate that the acquisition of nel will reduce our diluted earnings per share for fiscal but will increase our diluted earnings per share on a cash basis for fiscal our earnings per share on a cash basis are expected to be between and for fiscal compared to for fiscal cash basis earnings per share represents net income per share adjusted for amortization of goodwill  intellectual property costs and other intangible costs  and one time charges 
the actual impact of the acquisition on our earnings will depend on a number of factors  including the terms of the financing of the acquisition  the timing of the acquisition and our actual results and the actual results of the nel operations during the period following the acquisition 
these forward looking statements involve risk and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from these statements 
on november   we filed prospectus supplements to raise approximately billion through concurrent offerings of primary shares of our common stock and year liquid yield option notes lyons 
the lyons would be zero coupon senior notes convertible into our common stock 
the common stock and lyons would be offered under our shelf registration that was declared effective april  we intend to use the net proceeds from these offerings for funding the further expansion of our business and strategic acquisitions  including approximately billion to fund the pending acquisition of nel 
in the event the acquisition of nel is not consummated or to the extent we are unable to purchase at least percent of the shares of nel  the anticipated proceeds from our proposed offering will be used  in whole or in part  as the case may be  for other strategic opportunities and other corporate purposes 
there can be no assurance that such alternative uses of capital will result in returns to solectron equal to those anticipated to result from the nel transaction 
risk factors a majority of our net sales comes from a small number of customers  if we lose any of these customers  our net sales could decline significantly 
a majority of our annual net sales comes from a small number of our customers 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal and approximately and  of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
since we are dependent upon continued net sales from our ten largest customers  any material delay  cancellation or reduction of orders from these or other major customers could cause our net sales to decline significantly 
some of these customers individually account for more than ten percent of our annual net sales 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain any of our ten largest customers or any other accounts 
in addition  our customers may materially reduce the level of services ordered from us at any time 
this could cause a significant decline in our net sales and we may not be able to reduce the accompanying expenses at the same time 
moreover  our business  financial condition and results of operations will continue to depend in significant part on our ability to obtain orders from new customers  as well as on the financial condition and success of our customers 
therefore  any adverse factors affecting any of our customers or their customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our long term contracts do not include minimum purchase requirements 
although we have long term contracts with a few of our top ten customers  including ericsson  ibm and nortel under which these customers are obligated to obtain services from us  they are not obligated to purchase any minimum amount of services 
as a result  we cannot guarantee that we will receive any net sales from these contracts 
in addition  these customers with whom we have long term contracts may materially reduce the level of services ordered at any time 
this could cause a significant decline in our net sales  and we may not be able to reduce our accompanying expenses at the same time 
possible fluctuation of operating results from quarter to quarter could affect the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly earnings may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors including the following differences in the profitability of the types of manufacturing services we provide 
for example  high velocity and low complexity pcb and systems assembly services have lower gross margins than low volume complex pcb and systems assembly services  our ability to maximize the hours of use of our equipment and facilities is dependent on the duration of the production run time for each job and customer  the amount of automation that we can use in the manufacturing process for cost reduction varies  depending upon the complexity of the product being made  our ability to optimize the ordering of inventory as to timing and amount to avoid holding inventory in excess of immediate production needs  fluctuations in demand for our services or the products being manufactured  fluctuations in the availability and pricing of components  timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  cyclicality in our target markets  and expenses associated with acquisitions 
therefore  our operating results in the future could be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock could be harmed 
we depend upon the electronics industry  which continually produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles  our inability to continually manufacture such products on a cost effective basis would harm our business 
a majority of our net sales is to companies in the electronics industry  which is subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
if our customers are unable to create products that keep pace with the changing technological environment  our customers products could become obsolete and the demand for our services could decline significantly 
if we are unable to offer technologically advanced  cost effective  quick response manufacturing services to customers  demand for our services will also decline 
in addition  a substantial portion of our net sales is derived from our ability to offer complete service solutions for our customers 
for example  if we fail to maintain high quality design and engineering services  our net sales would significantly decline 
for our technology solutions business  we have experienced  and may in the future experience  delays from time to time in the development and introduction of new products 
moreover  we cannot assure that we will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or enhancements 
we cannot assure that defects or errors will not be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments  which could result in the delay in market acceptance of such products 
the inability to introduce new products or enhancements could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on limited or sole source of suppliers for critical components 
the inability to obtain sufficient components as required would cause sales reductions 
we are dependent on certain suppliers  including limited and sole source suppliers  to provide key components used in our products 
we have experienced and may continue to experience delays in component deliveries  which could cause delays in product shipments and require the redesign of certain products 
also for our technology solutions business  we are dependent upon certain limited or sole source suppliers for critical components used for our memory module  communications card and embedded computer products 
the electronics industry has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  shortages in semiconductor devices  including dram  sram  flash memory  tantalum capacitors and other commodities that may be caused by such conditions as overall market demand surges or supplier production capacity constraints 
except for certain commodity parts  we generally have no written agreements with our suppliers 
we cannot assure that we will receive adequate component supplies on a timely basis in the future 
the inability to continue to obtain sufficient components as required  or to develop alternative sources if required  could cause delays  disruptions or reductions in product shipments or require product redesigns which could damage relationships with current or prospective customers  thereby causing sales reductions 
we potentially bear the risk of price increases associated with potential shortages in the availability of electronics components 
at various times  there have been shortages of components in the electronics industry 
one of the services that we perform for many customers is purchasing electronics components used in the manufacturing of the customers products 
as a result of this service  we potentially bear the risk of price increases for these components because we are unable to purchase components at the pricing level anticipated to support the margins assumed in our agreements with our customers 
our net sales could decline if our competitors provide comparable manufacturing services and improved products at a lower cost 
we compete with different contract manufacturers  depending on the type of service we provide or the geographic locale of our operations 
the memory module  communications card and embedded computer subsystem industries are also intensely competitive 
these competitors may have greater manufacturing  financial  r d and or marketing resources than we have 
in addition  we may not be able to offer prices as low as some of our competitors because those competitors may have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide 
our inability to provide comparable or better manufacturing services at a lower cost than our competitors could cause our net sales to decline 
we also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services  to reduce their current products or service sales prices and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing 
any of these could cause a decline in sales  loss of market acceptance of our products or services  or profit margin compression 
we depend on the memory module product market 
most of our technology solutions net sales is derived from memory modular products 
the market for these products is characterized by frequent transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards 
a failure to develop products with required feature sets or performance standards or a delay as short as a few months in bringing a new product to market could reduce our net sales which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the market for semiconductor memory devices has been cyclical 
the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and excess production 
in the past  there have been significant declines in the prices for dram  sram and flash 
such occurrences will reduce our profit 
we depend on the continuing trend of outsourcing by oems 
a substantial factor in our revenue growth is attributable to the transfer of manufacturing and supply base management activities from our oem customers 
future growth is partially dependent on new outsourcing opportunities 
to the extent that these opportunities are not available  our future growth would be unfavorably impacted 
these outsourcing opportunities may include the transfer of assets such as facilities  equipment and inventory 
if we are unable to manage our rapid growth and assimilate new operations in a cost effective manner  our profitability could decline 
we have experienced rapid growth over many years 
our historical growth may not continue 
in recent years we have established operations in different locations throughout the world 
for example  in fiscal  we opened offices in taipei  taiwan  tel aviv  israel  norrkoping and stockholm  sweden  and commenced manufacturing operations in guadalajara  mexico  suzhou  china  and timisoara  romania 
also in fiscal  we acquired foreign facilities in sao paulo  brazil and dublin  ireland 
furthermore  through acquisitions in fiscal and  we acquired facilities in duluth  georgia  columbia  south carolina  memphis  tennessee  and enhanced our capabilities in charlotte  north carolina  austin  texas  and milpitas  california 
in fiscal  we completed acquisitions of americom  smart  and bluegum that were each accounted for as a pooling of interests 
through additional acquisitions  we also acquired foreign facilities in aguadilla  puerto rico  monterrey  mexico  calgary  canada  longuenesse  france  ostersund  sweden  cwmcarn  wales  pont de buis and douarnenez  france  monkstown  northern ireland  liverpool  new south wales  wangaratta and melbourne  victoria  and sydney and north melbourne  australia 
on october  we signed a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets associated with two sony corporation manufacturing facilities  sony nakaniida corporation in miyagi  japan and sony industries taiwan in kaohsiung  taiwan 
on october  we signed a definitive agreement to commence an offer to purchase all outstanding shares of nel 
since we have been significantly expanding our operations  the growth has resulted in a significant increase in responsibility for existing management which has placed  and may continue to place  a heavy strain on our personnel and management  manufacturing and other resources 
our ability to manage the expansion to date  as well as any future expansion  will require progressive increases in manufacturing capacity  as well as enhancements or upgrades of accounting and other internal management systems and the implementation of a variety of procedures and controls 
we cannot assure that significant problems in these areas will not occur 
any failure to enhance or expand these systems and implement such procedures and controls in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with our business activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
also  in order to achieve anticipated revenue and other financial performance targets  we will continue to be required to manage our assets and operations efficiently 
in addition  should we continue to expand geographically  we may experience certain inefficiencies from the management of geographically dispersed facilities 
as we manage and continue to expand new operations  we may incur substantial infrastructure and working capital costs 
if we do not achieve sufficient growth to offset increased expenses associated with rapid expansion  our profitability will decline 
we need to successfully integrate our acquisitions to maintain profitability 
as we expand our operations through acquisitions and continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may pursue additional acquisitions over time 
these acquisitions involve risks  including integration and management of the operations  retention of key personnel  integration of purchasing operations and information systems  retention of the customer base of acquired businesses  management of an increasingly larger and more geographically disparate business  and diversion of management s attention from other ongoing business concerns 
our profitability will suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage recent acquisitions and pending acquisitions including  in particular  the nel transaction  as well as any future acquisitions that we might pursue  or if we do not achieve sufficient revenue to offset the increased expenses associated with these acquisitions 
in the event we are unable to acquire at least percent of nel in the tender offer  we may find it more difficult to integrate and operate the nel business 
the acquisition of nel may not occur and we may not be able to purchase at least percent of the shares of nel in the tender offer 
on october   we signed a definitive agreement to commence an offer to purchase all outstanding shares of nel 
nel provides global contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers oems in the electronics industry 
the company manufactures printed circuit board pcb assemblies  and provides box building capabilities and pre and post manufacturing services such as design  prototyping  testing and logistics 
solectron has received irrevocable undertakings  representing approximately percent of nel s outstanding common shares  from major shareholders to tender their shares under the offer 
those shares are held by the largest shareholder of nel  separately traded nsl  key members of nel s management team  and temasek capital 
temasek holdings and other key shareholders of nsl  who collectively hold approximately percent of nsl s outstanding shares  have irrevocably undertaken to vote their shares in favor of nsl tendering its nel shares in the tender offer 
notwithstanding the fact that we have signed a definitive agreement and have received undertakings from nel s major shareholders  the offer is subject to several conditions  including the tender of more than percent of nel s shares on a fully diluted basis to solectron pursuant to the offer  the approval of nsl shareholders to sell its shares in nel to solectron pursuant to the offer as well as the satisfactory completion of all relevant regulatory reviews and approvals and all other customary conditions 
thus  there can be no assurance that the acquisition will close as contemplated  if at all 
in addition  we may not receive the tender of at least percent of the shares of nel 
if we are unable to purchase at least percent of the shares of nel in the tender offer  we may find it more difficult to fully integrate and operate the nel business 
in the event the acquisition of nel is not consummated or to the extent we are unable to purchase at least percent of the shares of nel  the anticipated proceeds from our proposed offering will be used  in whole or in part  as the case may be  for other strategic opportunities and other corporate purposes 
there can be no assurance that such alternative uses of capital will result in returns to solectron equal to those anticipated to result from the nel transaction 
our non us locations are a significant and growing portion of our net sales  we are increasingly exposed to risks associated with operating internationally 
in fiscal  approximately of net sales came from sites outside the united states  while approximately of net sales came from sites outside the united states in fiscal as a result of our foreign sales and facilities  our operations are subject to a variety of risks that are unique to international operations  including the following adverse movement of foreign currencies against the us dollar in which our results are reported  import and export duties  and value added taxes  import and export regulation changes that could erode our profit margins or restrict exports  potential restrictions on the transfer of funds  inflexible employee contracts in the event of business downturns  and the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws 
in addition  we have operations in several locations in emerging or developing economies that have a potential for higher risk 
the risks associated with these economies include but are not limited to currency volatility  and other economic or political risks 
in the future  these factors may harm our results of operations 
solectron locations in emerging or developing economies include mexico  brazil  china  malaysia and romania 
as of august   we recorded million in cumulative foreign exchange translation losses on our balance sheet which was primarily due to the devaluation of the brazilian real 
while  to date  these factors have not had a significant adverse impact on our results of operations  we cannot assure that there will not be such an impact 
furthermore  while we may adopt measures to reduce the impact of losses resulting from volatile currencies and other risks of doing business abroad  we cannot assure that such measures will be adequate 
the malaysian government adopted currency exchange controls  including controls on its currency  the ringgit  held outside malaysia  and established a fixed exchange rate for the ringgit against the us dollar 
the fixed exchange rate provides a stable rate environment when applied to local expenses denominated in ringgit 
the long term impact of such controls is not predictable due to dynamic economic conditions that also affect or are affected by other regional or global economies 
nel currently benefits from tax holidays in singapore and indonesia 
in the event the acquisition of nel is completed  it is possible that the tax holidays will be terminated or modified or that future tax holidays will not be granted  in each case as a result of the acquisition transaction or otherwise  and that the effective income tax rate for nel s business would likely increase as a result thereof 
we have been granted a tax holiday which is effective through january   subject to some conditions  for our malaysian sites 
we have also been granted various tax holidays in china 
these tax holidays are effective for various terms and are subject to some conditions 
it is possible that the current tax holidays will be terminated or modified or that future tax holidays that we may seek will not be granted 
if the current tax holidays are terminated or modified  or if additional tax holidays are not granted in the future  our effective income tax rate would likely increase 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our policy is to hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that substantially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
presently  we use foreign currency borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges 
as of august   the majority of the foreign currency hedging contracts were scheduled to mature in less than three months and there were no material deferred gains or losses 
in addition  our international operations in some instances act as a natural hedge because both operating expenses and a portion of sales are denominated in local currency 
in these instances  including our current experience involving the devaluation of the brazilian real  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of a foreign currency against the us dollar will result in lower sales when translated to us dollars  operating expenses will also be lower in these circumstances 
also  since less than of our net sales are denominated in currencies other than us dollar  we do not believe out total exposure to be significant 
we have currency exposures arising from both sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our sites 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the currency of the exposure and the functional currency of our site could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  and if we price our products and services in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products and services in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency 
we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time  maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
as of august   approximately of our total portfolio was scheduled to mature in less than six months 
in addition  our investments are diversified and of relatively short maturity 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our investment portfolios 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by calendar year of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of august  total fair value amounts in millions cash equivalents and short term investments    average interest rate we have entered into an interest rate swap transaction under which we pay a fixed rate of interest hedging against the variable interest rates implicit in the rent charged by the lessor for the facility lease at milpitas  california 
the interest rate swap expires in the year  which coincides with the maturity date of the lease term 
as we intend to hold the interest rate swap until the maturity date  we are not subject to market risk 
in fact  such interest rate swap has fixed the interest rate for the facility lease  thus reducing interest rate risk 
our long term debt instruments are subject to fixed interest rates 
in addition  the amount of principal to be repaid at maturity is also fixed 
in the case of the convertible notes  such notes are based on fixed conversion ratios into common stock 
therefore  we are not exposed to variable interest rates related to our long term debt instruments 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  and we could become involved in intellectual property disputes 
our ability to effectively compete may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information 
we hold a number of patents and other license rights 
these patent and license rights may not provide meaningful protection for our manufacturing processes and equipment innovations 
on june   we were served  along with other companies including smart  as a defendant in a lawsuit brought by the lemelson medical  education research foundation 
the lawsuit alleges that we have infringed certain of the plaintiff s patents relating to machine vision and bar code technology 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to these allegations and do not expect that this litigation will result in a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in the semiconductor  computer  telecommunications and networking industries  companies receive notices from time to time alleging infringement of patents  copyrights  or other intellectual property rights  and litigation sometimes arises out of such notices 
for example  in january of this year  smart filed a lawsuit seeking to have declared invalid  and or not infringed  three patents purportedly applicable to industry standard memory products  including those manufactured by smart and the other manufacturers of these industry standard memory products 
the owner of these patents brought a cross complaint alleging patent infringement against smart  and has also brought suit against several other memory product manufacturers alleging infringement of the three patents 
we believe that smart s memory products do not infringe any valid claims of any of the three patents at issue 
moreover  we have been and may from time to time continue to be notified of claims that we may be infringing patents  copyrights or other intellectual property rights owned by other third parties 
the current litigation or any other litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the future  third parties may assert infringement claims against us or our customers 
in the event of an infringement claim  we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop a non infringing alternative or to obtain licenses 
we may not be successful in developing such an alternative or obtaining a license on reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  any such litigation could be lengthy and costly and could harm our financial condition 
failure to comply with environmental regulations could harm our business 
as a company in the electronics manufacturing services industry  we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process 
although we have never sustained any significant loss as a result of non compliance with such regulations  any failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant costs to comply with regulations 
our stock price may be volatile due to factors outside of our control 
our stock price could fluctuate due to the following factors  among others announcements of operating results and business conditions by our customers  announcements by our competitors relating to new customers or technological innovation or new services  economic developments in the electronics industry as a whole  political and economic developments in countries in which we have operations  and general market conditions 
failure to retain key personnel and skilled associates could hurt our operations 
our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical associates 
losing the services of key personnel could harm us 
our business also depends upon our ability to continue to attract and retain senior managers and skilled associates 
failure to do so could harm our operations 
our anti takeover defense provisions may deter potential acquirors and may depress our stock price 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of solectron 
these provisions allow us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock and impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for our stockholders to effect certain corporate actions
