item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
general liquidity considerations 
our financial statements have been presented on the basis we are a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
we are responsible for providing of the funding for the development of the karakuduk field not provided from oil sales or third party sources 
the karakuduk field will require significant additional funding in order to obtain levels of production that would generate sufficient cash flows to meet future capital and operating spending requirements 
we have recognized recurring operating losses and have a working capital deficiency as of december  in addition  there are uncertainties relating to chaparral s and kkm s ability to meet commitments under kkm s license  and all expenditure and cash flow requirements through fiscal year kkm s agreements with the government of the republic of kazakhstan require kkm to meet certain expenditure and work commitments on or before june  if kkm fails to meet these commitments  kkm s right to develop the karakuduk field may be terminated and our investment in the karakuduk field may be lost 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties 
management has taken the following actions  to address the substantial doubt with respect to our ability to remain a going concern and enhance our short and long term liquidity o shell capital loan 
in november  we entered into the loan with shell capital  to provide up to  in financing for the development of the karakuduk field 
the consummation of the loan was subject to a number of significant conditions  which were subsequently fulfilled in february as of march   we have borrowed a total of  under the loan 
o rights offering 
as a condition to the loan  we must utilize our best efforts to complete a rights offering to our stockholders to acquire not less than  of chaparral s common stock on or before june  the rights offering 
two of chaparral s related party stockholders  allen company  inc allen and whittier ventures  llc whittier  have each undertaken to exercise their full pro rata share of the rights offering and  if the rights offering is not concluded on or before june   to each contribute  to chaparral for either our common stock or indebtedness the equity support agreement 
o development of kkm s proven reserves 
kkm has approximately million barrels of estimated proven oil reserves  net of government royalty 
as of march   kkm has produced approximately  barrels of crude oil  of which  barrels of test production was sold in for total proceeds of  net of transportation and production costs 
as of march   kkm had approximately  barrels of crude oil in inventory and was producing approximately  barrels of oil per day 
capital spending for the development of the karakuduk field is expected to materially increase kkm s extraction of its proven reserves  generating significant cash flows from future oil sales to fund kkm s operations and repay our outstanding advances to kkm 
o crude oil sales agreement 
in november  kkm entered into the crude oil sales agreement with stasco  an affiliate of shell capital  for the purchase of of the oil production from the karakuduk field on the export market for world market oil prices 
kkm has currently nominated approximately  barrels of crude oil for april delivery to stasco under the terms of the crude oil sales agreement 
we expect kkm to obtain a substantially higher return from oil sales under the crude oil sales agreement than would otherwise be received from oil sales in kazakhstan s local market 
our considerations for addressing our going concern uncertainty is partially based upon forward looking events  which have yet to occur  including the successful consummation of the rights offering and the successful development  production  and sales of crude oil from the karakuduk field 
expected funding requirements necessary for development of the karakuduk field through december  are partially based upon future cash flows from the sale of kkm s crude oil production 
these risks are partially mitigated by the current funding available under the loan  along with the equity support agreement for a  capital infusion into chaparral in the event the rights offering is not completed by june  other risks and considerations also impact our short and long term liquidity  including the result of the proposed conversion of our notes into our common stock  kkm s ability to successfully develop and increase production from the karakuduk field  kkm s ability to obtain export oil quota and physically deliver its production to the export market  volatility of oil prices on the world market  our oil production hedge arrangements  and the impact of kkm s license commitments to the government of the republic of kazakhstan

if the conversion feature is approved  the notes will convert into the equivalent shares of our common stock within business days following the stockholder vote 
the failure of the stockholders to approve the conversion provision of the notes will result in an immediate increase of the annual interest rate payable to the lesser of or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law

in the event coverage under shell capital s policy is triggered  proceeds from the policy would go to the benefit of chaparral for use in making principal and interest payments required under the loan 
the  payment for the beneficial interest in shell capital s transportation risk insurance covers the life of the loan discussed below

the terms and conditions and related financing costs of the loan are significant 
a substantial portion of our future cash flow from operations will be required for debt service and may not be available for other purposes 
our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  or acquisitions is also restricted  as well as our ability to acquire or dispose of significant assets or investments 
these restrictions may make us more vulnerable and less able to react to adverse economic conditions 
the failure of chaparral to meet the terms of the loan could result in an event of default and the loss of our investment in the karakuduk field 
the loan prohibits us from paying dividends to our stockholders without shell capital s consent 
we have not paid dividends in the past and have no expectations to do so in the future 
as of march   we have borrowed  under the loan 
the loan proceeds were utilized to pay  in outstanding debt issuance costs   for the hedge agreement   for transportation risk insurance   for the initial opic insurance premium   for kkm s operations  and  for our corporate overhead 
other sources of liquidity and capital resources 
we expect to draw additional funds from the loan to support kkm s development of the karakuduk field 
the costs required to develop the karakuduk field are significant and will not be fully covered by the available financial resources under the loan 
we are currently pursuing additional sources of liquidity  which we believe will satisfy both the short and long term liquidity requirements of both chaparral and kkm  including the conversion of the notes into our common stock  the rights offering  and the sale of oil under the crude oil sales agreement 
we are currently preparing a proxy statement to our stockholders  including a proposal to approve the conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock at per share 
the conversion of the notes would decrease our indebtedness by  plus accrued interest 
if the notes are not converted  they will accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the lesser of or the maximum rate allowed by law 
the notes are fully subordinated to the loan  and cannot be repaid until we have fully repaid the loan 
our board of directors has approved a rights offering for  shares of our common stock convertible at per share  or  the board of directors set the record date after the date of our annual meeting in order to permit the holders of the notes to participate in the rights offering 
under the terms of the equity support agreement  allen and whittier have undertaken to exercise their full pro rata share of the rights offering  which will be approximately  assuming conversion of the notes  plus accrued interest  into our common stock 
if the rights offering is not completed prior to june   allen and whittier will contribute an aggregate of  in exchange for our equity securities or indebtedness 
kkm has nominated its first sale under the crude oil sales agreement for approximately  barrels of oil 
delivery is expected in april  with payment received in may based on current market prices  net proceeds from the sale would equal approximately  to kkm 
additional oil sales are expected on at least a quarterly basis  as kkm works to increase production 
while we fully expect to realize material cash benefits from some  or all  of the above transactions  we can provide no assurances that the rights offering  equity support agreement  conversion of the notes  or sales under the crude oil sales agreement will be consummated 
if we fail to raise additional financial resources in the short term  through internal or external means  we may be unable to meet operational cash flow requirements or meet the terms of the loan 
if so  we may lose our investment in kkm and the karakuduk field 
capital commitments under the terms of the license from the government of the republic of kazakhstan  kkm was committed to minimum expenditures of  for the year ended december  the license also establishes a minimum work program requiring kkm to drill new wells during in august  we received a letter from the state investment agency of the republic of kazakhstan the sia letter  extending the period for completion of the minimum work program and expenditure commitments to june  the sia letter is not a formal amendment to the license 
as of march   kkm will need to drill an additional new wells and invest an additional  prior to june  to satisfy the terms of the sia letter 
kkm has one rig running currently and is expecting to place a second rig under contract in the near future 
there is a possibility  however  that kkm will not meet the work commitment to drill additional wells before june  if kkm fails to satisfy the work or capital commitment under the license or sia letter  the licensing authority could cancel or suspend the license 
if the license is cancelled  we will be unable to develop and sell oil produced from the karakuduk field  and we will have no other source of oil revenue 
we believe the licensing authority will not suspend or cancel the license  but we can provide no assurances that the license would not be revoked or suspended if the license requirements are not satisfied 
kkm can request a deferral of the license commitments  but there is no guarantee that the licensing authority will grant a deferral 
commodity prices for oil our revenues  profitability  growth and value are highly dependent upon the price of oil 
market conditions make it difficult to estimate prices of oil or the impact of inflation on such prices 
oil prices have been volatile  and it is likely they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
various factors beyond our control affect prices for oil  including supplies of oil available worldwide and in kazakhstan  the ability of opec to agree to maintain oil prices and production controls  political instability or armed conflict in kazakhstan or other oil producing regions  the price of foreign imports  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the availability of transportation routes and pipeline capacity  and changes in applicable laws and regulations 
inflation we cannot control prices received from our oil sales and to the extent we are unable to pass on increases in operating costs  we may be affected by inflation 
on april   the government of the republic of kazakhstan discontinued its support of the tenge and allowed it to float freely against the us dollar 
immediately thereafter  the official exchange rate declined from tenge to the us dollar to tenge to the us dollar  but was relatively stable for the remainder of the devaluation decreased the us dollar realizable value of any tenge denominated monetary assets held by kkm  and decreased the us dollar obligation of any tenge denominated monetary liabilities held by kkm 
kkm maintains its financial statements in us dollars and the impact of the devaluation is not considered to be material at this time 
year update there were no significant disruptions in either chaparral s or kkm s operations due to the year date change 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our operations or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters are addressed promptly 
results from operations we account for our investment in kkm using the equity method 
in  the fasb released eitf  percentage used to determine the amount of equity method losses  which requires investors to recognize equity method losses beyond their percentage of investee common stock to the extent of their adjusted basis in the investee s common stock and other loans advances made to the investee 
future equity method gains  if any  would be recaptured by the investor to the extent disproportionate equity method losses were recognized in prior periods 
eitf is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after september  we have elected to apply eitf prospectively beginning in the quarter ended december  as a result  we recognized an additional equity loss of  in due to the application of eitf see note to our consolidated financial statement for the year ended december  the conversion feature of the notes represent a beneficial conversion feature as addressed in eitf  accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios 
under eitf  a portion of the proceeds received from the notes is allocable to the conversion feature contained therein 
the value assigned to the conversion feature is determined as the difference between the market price of our common stock and the conversion price multiplied by the number of shares to be received upon conversion 
as the conversion price contained in the notes is substantially below the market price  the value under the above formula as of december  significantly exceeds the net carrying value of the notes 
under eitf  the portion of the proceeds allocable to the conversion feature is limited to the total proceeds received 
accordingly  upon approval of the conversion by the stockholders  we will record total additional debt discount equal to  which is equal to the notes carrying value as of december  and the  in notes issued in january and february of the entire discount will be immediately charged to interest expense upon conversion of the notes 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  our operations during  resulted in a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  for interest income increased by  from due to increased financing of of kkm s operations in kazakhstan 
interest expense increased  in due to additional borrowings to support our corporate overhead and kkm s operations 
general and administrative costs decreased by  from primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense from a reduction in stock based compensation and the reversal of accrued compensation which was contingent on the sale of our interest in kkm 
our equity loss in kkm increased by  from  of which  was due to the increased amount of equity losses recorded from the application of eitf beginning in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  kkm stopped capitalizing interest expense and began amortization of its oil and gas properties 
in  we recorded a  loss from a settlment with challenger 
chaparral  kkm  challenger  and ogecc reached a full and final settlement in february of  whereby we will not recover the note receivable from challenger 
we recorded the charge on the settlement of this dispute as of december  in  we settled a lawsuit filed against chaparral for a total of  and warrants to purchase  shares of the our common stock at an exercise price of per share  exercisable through january  the warrants were recorded at the fair market value approximately 
in  we also recognized a  extraordinary loss on the extingushment of long term debt 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  our operations during  resulted in a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  for interest income increased by  from due to increased financing of of kkm s operations in kazakhstan 
general and administrative costs increased by  from due mainly to an increase in compensation expense and legal fees 
compensation expense increased by  primarily due to stock based compensation granted to our directors  employees  and consultants during plus amortization of prior year equity based compensation 
furthermore  our cash based compensation increased due to the hiring of additional personnel required for normal business operations 
legal fees increased  primarily relating to a lawsuit  which was settled in our equity loss in kkm  increased  from these increases are the result of kkm s increased operational activity in kazakhstan
