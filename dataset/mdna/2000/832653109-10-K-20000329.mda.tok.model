item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company has expanded its operations substantially over the past three years through a combination of acquisitions and internal growth 
operating revenue growth exceeded for the third straight year 
from to operating revenue increased  to million in from million in  while net earnings decreased  to million in from million in the company operates a tractor trailer fleet comprised of both company owned vehicles and vehicles obtained under leases from independent contractors and third party finance companies 
fluctuations among expense categories may occur as a result of changes in the relative percentage of the fleet obtained through equipment that is owned versus equipment that is leased from independent contractors or financing sources 
costs associated with revenue equipment acquired under operating leases or through agreements with independent contractors are expensed as purchased transportation 
for these categories of equipment the company does not incur costs such as interest and depreciation as it might with owned equipment 
in addition  independent contractor tractors  driver compensation  fuel  communications  and certain other expenses are borne by the independent contractors and are not incurred by the company 
obtaining equipment from independent contractors and under operating leases reduces capital expenditures and on balance sheet leverage and effectively shifts expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses 
the fleet profile of acquired companies and the company s relative recruiting and retention success with company employed drivers and independent contractors will cause fluctuations from time to time in the percentage of the company s fleet that is owned versus obtained from independent contractors and under operating leases 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to revenue for the periods indicated operating revenue operating expenses purchased transportation compensation and employee benefits fuel  supplies  and maintenance insurance and claims taxes and licenses general and administrative communication and utilities depreciation and amortization total operating expenses earnings from operations interest expense  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue increased million  to million in from million in the revenue increase resulted primarily from a increase in weighted average tractors  to  in from  during as the company expanded internally to meet customer demand and acquired the business of east west in february  tp in august  and jht in october this was partially offset by lower revenue per tractor per week excluding revenue from brokerage operations  which decreased per week  to  in from  in this decrease was caused by a shortage of manned tractors in the fleet in the second half of the year and lower miles and revenue per tractor in the dry van operations 
revenue from the company s brokerage operations increased million  to million in from million in purchased transportation consists primarily of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment  expenses related to brokerage activities  and payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
purchased transportation increased million  to million in from million in  as the company s business expanded and the company contracted with more independent contractor providers of revenue equipment 
as a percentage of revenue  purchased transportation decreased to in from in this reflects a decrease in the amount of freight brokered by the company as a percent of total revenue  a slight decrease in the percentage of the company s fleet supplied by independent contractors  and a reduction in equipment rent caused by the purchase of equipment which was previously leased 
compensation and employee benefits increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  compensation and employee benefits increased to in from in the increase was attributable to i an increase in the self insured retention for workers compensation and health insurance claims and reserve amounts for the period  ii an increase in the per mile wage paid to flatbed drivers in october  iii an increase in the number of driver trainers and trainees  and iv a slight increase in the percentage of the company s fleet supplied by company trucks 
fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  supplies  and maintenance decreased slightly to in from in in spite of a increase in fuel costs to per gallon during from per gallon in the increased fuel costs were largely offset by gains from fuel hedging transactions as well as lower costs for parts  tires  tarps  supplies  and binders 
the company is attempting to recover increases in fuel prices through fuel surcharges and higher rates  however  recent fuel price increases will not be fully offset through these measures 
going forward  the company s fuel hedging positions cover less fuel than in and expire in june insurance and claims increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance and claims increased to of revenue in compared with in  reflecting an increase in liability and physical damage claims paid and reserved 
taxes and licenses increased million  to million in from million in  reflecting an increase in the number of shipments requiring special permits and an increase in the number of tractors licensed by the company 
the special permits are paid for by the shippers  which increases freight revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  taxes and licenses remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with of revenue in general and administrative expenses increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with of revenue in communications and utilities increased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities remained unchanged at in both years 
depreciation and amortization increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization increased to of revenue in from in the increase was attributable to a larger fleet of company owned tractors and trailers  which increased the cost of the equipment being depreciated  an increase in the number of company owned tractors financed with debt rather than operating leases  and lower revenue per tractor which less efficiently spread this fixed cost 
interest expense  net  increased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  interest expense  net  remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with in as a result of the foregoing  the company s pretax margin decreased to in from in the company s effective tax rate was in of revenue  compared with in of revenue 
the effective tax rate is higher than the expected combined tax rate for a company headquartered in iowa because of the cost of nondeductible driver per diem expense absorbed by the company 
the impact of the company s paying per diem travel expenses varies depending upon the ratio of drivers to independent contractors and the level of the company s pretax earnings 
as a result of the factors described above  net earnings decreased to million in of revenue  from million in of revenue 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue increased million  to million in from million in the revenue increase resulted primarily from a increase in weighted average tractors  to  in from during as the company expanded internally to meet customer demand and acquired the business of east west in february  tp in august  and jht in october revenue per tractor per week excluding revenue from brokerage operations decreased per week  to  in from  in this resulted from a decrease in revenue per loaded mile  which was largely offset by an increase in miles per tractor and a decrease in empty miles percentage 
these changes were a result of the increase in van freight associated with the acquisition of east west 
in addition  revenue from the company s brokerage operations increased million  to million in from million in purchased transportation consists primarily of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment  expenses related to brokerage activities  and payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
purchased transportation increased million  to million in from million in  as the company s business expanded and the company contracted with more independent contractor providers of revenue equipment 
as a percentage of revenue  purchased transportation increased to in from in this reflects an increase in the percentage of the company s fleet supplied by independent contractors as a result of the company s internal recruiting efforts and the acquisition of east west  which has obtained a higher percentage of its fleet from independent contractors 
it also reflects an increase in the freight hauled by brokered equipment 
compensation and employee benefits increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  compensation and employee benefits increased to in from in the increase was attributable to i an increase in the per mile wage paid to van drivers  ii an increase in the number of driver trainers and trainees  and iii an increase in the self insured retention for health insurance claims and reserve amounts for the period  which primarily related to unusual health claims during the second quarter of fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  supplies  and maintenance decreased to in from in  reflecting a decrease in fuel costs to per gallon during from per gallon in the decrease was partially offset by an increase in the cost of parts  tires  tarps  supplies  and binders used in the company s operations 
insurance and claims increased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance and claims remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with in taxes and licenses increased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  taxes and licenses remained unchanged at of revenue for each year 
general and administrative expenses increased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenue in from in  as a result of a decrease in freight revenue being dispatched by terminal agents  resulting in less commissions paid during the period 
additionally  certain fixed costs are being spread over a larger revenue base 
communications and utilities increased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities remained unchanged at in both years 
depreciation and amortization increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization increased to of revenue in from in the increase was attributable to a larger fleet of company owned tractors and trailers  which increased the cost of the equipment being depreciated  an increase in the number of company owned tractors financed with debt rather than operating leases  slightly lower revenue per tractor  and an increase in goodwill amortization as a result of the three acquisitions in interest expense  net  increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  interest expense  net  increased to of revenue in from in  as the company incurred debt to finance the acquisition of three trucking companies 
this increase in debt was partially offset by lower average interest rates of in compared with in as a result of the foregoing  the company s pretax margin decreased to in from in the company s effective tax rate was in of revenue  compared with in of revenue 
the effective tax rate is higher than the expected combined tax rate for a company headquartered in iowa because of the cost of nondeductible driver per diem expense absorbed by the company 
the impact of the company s paying per diem travel expenses varies depending upon the ratio of drivers to independent contractors and the level of the company s pretax earnings 
as a result of the factors described above  net earnings decreased to million in of revenue  from million in of revenue 
liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business has required significant invest ments in new revenue equipment that the company has financed in recent years with borrowings under installment notes payable to commercial lending institutions and equipment manufacturers  borrowings under lines of credit  cash flow from operations  and equipment leases from third party lessors 
the company also has obtained a portion of its revenue equipment fleet from independent contractors who own and operate the equipment  which reduces overall capital expenditure requirements compared with providing a fleet of entirely company owned equipment 
the company s primary sources of liquidity currently are funds provided by operations and borrowings under credit agreements with financial institutions and equipment manufacturers 
management believes that its sources of liquidity are adequate to meet its currently anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and other needs at least through net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and respectively 
the company s principal use of cash from operations is to service debt and internally finance accounts receivable associated with growth in the business 
customer accounts receivable increased million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the average age of the company s accounts receivable was approximately days for  days for  and days for net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
such amounts related primarily to payments made in acquisitions of eight trucking companies and purchases  sales  and trades of revenue equipment 
the company expects capital expenditures primarily for revenue equipment and satellite communications units  net of revenue equipment trade ins  to be approximately million during such projected capital expenditures are expected to be funded with cash flow from operations  borrowings  or operating leases 
the company continues to evaluate the need to expand its present headquarters facility and may incur a portion of the expansion costs during the size and cost of the possible expansion has not yet been determined 
the company s projected capital expenditures do not include any amount for this possible expansion 
net cash used in provided by financing activities of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  consisted primarily of net payments borrowings of million  million  and million of principal under the company s long term debt agreements  and net payments of million in under the company s former line of credit  which was paid off during that year 
at december   the company had outstanding long term debt including current maturities of approximately million  most of which was comprised of obligations for the purchase of revenue equipment 
approximately million consisted of borrowings from financial institutions and equipment manufacturers  million represented the amount drawn under the company s revolving credit facility  and  represented future payments for purchases of intangible assets 
interest rates on this debt range from to with maturities through at december   the revolving credit facility provided for borrowings of up to million  based upon certain accounts receivable and revenue equipment values 
the interest rate under the credit facility is currently plus the libor rate for the corresponding period 
the credit facility is secured and contains covenants that impose certain minimum financial ratios and limit additional liens  the size of certain mergers and acquisitions  dividends  and other matters 
the company was in compliance with the credit facility at december  market risks the company is exposed to market risks from changes in i certain interest rates on its debt and ii certain commodity prices 
interest rate risk the revolving credit facility  provided there has been no default  carries a maximum variable interest rate of libor for the corresponding period plus 
this variable interest exposes the company to the risk that interest rates may rise 
assuming borrowing levels at december   a one point increase in the libor would increase interest expense by  most of the company s other debt carries fixed interest rates and exposes the company to the risk that interest rates may fall 
at december   approximately of the company s debt carries a variable interest rate and the remainder is fixed 
commodity price risk the company uses derivative instruments  including heating oil price swap agreements  to reduce a portion of its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
at december   the company had price swap agreements for million gallons at a fixed price of cents per gallon 
since the company s price is fixed for these gallons  changes in fuel prices would have no impact on the company s future fuel expense related to these gallons 
therefore  there is no earnings or liquidity risk associated with these price swap agreements 
the fair value of the price swap agreements is the estimated amount the company would pay or receive to terminate the swap agreements 
at december   a ten percent change in the price of heating oil would result in a  change in the current value of  which the company would receive from termination of the swap agreements 
the company does not trade in these derivatives with the objective of earning financial gains on price fluctuations  nor does it trade in these instruments when there are no underlying transaction related exposures 
inflation and fuel costs most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices  the compensation paid to drivers  and fuel prices 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company attempts to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
the failure to obtain rate increases in the future could adversely affect profitability 
high fuel prices also decrease the company s profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company attempts to pass through increases in fuel prices to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  the fuel price increases are not fully recovered 
the recent increases in fuel prices will not be fully offset through surcharges and higher rates 
seasonality in the trucking industry results of operations show a seasonal pattern because customers generally reduce shipments during the winter season  and the company experiences some seasonality due to the open  flatbed nature of the majority of its trailers 
the company at times has experienced delays in meeting its shipment schedules as a result of severe weather conditions  particularly during the winter months 
in addition  the company s operating expenses have been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs in colder weather 
year to date  the company s information and non information systems have experienced no adverse impact from the transition to the year in addition  the company is not aware of any material year related issues with any of its shippers  suppliers  or other third parties with whom it has business relationships 
through december   the company spent approximately  to address year issues 
the company does not expect to incur any significant additional costs relating to year issues 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements the company may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements 
written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the company relies on this safe harbor in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  the company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following economic factors  fuel prices 
negative economic factors such as recessions  downturns in customers business cycles  surplus inventories  inflation  and higher interest rates could impair the company s operating results by decreasing equipment utilization or increasing costs of operations 
increases in fuel prices usually are not fully recovered 
accordingly  high fuel prices can have a negative impact on the company s profitability 
resale of used revenue equipment 
the company historically has recognized a gain on the sale of its revenue equipment 
the market for used equipment weakened dramatically in late and into if the resale value of the company s revenue equipment were to remain low or decline  the company could find it necessary to dispose its equipment at a lower gain or a loss  or retain some of its equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers and independent contractors 
competition for drivers and independent contractors is intense in the trucking industry 
there is  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers and independent contractors 
this shortage could force the company to significantly increase the compensation it pays to driver employees and independent contractors or curtail the company s growth 
competition 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with other truckload carriers  private fleets operated by existing and potential customers  and to some extent railroads and rail intermodal service 
competition is based primarily on service  efficiency  and freight rates 
many competitors offer transportation service at lower rates than the company 
the company s results could suffer if it cannot obtain higher rates than competitors that offer a lower level of service 
acquisitions 
a significant portion of the company s growth since june has occurred through acquisitions 
in  management intends to concentrate on improving the profitability of its current operations and may not pursue additional acquisitions as aggressively 
accordingly  the company s revenue growth rate may suffer 
may contain forward looking statements
