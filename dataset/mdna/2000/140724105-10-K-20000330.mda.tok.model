since the company did not operate as a reit prior to  a provision for income tax has been recorded in prior years 
the provision for income tax does not bear the usual relationship to pretax income as a result of the treatment of dividends paid on the redeemable preferred stock as deductible interest expense for tax purposes 
if deduction as interest is challenged by the irs  the company could be assessed and ultimately required to pay income taxes 
the provision for income tax was  for due to an allowance recorded to reflect the company s estimate of the minimum settlement of this matter  should a claim be asserted by the irs 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s net income before income tax increased to million for as compared to million for  and net income increased to million for as compared to million for income attributable to common stock was million compared to a loss of million in liquidity and capital resources the company s principal use of funds is for property development and acquisition  payment of interest on its outstanding indebtedness and payment of operating expenses and dividends 
historically  interest expense  operating expenses and dividends have been paid out of cash flows from operations 
property acquisitions typically have been funded out of proceeds from equity offerings and borrowings 
the company expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements  which are principally property development and acquisition and scheduled debt maturities  through a variety of future sources of capital  including long term collateralized and uncollateralized indebtedness  off balance sheet financing through the formation of joint ventures  and the issuance of additional equity or debt securities 
the company s leases generally provide for specified periodic rent increases 
in addition  most of the company s leases require the lessee to pay all operating costs and expenses including repairs  maintenance  real property taxes  assessments  utilities and insurance  thereby substantially reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses 
based upon these factors  the company does not anticipate significant capital demands related to the management of its properties other than potential costs of re leasing vacant boston chicken properties which it anticipates not exceeding at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million

the company used the net proceeds of the public offering to repay million of its existing notes payable  to redeem million of the redeemable preferred stock and to pay million of accrued dividends thereon 
the remaining million of redeemable preferred stock was exchanged for  shares of the common stock 
as a result  the company s preferred stock dividend requirement has been eliminated 
joint venture 
in april  the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  formed fc venture i  llc with an affiliate of fidelity management trust company 
fc venture was formed to acquire and develop net leased restaurant and retail properties similar to those which the company acquires and develops 
fc venture s objective is to leverage its capital through borrowing to acquire and develop up to million in properties 
at december  the company had contributed million in equity capital and fc venture has invested million in properties subject to leases 
during the company received  in cash distributions from fc venture 
credit facility 
in february  the company entered into a syndicated credit facility with first union national bank  as agent  to provide funds for the acquisition and development of properties and working capital  and repaid all amounts outstanding under a prior credit facility 
on december  the company amended the credit facility to provide up to million of debt which is collateralized by the properties 
at december   the company had million of aggregate outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
the credit facility has a three year term and initially enabled the company to borrow up to million subject to certain borrowing base restrictions that are dependent on a cash basis lease revenue 
the credit facility contains covenants which  among other restrictions  require the company to maintain a minimum net worth of million  a maximum leverage ratio of  an interest coverage ratio greater than and a fixed charge coverage ratio greater than as of december  the company is in compliance with all debt covenants 
due to the filing by boston chicken  inc for chapter bankruptcy protection in october  the company was in technical violation of a financial covenant and was precluded from additional borrowings under the credit facility 
at that time the company was in negotiation with the credit facility lender regarding an amendment to prevent the violation of this covenant in the event that boston chicken chose to file for bankruptcy protection 
the credit facility lender agreed to forbear from taking any action against the company pursuant to the credit facility 
on december  the credit facility was amended as follows the facility borrowing capacity was reduced from million to million  the maximum leverage ratio was increased from to  and annual interest rate spread over libor was increased from a range of to to a range of to 
in connection with the credit facility the company incurred issuance cost of million and is also required to pay a commitment fee ranging from to per annum on the unused amount of the commitment 
commitment fees and closing expenses paid in conjunction with the credit facility have been capitalized in other assets and are being amortized under the effective interest method and classified as additional interest expense over the term of the credit facility 
the credit facility expires in february and may be renewed annually thereafter  one year in advance of maturity subject to the consent of the lender 
upon expiration  the entire outstanding balance of the credit facility will mature and become immediately due and payable 
at that time  the company expects to refinance such debt either through additional debt financings collateralized by individual properties or groups of properties  by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings or by additional equity offerings 
property acquisitions and commitments 
during the year ended december   the company developed and acquired properties for an aggregate acquisition cost of approximately million

the commitments are subject to various conditions to closing which are described in the contracts or letters of intent relating to these properties 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business the company is in negotiations regarding the proposed acquisition of other properties and related co development opportunities 
the company may enter into commitments to acquire some of these prospective properties in the future 
the company expects to finance its acquisition commitments through a variety of sources of capital  including borrowings under the credit facility  other long term collateralized and uncollateralized indebtedness  off balance sheet financing through the formation of joint ventures and the issuance of additional equity or debt securities 
property acquisition and development commitments are expected to generate the primary demand for additional capital in the future 
dividends 
during  the company paid dividends of million 
in january  the company declared a fourth quarter dividend on its common stock in the amount of per share or  the dividend was payable to shareholders of record on january  and was paid on january  the company expects to pay future dividends from cash available for distribution 
the company believes that cash from operations will be sufficient to allow the company to make distributions necessary to enable the company to continue to qualify as a reit to the extent such requirements remain applicable 
inflation the company s leases contain provisions which mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
the leases generally provide for specified periodic rent increases including fixed increase amounts and  in limited circumstances  indexation to cpi and or percentage rent 
in addition  most of the leases require the lessee to pay all operating costs and expenses including repairs  maintenance  real property taxes  assessments  utilities and insurance  thereby substantially reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company s credit facility bears interest at a variable rate which will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates and will be sensitive to inflation 
the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
year the year issue is a result of the way computer programs historically manipulate data information based on a two digit year instead of 
the issue is that the is misinterpreted as the year instead of the year as a result of the company s year efforts and the timely completion of all related projects  the company did not experience any disruption in its business operations in january in addition  the company was not adversely affected by any of its key business vendors  lessees or other partners not being year ready 
the company will continue to monitor its own operations  and the operations of third parties that are critical to the company s operations  for potential year related problems 
however  the company does not anticipate that it will discover any future year issues that will have a material impact on its business  results of operations  or financial condition 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is effective for all quarters of all fiscal years beginning after january  for the company 
the statement requires that all derivative instruments be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
management has not yet determined the impact the statement will have on its earnings or financial position

those instruments involve  to varying degrees  market risk  as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations  and elements of credit risk in the event the counterparty should default 
the company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 
at december  the company had an interest rate swap contract outstanding with a total notional amount of million  and an interest rate cap contract outstanding with a total notional amount of million 
the notional amounts serve solely as a basis for the calculation of payments to be exchanged and are not a measure of the exposure of the company through the use of derivatives

under the interest rate cap agreement the counterparty agrees to make payments to the company if the libor exceeds through july  or thereafter
