the company deployed the additional regional jet aircraft in performing operations under its code share agreements with america west and us airways 
additionally  the company continued to downsize its beechcraft d fleet  disposing of d aircraft during fiscal regional jet aircraft have more seats and generally fly longer stage lengths than turboprop aircraft 
consequently  regional jet aircraft provide more available seat miles asms and generate lower revenue and cost per asm than turboprop aircraft 
operating revenues in fiscal  operating revenues increased by million to million  compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to additional revenues from the company s expanded use of regional jets pursuant to fee per departure contracts with america west and us airways 
capacity  measured by asms  increased by to  million in fiscal  compared to  million in fiscal the increase in asms was primarily attributable to the company s continued implementation of regional jet aircraft into its fleet  which have more seats and fly longer stage lengths than turboprop aircraft 
passenger traffic is measured by revenue passenger miles rpms  which represent one revenue passenger carried one mile 
rpms increased by to  million in fiscal as compared to  million fiscal the increase in rpms was primarily due to the company s expanded use of regional jets pursuant to fee per departure contracts with america west and us airways 
passenger load factor increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the majority of the company s revenue is derived from fee per departure contracts with its major airline partners 
operating expenses flight operations in fiscal  flight operations expense increased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased fuel costs of approximately million  increased lease costs of approximately million and increased pilot wages of approximately million 
these increases were the result of operating additional regional jets which have higher operating costs than turbo prop aircraft 
maintenance expense in fiscal  maintenance expense increased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal increased maintenance expenditures are primarily due to the increased number of time sensitive maintenance events that occurred in fiscal fiscal maintenance expense was reduced by million as a result of the company s change in accounting method from the accrual method to the direct expense method for crj and dash aircraft 
the company also elected to adopt the direct expense method for its new erj aircraft 
the company estimates that the change in method will have a positive impact on earnings over the next eight years 
aircraft and traffic servicing expense in fiscal  aircraft and traffic servicing expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the company s continued down sizing of its bd fleet and the consequent reduction in flying under prorate agreements 
promotion and sales in fiscal  promotion and sales expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the company s continued down sizing of its bd fleet and the continued expansion of flights performed pursuant to contract agreements  whereby america west and us airways assume the responsibility for promoting and selling seats on flights operated by the company 
general and administrative expense in fiscal  general and administrative expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is due to merger expenses incurred in related to the acquisition of ccair as well as a decrease in legal expenses 
general and administrative expense consists of items such as administrative payroll  office rent  professional fees and other items 
depreciation and amortization in fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the cessation of depreciation on parked d aircraft being disposed  which are valued in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
other operating items in fiscal  other operating items were de minimis  while in the prior year  the company recorded substantial adjustments related to the shut down of the ual code sharing operation and the reversal of million of previously established reserves which were considered to be excess 
fiscal versus fiscal during fiscal  the company increased the number of regional jet aircraft in its fleet from to capacity  measured by asms  increased by to  million in fiscal  as compared to  million in fiscal the asm increase resulted from the company s continued implementation of regional jet aircraft into its fleet  offset by fewer d and emb aircraft associated with the united express operation 
passenger traffic  measured by rpms  decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the passenger load factor decreased from to  yield passenger revenue per rpm decreased by cents in from cents per rpm  and revenue per asm decreased to cents from cents per asm in fiscal the decrease in rpms was due primarily to the reduction in flying from the united express operations terminated in the decreases in yield and revenue per asm primarily result from mesa s aforementioned increase in regional jet flying 
operating revenues decreased by million for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to the inclusion in of revenues associated with the since terminated united express operation 
capacity  measured by asms  increased by due to the continued addition of regional jet aircraft into mesa s fleet  offset by fewer b and emb aircraft associated with the united express operation 
passenger traffic  measured by revenue passenger miles rpms and representing one passenger carried one mile  decreased by 
the passenger load factor decreased from to  yield passenger revenue per rpm decreased by cents in from cents per rpm  and revenue per asm decreased to cents from cents per asm in fiscal the decrease in rpms was due primarily to the reduction in flying from the united express operations terminated in the decreases in load factor  yield and revenue per asm primarily result from mesa s aforementioned increase in regional jet flying 
flight operations expense decreased by to million cents per asm for the fiscal year  from million cents per asm for the comparable period in  primarily due to the discontinuation of the united express operation 
flight operations expense increased as a percentage of revenue due to additional costs  primarily pilots and flight attendants  associated with regional jet aircraft 
fuel costs  pilot costs  and dispatch costs all declined for the fiscal year  as compared to the prior period 
pilot training costs also declined compared to the prior period  primarily due to the inclusion in fiscal year of a major portion of training expenses associated with integrating crj aircraft into the fleet 
maintenance costs decreased by to million cents per asm for the fiscal year  from million cents per asm for the prior year 
decreased maintenance costs are the result of a smaller fleet and the continued introduction of new  warranted crj aircraft 
aircraft and traffic servicing costs decreased by to million cents per asm during fiscal from million cents per asm in fiscal station wages decreased due to a reduction in staffing 
station rent decreased in fiscal from fiscal due to the elimination of the united express west coast and denver operations 
promotion and sales expense decreased by to million cents per asm during fiscal from million cents per asm in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in booking fees charged to mesa for processing reservations on computer reservation systems 
mesa s contract with america west eliminates booking fees and travel agency commissions being charged directly to mesa  and thus these expenses are expected to continue to decrease in fiscal depreciation and amortization decreased by million to million in fiscal and interest expense decreased by million to million in such period 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization was due to fewer aircraft being depreciated in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the decrease in interest expense was due to the retirement of aircraft  the proceeds of which were used to pay down debt secured by such aircraft 
during the fourth quarter of  pursuant to the ongoing review and evaluation of its operations  management elected to cease service on several routes flown by beech d aircraft 
management had historically employed numerous strategies in attempting to establish profitability on the routes but ultimately determined that undue effort and expense would be required in continuing to attempt to establish profitability 
in connection with the cessation of service  million of goodwill associated with the routes was determined to be unrecoverable and therefore charged to expense 
in connection with the cessation of service described above  mesa determined that beech d aircraft would no longer be required in scheduled service and were therefore impaired 
mesa planned to dispose of the aircraft during fiscal mesa recognized an impairment loss amounting to approximately million 
the amount of the impairment was determined by comparing the net book value of the aircraft against data provided by raytheon aircraft corporation rac  the manufacturer of the aircraft  on current resale values for aircraft of comparable age and condition 
during fiscal and  mesa recognized expected costs and expenses amounting to approximately million and million  respectively  for the termination of the united express operations which included the non renewal of the westair  and early termination of the mai  code sharing agreements with ual 
these costs and expenses are included in other operating items 
see footnotes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
both the million and the million provide for the estimated loss on retirement or sale of aircraft  parts  and equipment which were surplus to the needs of mesa upon expiration and early termination of the ual code sharing agreements 
in fiscal  mesa also recognized provisions amounting to million for the termination of the ft 
worth jet operations and million for the settlement of a shareholder lawsuit

during fiscal  the company invested approximately million in aircraft parts and other fixed assets  reduced long term debt by million and repurchased approximately million of its common stock 
the above factors  among others  resulted in a million decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal which comprises the majority of the decrease noted above 
as of september   the company had receivables of approximately million  compared to million at september  the amounts due consist primarily of receivables due from the company s code share partners and passenger ticket receivables due through the airline clearing house ach 
under the terms of the us airways code share agreements  the company receives a substantial portion of its revenues through the ach 
in january  the company entered into an agreement with embraer to acquire passenger embraer erj regional jets at an aggregate list price of approximately million 
deliveries began in april and are expected to continue through the summer months of calendar the company expects to finance the aircraft with long term operating lease arrangements 
the company also has options for an additional erj aircraft  with the right to convert the options into firm orders for erj regional jets or passenger erj regional jets 
in conjunction with this purchase agreement  the company placed an million deposit with embraer during fiscal the company has significant long term lease obligations primarily relating to its aircraft fleet 
the leases are classified as operating leases and are therefore excluded from the company s consolidated balance sheets 
at september   the company leased aircraft with remaining lease terms ranging from to years 
future minimum lease payments due under all long term operating leases were approximately  million at september  the company s long term debt was primarily incurred pursuant to the acquisition of d aircraft 
at september  the company owned d aircraft securing debt with maturities through in september  the company sold d aircraft to raytheon for approximately the amount of the underlying debt of million 
effective with the transaction  the company became current on the raytheon debt 
any event of default that may have occurred has been deemed to be fully cured pursuant to the terms of the agreement with raytheon 
in december  the company s board of directors authorized the company s purchase of up to of the outstanding shares of its common stock 
as of september   the company had acquired and retired approximately million shares approximately of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million

the contracts provide for payment at the time of the repair event for a fixed dollar amount per flight hour  subject to escalation based on changes in certain price indices  for the number of flight hours incurred since the previous event 
in december  the company reached an agreement with fleet capital for a million revolving line of credit  secured by the company s inventory and receivables 
the agreement  which expires in december  has provisions which allow the expansion of available credit to million by adding other lenders 
the company intends to use the facility for general working capital purposes 
management believes that the company will have adequate cash flow to meet its operating needs 
this is a forward looking statement 
actual cash flows could materially differ from this forward looking statement as a result of many factors  including the termination of one or more code share agreements  failure to sell  dispose of  or redeploy excess aircraft in a timely manner  a substantial decrease in the number of routes allocated to the company under its code share agreements with it code share partners  reduced levels of passenger revenue  additional taxes or costs of compliance with governmental regulations  fuel cost increases  increases in competition  increases in interest rates  general economic conditions and unfavorable settlement of existing litigation 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure such instruments at fair value 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
deferred the effective date of sfas no 
to all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company adopted the provisions of this statement on october  there was no impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 
provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to its debt obligations and short term marketable investment portfolio 
the company s debt obligations are primarily variable in rate and therefore have exposure to change in interest rates 
a change in interest rates would result in approximately million impact on interest expense 
the company also has investments in debt securities 
if short term interest rates were to average more than they did in fiscal year  there would be no material impact on the company s interest income 
the company s investments in equity securities are subject to market risk related to fluctuations in share prices for those shares held 
a change in the price of trading securities held at the level of investment at september  would impact the results of the company by approximately million 
the company has exposure to certain market risks associated with its aircraft fuel 
aviation fuel expense is a significant expense for any air carrier and even marginal changes greatly impact a carrier s profitability 
standard industry contracts do not generally provide protection against fuel price increases  nor do they insure availability of supply 
however  both the us airways and america west contract code share agreements allow fuel costs to be passed directly back to the code share partner  thereby reducing mesa s overall exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
in fiscal  of the company s fuel requirements were associated with these contracts 
each one cent change in the price of jet fuel amounts to a million change in annual fuel costs for that portion of fuel expense which cannot be passed on to either america west or us airways
