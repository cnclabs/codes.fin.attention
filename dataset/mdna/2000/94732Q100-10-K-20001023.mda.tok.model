all yearly references are to the company s fiscal years ended august   september   and september   unless otherwise indicated 
the fiscal years ended august  and september  contained fifty two weeks  compared to fifty three weeks for the fiscal year ended september  all tabular dollar amounts are stated in thousands 
certain reclassifications have been made in the following discussion and analysis to present results of operations on a consistent basis 
results of operations net income for was million  or per diluted share  on net sales of billion  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  on net sales of billion in and net income of million  or per share  on net sales of billion in in  we recognized special charges of million million net of taxes for e commerce infrastructure development and abandonment of capital projects 
excluding these charges  net income for was million  or per diluted share 
our consolidated gross margin percent increased to in from in and in the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain data derived from our consolidated income statements amount of sales amount of sales amount of sales net sales    gross margin    selling  general and    administrative expenses research and development    other expense income  net    operating income loss    income tax provision    net income    the following table summarizes our net sales for the periods indicated by business segment net sales amount of sales amount of sales amount of sales pc systems    hostpro  spectek    mcms  total net sales    pc systems net sales of systems were down in compared to primarily due to a decline in average selling prices and lower overall desktop and notebook unit shipments 
we initiated our vnd program in the third quarter of  which gained momentum in the fourth quarter with sales increasing over the third quarter 
desktop average selling prices were down in compared to  and notebooks and servers were down and respectively 
we continued to experience pressure on sales prices as a result of industry price competitiveness compounded by lower average selling prices in the retail direct channel through our vnd program 
system unit shipments for the fourth quarter of increased sequentially and compared to the fourth quarter of these increases were primarily due to the success of our vnd program in conjunction with sequential increases in sales to government agencies and year on year increases in small business sales 
net sales of computer systems were lower in compared to  primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices combined with a decrease in unit sales 
the decline in average selling prices for our desktop  notebook and server system sales were  and respectively 
lower prices were largely the result of industry price competitiveness and our strategic pricing designed to gain entry into key markets 
the decline in unit sales was primarily attributed to a drop in our desktop computer systems  which was partially offset by an increase in our higher margin server systems 
unit shipments were down in compared to desktop shipments as a percentage of total shipments remained relatively stable at of total unit sales in compared to in and in notebook shipments represented of overall net unit sales in compared to in and in server shipments remained flat in compared to at of total shipments 
hostpro this was the first year of operations of hostpro  our internet and web hosting business 
net revenue increased sequentially to million for the fourth quarter of hostpro accelerated its drive into higher end hosting with the number of dedicated and colocated servers increasing sequentially to more than at year end 
sequential organic growth of hosting accounts was in the fourth quarter  while hosting revenue grew by 
hostpro maintained over  paid hosted web sites   paid hosting accounts and  internet access accounts at year end 
monthly average churn for hosting accounts was approximately throughout the year 
spectek net sales of memory products were higher in compared to  primarily due to a increase in megabits sold  partially offset by a decline in average selling prices 
megabits shipped in increased as a result of the transition to the megabit component from the megabit component 
this transition reduced component test time and increased throughput from substantially all memory products 
although prices declined in compared to  spectek sold approximately more megabits in than in resulting in a increase in net sales 
the increase in megabits of memory products shipped in compared to was primarily due to reduced component test time and product transition to the megabit component from the megabit component 
the results of spectek s operations are influenced by a number of factors including pricing for  and availability of  nonstandard memory components 
see certain factors spectek operations 
mcms we sold of our interest in mcms  inc  mcms formerly micron custom manufacturing  inc  our custom manufacturing segment on february  accordingly  results of operations of mcms subsequent to february  are excluded from our results of operations 
gross margin amount of sales amount of sales amount of sales pc systems    hostpro  spectek    mcms  total gross margin    pc systems gross margin was down million in or as a percentage of net sales compared to the decline is largely due to lower sales and a shift in our sales mix from higher end consumer and commercial units to lower margin retail vnd systems 
gross margin on sales of systems was million or higher in compared to  principally due to lower component cost from improved asset management and a change in the sales mix towards higher margin systems  while being partially offset by a decline in average selling prices 
lower component cost in resulted from improved asset management compared to  as evidenced by analyzed inventory turns of times 
while overall average selling prices for the systems declined in compared to  unit sales of higher margin servers increased compared with we continue to experience significant pressure on our gross margins as a result of intense competition in the personal computer industry 
in addition  our gross margin percentage will continue to depend in large part on our ability to effectively manage inventories of system components 
our asset management ratios declined slightly at the end of days sales of inventory increased from days at the end of to days at the end of annualized pc inventory turns at the end of was times down from times at the end of hostpro the gross margin percentage of the hostpro segment remained flat at nearly in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter 
hostpro s gross margin percentage was lower in the last half of compared to the first half of the year primarily due to additional costs incurred to expand its information technology infrastructure and related support costs 
during the third quarter of  hostpro completed its expansion of  square feet of data center operations 
hostpro s cost of sales primarily represents telecommunications expenses  maintenance and depreciation of data center and related telecommunication and web hosting equipment  salary and benefits for data center and support personnel and the cost of hardware sold 
spectek despite increases in the cost of components under the cra with mti and decreases in average selling prices  spectek s gross margin percentages have remained relatively stable due to economies of scale and efficiencies achieved in the manufacturing process 
spectek s gross margin percentage decreased in compared to gross margin dollars generated on the sale of spectek memory products increased million or in compared to the gross margin on spectek sales was million or higher in compared to principally due to a increase in megabits shipped and a decline in average cost per components purchased from sources other than mti 
historically  spectek has experienced significant volatility in selling prices and expects average selling prices for its memory products to continue to exhibit significant volatility 
as a result  spectek s gross margin could decline and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the cra provides that the cost of components obtained from mti will be negotiated on a quarterly basis 
the cost of obtaining such components in was of pre tax income during the fourth quarter  during the third and second quarters and in the first quarter 
the cost of obtaining components under the cra will be of pretax income during the first quarter of we can not provide you assurance regarding the cost of components during any subsequent quarter 
additionally  we have no expectation that mti will agree to extend or renegotiate the cra at the end of its current term  which expires on august  see certain factors spectek operations we depend on the component recovery agreement with mti and certain factors spectek operations pricing of memory products may fluctuate 
selling  general and administrative consolidated selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million or in compared to the primary reason for the increase was the addition of the hostpro operations  which incurred million of sg a expenses in this was the first full year of operations of the hostpro business 
the pc systems segment sg a expenses increased by approximately million primarily due to higher advertising  marketing expenses and special charges of million for e commerce infrastructure development 
sg a expenses for declined million or compared to primarily due to lower advertising expense and technical fees 
in addition  during february  the company reduced its work force by approximately 
the company further reduced its sg a cost structure by the sale of its mcms operation in the second quarter of  and the closure of its japanese operations in the second quarter of internal software expense also decreased as a result of the company adopting the provisions of sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  in the first quarter of sg a expenses was also lower in compared to because of lower bad debt expense 
research and development consolidated research and development r d expenses declined in compared to we discontinued our advanced engineering group during the second quarter of  which focused on core logic chip sets  motherboards  and personal computer bios development  as well as product development of desktops  notebooks and servers 
consequently  we experienced lower r d expenses in the second half of and in the full year of the expenses incurred in consist primarily of labor expenses related to the development of patents and patent related expenses incurred by spectek 
other r d expenses relate to desktop  notebook and server development and engineering on the next generation platforms in our pc systems business 
research and development expenses declined in compared to the decrease is due to the discontinuance of the advanced engineering group during the year partially offset by a charge of million for the write off of purchased in process research and development related to the acquisition of hostpro 
hostpro s development efforts centered on customer support and service for systems  delivered through the internet 
the product is licensed to resellers and used internally by hostpro 
hostpro s in process technology development is aimed toward increasing the performance and redundancy of its web hosting systems 
because the development work conducted by hostpro was tailored to meet its specific infrastructure requirements and processes  alternative future uses of these development technologies do not exist 
technological feasibility of these in process projects had not been achieved as of the acquisition date  and significant technological risk remained 
the in process research and development write off related to the hostpro acquisition was million  and was based on estimated future revenues of million over the next six years 
all in process projects at the acquisition date were completed during the in process projects at the acquisition date consisted of the following 
customer service package 
the development efforts are focused on enabling remote management of accounts and automatic management and provisioning of web sites through a customer extranet 

automated utility system 
the development of this software package is for use in monitoring network connections  bandwidth usage and server status 
this proprietary technology is an automated utility programmed to monitor and respond to trends in server traffic 
in addition  this system will display vital statistics of the server for external monitoring and maintenance 

ip routing redundancy program 
this network infrastructure design effort is intended to increase network fault tolerance and will enable hostpro servers to share storage systems and dynamically allocate server requests 
for the identified in process projects  estimated cost to complete subsequent to the acquisition date is not significant 
based on a combination of man months  costs incurred and management s estimate of project completion  the projects were determined to be complete 
hostpro s planned research and development projects for which no significant efforts have been made were not included in the valuation 
the key assumptions in determining the incomplete in process technologies were 
discounted cash flows 
a discounted cash flows analysis of products incorporating in process technology was developed based on management s estimates of revenue and expenses associated with the products 

selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses was forecast based on historical ratios and industry standards 
projected sg a expenses decrease as a percentage of projected revenues due to expected sales growth with sg a expenses growth at a slower rate 
sg a expenses were assumed to remain of projected revenues instead of increasing due to the significant growth expected for internet companies during the next six years 

research and development 
additional research and development costs were projected based on management s estimate of future costs required to advance the design of the technology to the point that it met specific functional and economic requirements 

discount rate 
cash flow streams associated with in process technologies were discounted to present value at a rate of return an investor would require for a project with a risk profile similar to hostpro 
the discount rate for in process technology reflects the high risk profile attributable to this technology 
other expense consolidated other expense in consists of a million special charge for the abandonment of manufacturing equipment and an order entry system 
these expenses were recognized during the third quarter after our high capacity manufacturing facility was placed into service and a new order entry system was implemented 
the remaining expenses consist primarily of goodwill amortization associated with acquisitions in our hostpro business 
other expense for included million associated with the closure and consolidation of our japanese operation into our nampa operations 
the charge includes those costs associated with employee payroll and severance of million for approximately employees  fixed asset write downs of million  and million for lease obligations  pre committed advertising and other closure related costs 
all remaining liabilities were settled by september  with the cessation of our japanese operations  we benefited from an approximately million reduction of sg a expenses in compared to other expense in included million million in the second quarter of less a million revision of estimates in the fourth quarter of for costs associated with our actions to realign our pc operations to concentrate on its core markets and customers 
such actions include the consolidation of our domestic and international pc operations and the reduction of of our workforce  or approximately employees 
the realignment costs consisted of million associated with employee termination benefits  million for the write down of equipment and leasehold improvements  million in estimated costs for claims related to the realignment  million in aggregate costs associated with vacating a leased facility in milpitas  california  two international sales offices and an outlet store in minneapolis  minnesota and million for the write off of current technologies associated with our netframe enterprise servers 
as a result of the realignment  we benefited from an approximately million reduction of sg a expenses in compared to other expense in also included million for the write off of capitalized costs associated with abandoned internal use enterprise software development projects 
the software included an order entry system  an order configuration tool  and part of a material requirements planning package 
the software was abandoned after we concluded such software lacked the functionality we desired 
we also recognized a benefit resulting from a net rebate of million associated with a change of providers of on site service contracts for our domestic desktop installed base 
income taxes the provision for income taxes in is based on an effective tax rate of  which reflects the federal statutory rate  the net effect of state taxes and the effect of tax exempt foreign trade income and non deductible goodwill amortization 
the effective rate in of reflects the federal statutory rate  the net effect of state taxes  and the effect of a million charge for the write off of purchased in process research and development  which resulted from the acquisition of hostpro 
the decrease in the effective tax rate of in compared to is mainly due to an increase in the tax exempt foreign trade income 
the effective tax rate in of reflects the federal statutory rate  the net effect of state taxes  and establishment of a million valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset relating to the consolidation of our netframe enterprise server operations 
acquisitions we acquired and strategically invested in a number of companies to expand our internet access and web hosting capabilities through our hostpro business 
we expect to continue to expand our internet access and web hosting capabilities through internal growth  acquisitions and strategic investments 
see certain factors hostpro our future acquisitions may have adverse effects 
in  we acquired two web and application hosting companies and invested in one start up company 
in the last month of  we acquired one web hosting company and one internet access company 
on december  we acquired lightrealm  inc lightrealm  a kirkland  washington based web and applications hosting and internet access company serving small and medium size businesses 
we paid approximately million in cash  including expenses in exchange for of lightrealm s outstanding stock 
on march   we acquired worldwide international publishing corporation wipc  a boca raton  florida based web hosting company that also served small and medium size businesses 
we paid approximately million in cash  including expenses in exchange for of the outstanding stock of wipc 
we accounted for both transactions as purchases and allocated the purchase price to the net assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on the their fair values as determined by an independent appraiser 
our results of operations for include the results of operations of lightrealm and wipc  subsequent to their respective acquisition dates 
on april   we invested million in bird on a wire networks  inc  boaw  a toronto based dedicated web hosting start up company in exchange for a non interest bearing convertible debenture the debenture 
the debenture is convertible after april  or upon the occurrence of certain liquidity events  into common shares that will provide us with up to of the issued and outstanding common shares of boaw at the conversion date 
we accounted for this investment using the equity method of accounting 
on august   we acquired netlimited  inc dba hostpro  a los angeles based web and applications hosting provider serving small and medium size businesses 
shortly after the purchase  we adopted the hostpro name for our entire web hosting and internet access business 
we paid approximately million in cash  including expenses in exchange for of the outstanding stock of hostpro 
the purchase agreement contained a clause permitting an upward or downward adjustment to purchase price of up to depending on the number of subscriber accounts existing on february  the number of subscriber accounts met the requirements specified in the agreement  and accordingly we paid an additional million in march to the original seller  which was capitalized as part of the purchase price 
on september  we acquired the property and equipment of micron internet services mis  formerly a division of mti 
mis is a provider of dedicated  nationwide dial up and broadband internet access  virtual private network solutions  and e commerce services 
we paid approximately million in cash  an amount equal to the net book value of the assets of mis 
we accounted for this transaction at historical cost and our operations in were not affected by this transaction 
on march   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities  which consisted primarily of warranty obligations  of inacom government systems inacom  for approximately million in cash 
included in the assets were accounts receivable and a number of contracts with various federal agencies  including the department of veterans affairs procurement of hardware and software pchs contract 
the pchs contract is currently in its third year of a five year term and is open to orders from all government agencies 
on february   we sold of our interest in mcms in exchange for million in cash 
our results of operations for include a pre tax gain of million million or per diluted share  after taxes 
our financial statements include the results of mcms s operations through the date of sale 
net sales of mcms were approximately million in liquidity and capital resources as of august   we had cash  cash equivalents  and liquid investments of million  representing a decrease of million compared to september  principal sources of liquidity in were cash flows from operations of million  which were mostly derived from spectek  and proceeds from maturing investments of million 
see certain factors spectek operations we depend on the component recovery agreement with mti 
principal uses of cash in were purchases of held to maturity investments of million  property  plant and equipment expenditures of million and acquisitions and strategic investments  which amounted to million 
pursuant to the cra with mti effective september   and subject to certain conditions  mti will purchase and lease back to spectek equipment as is reasonably appropriate for spectek to perform its component recovery operations 
purchases by spectek accounted for million of our consolidated purchases of property  plant and equipment in we anticipate a substantial portion of the property  plant  and equipment expenditures by spectek will be reimbursed by mti under the cra 
as of august  approximately million of this amount had been reimbursed by mti at net book value 
we have an unsecured credit agreement  expiring june   with a group of financial institutions providing for borrowings totaling million 
as of august   we were eligible to borrow the full amount under the agreement  but had no borrowings outstanding 
under the agreement  we are subject to certain financial and other covenants including certain financial ratios and limitations on the amount of dividends we can declare or pay 
at august   we had commitments of million for purchases of equipment and million for infrastructure software projects 
we anticipate making capital expenditures in in excess of million 
we expect our future working capital requirements to increase and we believe that currently available cash and cash equivalents  liquid investments  cash flows from operations and current credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations through recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that all derivatives be recorded as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and marked to market on an ongoing basis 
sfas no 
applies to all derivatives including stand alone instruments  such as forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps  or embedded derivatives  such as call options contained in convertible debt investments 
along with the derivatives  the underlying hedged items are also to be marked to market on an ongoing basis 
these market value adjustments are to be included either in the statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income  depending on the nature of the transaction 
implementation of sfas no 
is required by our first quarter of we are currently evaluating the effect sfas may have on our future results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulleting sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sab summarizes certain staff views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
adoption is currently required in  and early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the effect this sab may have on our revenue recognition practices and results of operations

certain factors you should carefully consider the following factors and all other information contained in this form k before you make any investment decisions with respect to our securities 
the risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only risks we face 
if any of the adverse events described in the following factors actually occur or we do not accomplish necessary events or objectives described in the factors  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
general our operating results and stock price may fluctuate 
our past operating results have been  and our future operating results may be  subject to seasonality and other fluctuations  on a quarterly and an annual basis  as a result of a wide variety of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to 
industry competition  
our ability to accurately forecast demand and selling prices for our products  
fluctuating market pricing for personal computers  internet access and web hosting services and semiconductor memory products  
seasonal cycles common in the personal computer industry and seasonal government purchasing cycles  
inventory obsolescence  
our ability to effectively manage inventory levels  
changes in product mix  
manufacturing and production constraints  
fluctuating component costs  
the effects of product reviews and industry awards  
availability and pricing of the memory components used by spectek  
critical component availability  
the timing of our new product introductions and those of our competitors and 
global market and economic conditions as a result  our operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may occur in any future period 
the trading price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations due to general market conditions  our financial performance and that of our competitors  announcements of technological innovations  new commercial products or new strategies by our competitors  component availability and pricing  and other factors 
our management faces increased demands 
we have experienced increased complexity in our operations  in operating and financial information systems and in our scope of operations 
this increased complexity of our operations results from a number of factors  including the expansion of our internet access and web hosting services and the introduction of the vnd program 
this increased complexity has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for our management 
it has placed  and continues to place  significant demands upon our management  operating and financial information systems and other resources and systems 
in addition  during the past year  we underwent numerous changes in our management structure and personnel 
we continue to consider various expansion alternatives  including expansion of facilities  acquisition or establishment of facilities in new geographic regions and certain strategic relationships 
we can not assure you that our management resources  operating and financial information systems  other resources and systems will be adequate to support our existing or future operations 
if this should occur  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be subject to intellectual property claims 
it is common in our industry for patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights claims to be asserted against companies  including component suppliers and pc manufacturers 
periodically  we are made aware that technology used by us may infringe on intellectual property rights held by others 
we evaluate all such claims and  if necessary and appropriate  seek to obtain licenses for the continued use of such technology 
we have accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of claims for alleged infringement as of the respective dates of the balance sheets included in this report 
we would be at a competitive disadvantage if we were unable to obtain such licenses upon terms at least as favorable as those experienced by our competitors 
we have entered into several intellectual property license agreements  and as a majority owned subsidiary of mti  are licensed under certain license agreements between mti and third parties 
our rights under license agreements between mti and third parties may terminate in the event that we are no longer a majority owned subsidiary of mti 
intellectual property license agreements generally require one time or periodic royalty payments and are subject to expiration at various times 
if we or our suppliers are unable to obtain licenses necessary to use intellectual property in our products or processes  we may be forced to market products without certain technological features or software  discontinue sales of certain of our products and or defend legal actions taken against us relating to allegedly protected technology 
there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  and results of operations and cash flows if we can not obtain licenses to use certain technology or we are determined in a lawsuit to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
mti is our controlling shareholder 
as of august   mti owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  two of our five directors are also directors of mti  including steven r 
appleton  chairman and chief executive officer of mti 
so long as mti continues to own a majority of our outstanding common stock  mti will have the ability to control matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors  and potentially could control our management and corporate policies 
termination or modification of certain of our arrangements with mti resulting in terms less favorable to us could adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in the event that mti s ownership of us were to decrease below certain levels  certain arrangements may be terminated by mti  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see we may be subject to intellectual property claims and we depend on the component recovery agreement with mti 
the level of mti s ownership of our common stock may limit our ability to complete future equity financing 
in addition  the sale on the open market of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock currently held by mti could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock 
mti s ability to sell shares of our common stock  unless registered under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  is subject to volume and other restrictions pursuant to rule promulgated under the securities act 
we depend heavily on our key personnel 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain key management  technical and sales and marketing personnel 
we attempt to enhance our management and technical expertise by recruiting qualified individuals who possess desired skills and experience in certain targeted areas 
we experience strong competition for such personnel in the personal computer  internet access and web hosting  and semiconductor industries 
our inability to retain employees and attract and retain sufficient additional employees  and information technology  engineering and technical support resources  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we can not assure you that we will not lose key personnel or that the loss of any key personnel will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may face liabilities relating to year issues 
we did not experience any disruption to our business operations resulting from the transition to the year yk 
during the fiscal year ended august   we did not encounter significant issues related to our transactions with customers and suppliers 
as of the end of the fiscal year ended august  we had incurred million of yk related expenses  all of which were incurred in the first quarter 
we do not anticipate incurring additional material costs related to yk readiness programs 
on october   we were sued in state court in canyon county  idaho  by hannah films  inc  on behalf of itself and on behalf of an unidentified and uncertified class of plaintiffs alleging fraud  breach of implied warranty of merchantability  violation of the magnuson moss consumer protection act  and violation of the idaho consumer protection act arising out of the year status of a personal computer sold by us to hannah films  inc  in october in may  the case was dismissed with prejudice 
the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal 
however  the parties subsequently agreed to dismiss the appeal with each side to bear its own costs and fees 
we are subject to a variety of government regulations 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  federal communications commission regulations  governmental procurement regulations  import and export regulations  federal trade commission regulations  securities regulations  environmental regulations  antitrust regulations  and labor regulations 
any failure by us to comply with such regulations in the past  present or future could subject us to liabilities and or the suspension of our operations 
if this occurs  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may have additional liabilities for sales and use taxes 
during the third quarter of  we began to collect and remit applicable sales or use taxes in nearly all states 
we are party to agreements with nearly all states  which generally limit our liability  if any  for non remittance of sales and use taxes prior to such agreements effective dates 
we have previously accrued a liability for the estimated settlement cost of issues related to sales and use taxes not covered by such agreements 
our management believes the resolution of any matters relating to the non remittance of sales or use taxes will not materially affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
pc systems we face intense competition 
the personal computer industry is highly competitive and has been characterized by intense pricing pressure  generally low gross margin percentages  rapid technological advances in hardware and software  frequent introduction of new products  and rapidly declining component costs 
competition in the pc industry is based primarily upon brand name recognition  performance  price  reliability and service and support 
as a result of pc industry standards  we and our competitors use many of the same components  typically from the same set of suppliers  which limits our ability to technologically and functionally differentiate our products 
many of our pc competitors have greater brand name recognition and market share  offer broader product lines  and have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
we face significant challenges of scale compared to our larger competitors 
our competitors may benefit from component volume purchasing  economies of scale  and product and process technology license arrangements that are more favorable in terms of pricing and availability than our arrangements 
in addition  we may be at a relative cost disadvantage to certain of our competitors as a result of our us dollar denominated purchases of pc components during periods of relative weakening of the us dollar 
our failure to compete effectively in the marketplace could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we compete with a number of personal computer manufacturers  which sell their products primarily through direct channels  including dell computer corporation and gateway  inc we also compete with personal computer manufacturers such as compaq computer corporation  hewlett packard company  international business machines corporation  nec corporation and toshiba corporation among others 
several of these manufacturers  which have traditionally sold their products through national and regional distributors  dealers and value added resellers  and retail stores  now sell their products through the direct channel 
these manufacturers also compete with our retail sales under the vnd program 
in addition  we expect to face increased competition from foreign pc suppliers and from foreign and domestic suppliers of personal computer products that decide to implement  or devote additional resources to  a direct sales or retail direct sales strategy 
in order to gain an increased share of the united states personal computer direct sales market  these competitors may effect a pricing strategy that is more aggressive than the current pricing in the direct sales market or may have pricing strategies influenced by relative fluctuations in the us dollar compared to other currencies 
we believe that the rate of growth in worldwide sales of personal computers  particularly in the united states  where we sell a substantial majority of our systems  has declined and may remain below the growth rates experienced in recent years 
industry forecast project generally decreasing growth rates in personal computer sales 
any general decline in demand or decline in the rate of increase in demand for systems could increase price competition and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not effectively manage our inventory 
our ability to compete successfully in the personal computer market in the future will depend in large part on our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products and effectively manage our inventories to support this demand 
our pc systems operations focus on the direct sale of assemble to order systems that feature components incorporating the latest technological developments in the personal computer industry 
we have experienced in the past  and could experience in the future  excess inventories and inventory obsolescence 
this could result from  among other things  our inaccuracy in forecasting demand for our products  the typically longer lead times associated with notebook product supply  the fast pace of technological developments in the personal computer industry and the short product life cycles of personal computer systems and components 
in addition  because high volumes of quality components are required for the manufacture of our systems  we have experienced in the past  and expect to experience in the future  shortages and other supply constraints of key components 
such shortages or supply constraints have in the past adversely affected  and could in the future adversely affect  our ability to ship products on schedule or at expected gross margins 
we invest in data systems tools to further enhance sales forecasting and supply demand planning processes 
we have made a large investment in our new manufacturing facilities to further reduce the risks of having excess inventory or inability to produce customer orders 
to continue to improve  we must accurately utilize these new processes  facilities and tools to forecast demand for our personal computer products and obtain adequate  but not excessive  supplies of components to meet actual demand 
our failure to manage our inventories effectively could result in excess inventories  inventory obsolescence  component shortages and untimely shipment of products 
any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we depend on key sources of supply 
we focus on providing systems that feature components and software incorporating the latest technological developments 
these components are periodically in short supply and are available from sole or a limited number of suppliers 
as a result  we have experienced in the past  and expect to experience in the future  shortages in the components used in our systems 
intel has been our predominant provider of microprocessors used in our systems 
from time to time  we have been unable to obtain sufficient quantities of certain intel microprocessors 
in addition  a significant portion of the ram components used in our systems is supplied by mti  and we generally rely on mti to supply the latest memory densities and configurations available 
we rely  to a certain extent  upon our suppliers abilities to enhance existing products in a timely and cost effective manner  to develop new products to meet changing customer needs and to respond to emerging standards and other technological developments in the personal computer industry 
our reliance on a limited number of suppliers and on a strategy of incorporating the latest technological developments into our systems involves several risks  including the possibility of shortages and or increases in costs of components and software  and risk of reduced control over delivery schedules  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our notebook products are currently assembled in part by third party manufacturers 
these outsourcing arrangements and any future outsourcing arrangements that we may enter into may reduce the direct control we have over certain components and the assembly of such products 
we can not assure you that the outsourcing arrangements will not result in quality problems or affect our ability to ship such products on a timely basis or our flexibility to respond to changing market conditions 
our exposure to seasonality could increase 
in the event our vnd sales expand relative to our other system sales  we could experience an increase in the seasonality of our business and financial results could become dependent on our retail business fluctuations 
hostpro our hostpro segment faces intense competition 
the market for internet access and web hosting is extremely competitive 
primary competitive factors in this industry include having a recognized and trusted brand name  maintaining a secure reliable national network with sufficient capacity to support continued growth  maintaining internet system engineering and technical expertise  introducing new products and services in a timely manner  maintaining sufficient financial resources  providing excellent customer care through prompt and capable technical support and offering competitive prices 
as the growth of internet usage increases  competition is expected to intensify 
some of our current and prospective competitors include national  regional and local internet service providers  cable television companies  direct broadcast satellite and wireless communications providers  on line service providers  web hosting providers  global  national  and regional long distance companies and local exchange telecommunications companies 
many of our competitors have greater market presence  brand recognition  network capacity  customer bases and financial resources than we do 
a large number of companies including interland  inc  verio  and concentric network corporation  a nextlink company  offer e services similar to those provided by us 
large diversified companies such as intel corporation  dell computer corporation  international business machines corporation  and at t corporation have entered or indicated their intent to enter into the e services market  which will intensify the competition 
we compete with major long distance companies who offer internet access services  and the recent federal regulation of the telecommunications industry has created more opportunities for local carriers thereby further increasing competition 
in addition  major cable companies and other alternative service providers such as those companies utilizing wireless terrestrial and satellite based service technologies have announced plans to offer internet access and related services 
in addition to possessing large existing customer bases  many of these companies have greater network coverage  market presence and financial resources than we do 
these companies also possess the ability to bundle internet access with basic local and long distance telecommunications services 
this bundling may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete effectively and may result in pricing pressures that would adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our expansion  acquisitions and investment strategy involves certain risks 
in  we acquired of the outstanding common stock of netlimited  inc dba hostpro for approximately million in cash and the property and equipment of mis  a division of mti  for its book value of approximately million in cash 
in  we acquired of the outstanding common stock of lightrealm for approximately million in cash  of the outstanding common stock of wipc for approximately million in cash and also invested million in boaw in exchange for a non interest bearing convertible debenture 
we can not assure you that the integration  reconfiguration or other modification  if any  of hostpro  mis  lightrealm or wipc will not have a material adverse effect on the operations of such entities or on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  there can be no assurance we will realize the anticipated benefits associated with these acquisitions  including  but not limited to  retention of key personnel  intellectual property rights  increased market presence of a broader e services offering and economies of consolidating certain administrative support functions 
our future acquisitions may have adverse effects 
we expect to continue our expansion and acquisition strategy 
material goodwill and other intangible assets could be required to be recorded in the likely event the purchase price of the acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired 
this could result in significant amortization charges in future periods 
the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenues and earnings anticipated by us 
as a result there could be a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations 
we can not assure you of the timing or size of future acquisitions  or the effect that any future acquisitions may have on our operating results 
further we cannot assure you that suitable acquisition targets will be available under terms acceptable to us 
we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions 
in the integration of acquired operations  we face certain key risks 
the difficulties experienced may have an adverse impact on us 
the key integration difficulties may include the loss of key employees and the failure to integrate successfully acquired operations  equipment  facilities  services and networks 
these difficulties could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we can not assure you that we will realize any benefits from the acquired operations 
we depend on our suppliers and sources of supply 
we rely on other companies to supply certain key components of our network infrastructure  the quantity and quality of which is only available from limited sources 
we also rely on providers of data communication facilities and network capacity in addition to local carriers all of whom are oftentimes our competitors 
we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary services on a cost effective basis and within the time frame we require on an ongoing basis  which may have an adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we depend on our ability to expand hostpro s infrastructure capacity 
the success of hostpro is dependent upon our ability to expand its infrastructure capacity  equipment and support services at a competitive cost 
we may require substantial financial  operational and managerial resources to expand our network infrastructure to accommodate new customer growth 
we may also need to enter into additional agreements with providers of infrastructure capacity and equipment and support services 
we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain agreements with acceptable terms or that we will be able to make the necessary network infrastructure modifications to meet our customer s growing demands and changes evolving within the industry 
we are subject to changes in technology and industry standards 
the internet access and web hosting industry is subject to rapid changes in technology  changes in customer needs  and the evolution of industry standards 
the ability to effectively advance technical expertise  develop new products compatible with emerging technology  and adapt to customers changing needs all in a cost effective manner is essential for our future success 
we can not assure you that we will be successful in accomplishing these tasks 
in addition  we can not assure you those services or technologies developed by others will not render our services or technology noncompetitive or obsolete 
we are vulnerable to network failure 
our network  and other networks that provide services to us  are vulnerable to damage or cessation of operations from earthquakes  severe storms  power loss  fire  telecommunications failures and other similar events 
our networks are designed to minimize the risk of such system failures 
however  we can not assure you that we will not experience network failures or even a complete network shutdown 
network security breaches could affect hostpro 
security problems represent an ongoing threat to public and private data networks 
addressing these problems caused by computer viruses  break ins or other problems caused by third parties could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations 
security measures such as limiting physical and network access to routers are in place 
however  we can not assure you that we can offer our customers complete protection from computer viruses  break ins and other related problems 
although we attempt to limit contractually our liability in such cases  the occurrence of these problems may result in claims against us 
these claims  regardless of their outcome  could result in costly litigation and adversely affect our business and reputation 
in addition  the ability to obtain and retain customers may be compromised by an inability to provide secure transmission of information over the internet 
these issues could have an adverse impact on our customer growth rate  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
spectek operations we depend on the component recovery agreement with mti 
effective september   we entered into an amended and restated component recovery agreement the cra with mti  which expires august  we have no expectation that mti will agree to extend or renegotiate the cra at the end of the current term 
in addition  mti currently has an option to require us to sell to it spectek s property and equipment for a purchase price equal to net book value  and mti can exercise this purchase option at any time 
the cra would terminate if mti purchases the property and equipment of spectek 
under the cra  mti is required to provide us with all of the nonstandard memory components produced at its semiconductor operations 
the cra also provides that the cost of components obtained from mti will be negotiated on a quarterly basis 
the cost of obtaining components in was of pre tax income attributable to the sale of such components in the fourth quarter  in the third and second quarters and in the first quarter 
the cost of obtaining components under the cra will be of pretax income during the first quarter of we can not assure you of the cost of obtaining components under the cra during any subsequent quarter 
any increase in cost to us to obtain components from mti under the cra could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the cra also provides that mti will make commercially reasonable efforts to obtain for us nonstandard memory components produced by tech semiconductor singapore pte 
ltd 
and kmt semiconductor limited  joint venture companies in which mti is affiliated 
we may agree with mti and the joint venture companies to utilize a pricing matrix based on effective yields and worldwide average sales prices in order to establish prices for the components from the joint venture companies 
in such case  the price paid by us for components from the joint ventures will be determined under the matrix  rather than as a percentage of pre tax net income 
the expiration or termination of the cra  or the sale of the property and equipment of spectek to mti  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
historically  spectek has had a significant positive impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
in  the spectek segment s net sales were million and its operating income was million 
virtually all of the components used by spectek are obtained from mti or affiliates of mti under the cra 
based on net sales  spectek obtained   and of its components from mti in  and  respectively 
based on net sales  spectek obtained an additional and of its components from mti s joint venture affiliates in and  respectively 
semiconductor manufacturers other than mti are reluctant to sell us nonstandard memory components because such components could compete with their full specification memory components for similar applications 
in addition  some manufacturers are concerned that subsequent testing performed by a recovery operation could reveal proprietary data regarding manufacturing yields and processes 
because of the significant impediments to obtaining alternative sources of supply  it is unlikely that the company will be able to continue its spectek operations following expiration or termination of the cra 
pricing of memory products may fluctuate 
pricing for semiconductor memory products fluctuates  to a large degree  based on industry wide pricing for semiconductor memory products 
historically  we have experienced significant volatility in the average selling prices of our spectek memory products 
management believes that volatility in the average selling prices of semiconductor memory products was due primarily to changes in the balance of supply and demand for these commodity products and changes in relative weakness or strength of certain currencies 
we are unable to predict the impact of semiconductor memory product market dynamics in future periods 
further declines in pricing for semiconductor memory products would likely result in declines in average selling prices of our spectek memory products 
if this occurs  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
memory product transition 
the semiconductor memory industry is characterized by  among other things  rapid technological change  frequent product introductions and enhancements  difficulties experienced in transitioning to new products  relatively short product life cycles and volatile market conditions 
during periods of product transition  spectek has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  significant increases in component test times and corresponding decreases in throughput 
future gross margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively transition to new products in a timely fashion 
we may be adversely affected by failure to perform under an exclusive sales representative agreement 
effective september   we entered into an exclusive sales agreement the sales agreement with micron semiconductor products  inc msp  a subsidiary of mti  under which msp will serve as exclusive sales representatives for spectek memory products 
the failure of msp to perform its obligations under the sales agreement  including but not limited to the sale of all spectek memory products  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our liquid investments and a majority of our debt are at fixed interest rates  and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of august   approximately of our liquid investments mature within three months and mature within one year 
as of august   management believes the reported amounts of liquid investments and debt to be reasonable approximations of their fair values and has the ability and intent to hold these instruments to maturity 
as a result  management believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of financial instruments is minimal 
we use the us dollar as our functional currency 
aggregate transaction gains and losses included in the determination of net income have not been material
