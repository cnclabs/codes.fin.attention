in  the company derived a substantial portion of its total revenues from admissions and event related revenue attributable to major nascar sanctioned racing events  four irl racing events  three nascar craftsman truck series racing events  and one nhra nationals racing event

in and  the company s second and fourth quarters accounted for and  respectively  of its total annual revenues and and  respectively  of its total annual operating income 
the company sometimes produces minimal operating income or losses during its third quarter when it hosts only one major nascar race weekend 
in  the company s operating results for the first and third quarters were significantly impacted by the additional racing events held at lvms 
the concentration of racing events in the second quarter  and the growth in the company s operations with attendant increases in overhead expenses  will tend to increase operating losses or minimize operating income in future first and third quarters 
also  racing schedules may be changed from time to time and can lessen the comparability of operating results between quarterly results of successive years and increase or decrease the seasonal nature of the company s business 
the irl and nascar sanctioned craftsman truck series racing events hosted at tms in the fourth quarter of were held in the third quarter of in addition  the irl racing event hosted at lmsc in the second quarter of was held in the third quarter of the busch grand national series race at ams  originally scheduled to be held in march  was rescheduled to november due to poor weather conditions

may irl race event at lmsc cancelled after accident on may   during the running of an irl event at lmsc  an on track accident occurred that caused race car debris to enter the spectator seating area 
three deaths resulted  and all three decedents estates filed separate wrongful death lawsuits against smi  irl and others in the superior court of mecklenburg county  north carolina

smi has filed answers in all three pending actions  and preliminary discovery has occurred 
smi intends to defend itself and denies the allegations of negligence as well as related claims for punitive damages 
management does not believe the outcome of these lawsuits will have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position or future results of operations 
other significant factors arising in fiscal the operating results for fiscal  and more specifically the three months ended september   were negatively impacted by less than expected attendance and event related revenues for irl racing events at ams and lvms  less than expected attendance and increased direct event expenses due to poor weather conditions at bms s inaugural nhra event  continued carrying costs of lvms s industrial park  and expenses for media and other promotional campaigns of oil chem

in fiscal  rental operations associated with property held for sale resulted in operating losses and pro forma net losses  after taxes  of approximately  and million  respectively 
management intends to use the sale proceeds principally to reduce outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
management anticipates that cash from operations  and funds available through the credit facility  will be sufficient to meet the company s operating needs through  including planned capital expenditures at its speedway facilities 
based upon anticipated future growth and financing requirements  management expects that the company will  from time to time  engage in additional financing of a character and in amounts to be determined 
while the company expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from its existing speedway operations  and has generally experienced improvement in its financial condition  liquidity and credit availability  such resources  as well as possibly others  could be needed to fund the company s continued growth  including the continued expansion and improvement of its speedway facilities 
capital expenditures significant growth in the company s revenues depends  in large part  on consistent investment in facilities 
therefore  the company expects to continue to make substantial capital improvements in its facilities to meet increasing demand and to increase revenue 
currently  a number of significant capital projects are underway 
in  ams and spr continued to improve and expand on site roads and available parking  reconfiguring traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow  and made various site improvements 
bms completed reconstructing and expanding its dragstrip into a state of the art dragway with permanent grandstand seating  luxury suites  and extensive fan amenities and facilities  and made other site improvements 
in  lmsc added approximately  permanent seats  expanded parking areas to accommodate the increases in attendance and ease congestion  and made other site improvements

also  lmsc and tms are constructing mile  modern  lighted  dirt track facilities 
lvms plans to add approximately  permanent seats  further expand concessions  restroom and other fan amenities  and make other site improvements

tms plans to continue improving and expanding its on site roads and available parking and making other site improvements 
in  after adding approximately  permanent seats  exclusive of spr  the company s total permanent seating capacity will exceed  and the total number of luxury suites will be approximately the estimated aggregate cost of capital expenditures in will approximate million 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at the company s facilities  including undetected soil or land conditions  additional land acquisition costs  increases in the cost of construction materials and labor  unforeseen changes in the design  litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site and national or regional economic changes 
in addition  the actual cost could vary materially from the company s estimates if the company s assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
construction is also subject to state and local permitting processes  which if changed  could materially affect the ultimate cost 
in addition to expansion and improvements of its existing speedway facilities and business operations  the company is continually evaluating new opportunities that will add value for the company s stockholders  including the acquisition and construction of new speedway facilities  the expansion and development of its existing legends cars and oil chem products and markets and the expansion into complementary businesses 
dividends the company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
any decision concerning the payment of dividends on the common stock will depend upon the results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans of the company  as well as such factors as permissibility under the credit facility  the senior subordinated notes and as the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
the credit facility and senior subordinated notes preclude the payment of any dividends

however  the change is not expected to materially impact the company s financial position or future results of operations 
environmental matters the company s property at lmsc includes areas that were used as solid waste landfills for many years 
landfilling of general categories of municipal solid waste on the lmsc property ceased in there is one landfill currently operating at lmsc  however  that is permitted to receive inert debris and waste from land clearing activities lcid landfills  and one lcid landfill that was closed in two other lcid landfills on the lmsc property were closed in lmsc intends to allow similar lcid landfills to be operated on the lmsc property in the future 
prior to  lmsc leased certain lmsc property to allied waste industries  inc for use as c d landfill  which can receive solid waste resulting solely from construction  remodeling  repair or demolition operations on pavement  buildings or other structures  but cannot receive inert debris  land clearing debris or yard debris 
in addition  allied waste industries owns and operates an active solid waste landfill adjacent to lmsc 
management believes that the active solid waste landfill was constructed in such a manner as to minimize the risk of contamination to surrounding property 
management also believes that the company s operations  including the landfills and facilities on its property  are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
management is not aware of any situations related to landfill operations which it expects would materially adversely affect the company s financial position or future results of operations
