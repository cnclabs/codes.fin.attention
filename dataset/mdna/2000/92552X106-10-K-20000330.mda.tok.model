vialog has established and will continue to pursue partnerships with internet businesses to increase market penetration via the internet for vialog s services 
industry overview services the conferencing industry  which includes audio  video and internet conferencing  provides a range of services to facilitate multiparty communications with participants in different locations 
through conferencing services  customers conduct routine meetings  run training sessions  and share information when face to face meetings would be too costly  impractical or inconvenient 
industry studies published by frost sullivan estimate that the conferencing services sector will grow at a compound annual rate of approximately between and audioconferencing audioconferencing connects multiple parties on a single telephone call through specialized telephone equipment known as a bridge 
each bridge has multiple ports which allow conference participants to connect to a conference call 
calls may be established manually by an operator who places calls to or receives calls from conference participants 
the company believes that technological advances  combined with the greater overall awareness and acceptance of audioconferencing as a business tool  have contributed to the increased usage of conferencing over the last six years 
the company believes that the demand for audioconferencing services has also increased as a result of a wide range of trends  including globalization of operations  increased workforce training requirements  the advent of geographically dispersed work teams  shared decision making  and the growing role of strategic partnerships 
users of audioconferencing are able to replace travel to existing meetings  with attendant savings of actual and opportunity cost  and increase communication with parties with whom they would otherwise not meet  thereby yielding greater organizational productivity 
the company believes that the facilities  network and labor costs associated with audioconferencing services  combined with a lack of expertise and a desire to focus on their core businesses  have caused most organizations to outsource audioconferencing 
videoconferencing videoconferencing is similar to audioconferencing except that one or more callers may be viewed on a video monitor by the other participants 
the company believes that the broad adoption of videoconferencing as a meeting tool has historically been constrained by several factors  including limited access to video sites  expensive and proprietary equipment  limited and costly network facilities  incompatibility of systems and poor video quality 
the adoption of industry standards  technological advances which have brought down the cost of equipment and required bandwidth and increased processing speed which has improved quality have all contributed to the development of desktop videoconferencing applications 
interactive multipoint videoconferencing also became feasible in with the introduction of more cost effective video technology and low cost  pc based video cameras and sound cards 
the rapid deployment of compatible hardware  reductions in cost  increases in available bandwidth  and improvements in quality are all expected to accelerate the growth of the market for multipoint videoconferencing 
internet conferencing internet conferencing services include web presentation sharing and audio streaming services 
web presentation sharing  which enables multiple users to conference and collaborate using both text and voice  is the most recent advancement in conferencing 
audio streaming enables participants to listen to an audioconference being streamed live over the internet 
listen only participants can access the audioconference by logging on to a web site and listening via a multimedia pc 
the company s conferencing services audioconferencing vialog offers a broad range of audioconferencing and related services  primarily to businesses in the financial  retail  professional services and pharmaceutical industries  as well as to government agencies and trade associations 
the company generates revenues from its infrastructure of approximately  ports of capacity by charging on a per line  per minute basis 
the company s audioconferencing services are divided into two major service categories operator attended and operator on demand 
each category offers standard services such as dialing out to late participants and conducting a roll call at no additional cost  as well as enhanced services at additional cost 
for those conference calls requiring a reservation  the company s new internet portal site  webconferencing 
com  may be used for greater convenience 
there are three different types of operator attended service meet me  dial out and a combination of the two 
meet me audioconferences allow participants to join a conference either by dialing a toll free number provided by the company or by using their own local or long distance service providers 
for dial out audioconferences  the company s operators contact participants and join them together in a conference 
a combination of the two service types is also available 
participants may join an operator on demand conference either by dialing a toll free number provided by the company or by using their own local or long distance service providers  then entering a passcode on their touch tone keypad 
for additional security and to verify attendance  participants may be required to enter a personal identification number pin after they enter the conference passcode 
while operators are not necessary for an operator on demand audioconference  they can be reached for assistance by pressing in november  vialog launched a service that eliminates a reservation and or an operator to place a conference call between or less parties

similar to audioconferencing  this service is charged on a per line  per minute basis  with enhanced services charged on a fee basis 
videoconferencing requires the use of a video bridge and telecommunications facilities of greater bandwidth than that required for a standard audioconference and is consequently billed at much higher rates 
the company provides its video services from its reston center 
videoconferences can be assembled in two ways meet me and dial out 
meet me videoconferences are those in which participating sites dial in to the company s video bridge at a scheduled date and time  using an assigned telephone number 
each site may be greeted by an operator or be connected directly  without the operator s presence 
dial out videoconferences are those in which a company operator dials out to participating sites prior to a videoconference and connects them to the conference 
as part of its solutions approach  the company tests the standards of all participating sites to assure compatability and quality standards 
the company offers pc based application sharing via the company s videoconferencing bridges

decreasing cost structure 
through the recent consolidation of its nine operating centers into four operating centers  vialog expects to improve its operating margins by reducing labor and overhead expenditures 
also  as vialog grows through increased penetration  it also improves its cost structure based on economies of scale 
long distance expenses represent vialog s second largest cost  and vialog s recently announced contract with qwest communications reduces its per minute long distance cost by approximately 
additionally  advances in bridge technology have reduced vialog s capital requirements to accommodate growth in audioconferencing from approximately per port in to a current cost per port of approximately unique industry position scale with focus 
the company believes that it is the largest company in the industry focusing solely on conferencing services 
the company s largest competitors are long distance service providers for which conferencing represents only a small fraction of their total revenues

since november  vialog has centralized several of its operations  including sales  marketing  human resources  benefits administration  finance and cash management functions 
additionally  the company recently consolidated four of its operating centers  which the company believes will provide operational efficiencies and reduce operating costs

throughout  the company has made progress in its efforts to centralize support activities  including reservations  billing  purchasing and management information systems in order to standardize its services  improve customer service and reduce operating expenses

in addition  the company has undertaken several marketing and sales initiatives  including deployment of a national sales force to access new geographic areas and national accounts  establishment of a coordinated telemarketing effort and implementation of database marketing programs 
pursue outsourced services opportunities 
the company has deployed a wholesale sales organization which intends to capitalize on what the company believes to be significant opportunities to provide outsourced services to inter exchange carriers ixcs  local exchange carriers lecs and rbocs as these providers continue to reduce their dependence upon labor intensive activities 
vialog currently has contracts to provide outsourced services to a number of facilities based and non facilities based telecommunications service providers 
as rbocs obtain regulatory approval to provide long distance service  the company believes that some will desire to enter the market quickly with complete packages of high quality telecommunications services  including conferencing 
as a result  some rbocs and lecs may seek to outsource their conferencing requirements in order to speed up their time to market 
the company believes that it is well positioned to compete for outsourced conferencing business from the ixcs  lecs and rbocs because it does not compete with ixcs  lecs or rbocs in their core businesses  it has the capacity and resources to handle significant conferencing volume and it has experience in providing services on an outsourced basis 
leverage the internet

sales and marketing vialog believes it is the first independent conferencing company to employ a comprehensive marketing program to establish a national brand for conferencing services 
the company s retail national sales organization offers a full range of conferencing services to its customers 
the company s wholesale account executives offer these same services to facilities based carriers and non facilities based telecommunications service providers who desire to offer outsourced conferencing services to their customers under their own brands 
establishing a national brand 
the company s marketing and sales strategy centers on establishing vialog as the brand identified with high value and expert delivery of conferencing services 
the company is implementing a corporate marketing program focused on customers who have the potential for high use 
this marketing program will employ targeted database marketing techniques based on the combined customer data of the operating centers  emerging trends and other market segment information 
retail sales 
the company employs a national retail sales strategy utilizing both an outside and inside sales group

an outside sales group of approximately professionals operates from four regional offices  and is primarily responsible for origination of new business 
an inside sales group of approximately professionals responds to inbound requests  assists customers in implementing vialog s service offerings and supports the outside sales force 
wholesale sales 
the company has deployed a wholesale sales organization which intends to capitalize on what the company believes to be significant opportunities for revenue growth by providing outsourced services to ixcs  lecs  and rbocs 
while conferencing services make up a small portion of these companies overall business  they are an important part of a full service service provider s portfolio 
the company offers these companies the ability to efficiently outsource all conferencing services and support 
the company believes its wholesale sales initiative is justified by an increasing trend among telecommunications companies to outsource non core  labor intensive services 
the company believes that this trend has been evidenced by existing outsourcing of services  such as billing and telemarketing and downsizing of personnel as these companies move away from labor intensive activities 
in addition  potential opportunities exist as a result of the telecommunications act of to provide services in new markets 
the company currently has contracts to provide outsourced services to a number of facilities based and non facilities based telecommunications service providers 
an important element of the company s marketing strategy will be to secure additional outsourcing contracts and to expand net revenues from its existing customer base 
in order to capitalize on this market  the company has hired a vice president of wholesale sales and two senior telecom sales professionals who have extensive experience in the industry 
e commerce 
the company has embraced the internet  and is using e commerce to extend vialog s sales distribution 
both through webconferencing 
com and private label offerings through internet strategic partners  vialog s services can be cost effectively sold to customers too small to be targeted via direct sales 
customer service the company believes that it has successfully obtained and retained customers due to quality customer service provided by a highly skilled staff 
reservationists and operators become the company s primary contacts with its customers after the initial sales effort  thereby providing opportunities to support the sales effort with personalized service 
in some cases  customers have become accustomed to working with a particular reservationist or operator and insist upon continued assistance from these specific individuals 
reservationists assist the company s customers in scheduling their conferences 
reservationists access the conferencing system to determine time and ports available and to confirm the conferences 
operators monitor calls and provide the services requested in the reservation 
operators are also trained to provide assistance to the moderator usually the person initiating the conference to ensure a successful conference 
supervisors are available to assist in the setup and execution of a conference 
the company s staff is trained to facilitate effective conferences through a combination of classroom  mentoring  teaming  and on the job supervision 
customers the company provided services to over  customers in the customers ranged in size from major multinational corporations and fortune companies to small businesses  professional organizations  public institutions and individuals 
a breakdown of the company s top customers based on consolidated net revenues  including both wholesale and retail customers  by industry is as follows financial services six  telecommunications five  retail four  high technology three  professional services two  and pharmaceutical one 
no account represented more than of the company s consolidated net revenues in the top customers of the company represented approximately of the company s pro forma net revenues in and of the company s pro forma net revenues in competition the conferencing service industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change 
in the audioconferencing market  the company currently competes  or expects to compete in the near future  with the following categories of companies i ixcs  such as at t  mci worldcom  sprint  global crossing and cable wireless  ii independent lecs  such as gte  and iii other private conference service bureaus pcsbs 
the ixcs generally do not market conferencing services separately  but rather offer such services as part of a bundled telecommunications offering 
the ixcs have not emphasized enhanced services or customized communications solutions to meet customer needs 
however  there can be no assurance that these competitors will not alter their current strategies and begin to focus on services specific selling  customized solutions and operator attended services  the occurrence of any of which could increase competition 
under the telecommunications act of  the rbocs may also be allowed to provide long distance services within the regions in which they also provide local exchange services in region long distance services upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  including the specific approval of the federal communications commission  the introduction of or a defined potential for facilities based local competition  the offering of local services for resale  and compliance with access and interconnection requirements for facilities based competitors 
upon entrance into the long distance market  the ability of an rboc to gain immediate and significant conferencing market share could be enhanced by its status as the incumbent primary provider of local services to its customers 
in the videoconferencing and internet conferencing markets  the company competes with existing providers of audio teleconferencing services  as well as new competitors dedicated to video and or internet conferencing 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors influencing the market for its services are brand identity  quality of customer service  breadth of service offerings  price and vendor reputation 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully with respect to any of these factors 
competition may result in significant price reductions  decreased gross margins  loss of market share and reduced acceptance of the company s services 
the company derived approximately of its pro forma net revenues from ixcs and lecs which outsource conferencing services provided to their respective customers 
these telecommunications companies have the financial capability and expertise to deliver such services internally 
there can be no assurance that the company s current ixc and lec customers will not begin to provide the conferencing services now being provided by the company and pursue such market actively and in direct competition with the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
moreover  the company believes that part of its growth will occur from rbocs which may enter the long distance market and outsource their conferencing services 
there can be no assurance that any telecommunications company will be able to offer conferencing services legally  now or in the future  will choose to do so or that those choosing to do so will outsource their conferencing services or choose the company as their provider in case they do outsource conferencing 
the company also believes that many of its current and prospective customers have sufficient resources to purchase the equipment and hire the personnel necessary to establish and maintain conferencing capabilities sufficient to meet their own respective conferencing needs 
if the manufacturers of pbxs develop improved  cost effective pbx capabilities for handling conferences with the quality of existing bridges used in the conferencing business  the company s customers could choose to purchase such equipment and hire the personnel necessary to service their conferencing needs through internal telephone systems 
the loss of such customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
additionally  if internet technology can be modified to accommodate multipoint voice transmission comparable to existing bridges used in the conferencing business  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  sales  marketing  managerial  operational and other resources  as well as greater name recognition  than the company and may be able to respond more effectively than the company to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  such competitors may be capable of initiating or withstanding significant price decreases or devoting substantially greater resources than the company to the development  promotion and sale of new services 
because bridges are not prohibitively expensive to purchase or maintain  companies previously not involved in conferencing could choose to enter the marketplace and compete with the company 
there can be no assurance that new competitors will not enter the company s markets or that consolidations or alliances among current competitors will not create significant new competition 
in order to remain competitive  the company will be required to provide superior customer service and to respond effectively to the introduction of new and improved services offered by its competitors 
any failure of the company to accomplish these tasks or otherwise to respond to competitive threats may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
suppliers the company s services require two material components which it purchases from outside suppliers telecommunications services 
a significant portion of the company s direct costs are attributable to the purchase of local and long distance telephone services 
the operating centers have purchased telecommunications services from a number of vendors  including at t  sprint  mci worldcom  and qwest communications international  inc the company believes that multiple suppliers will continue to compete for the company s telecommunications contracts 
since the minutes of use generated by the company will be substantially higher than the largest of the operating centers  the company s experience is that it has been able to to negotiate telecommunications contracts with lower prices and improved service guarantees 
in light of what the company believes to be increased competition among long distance service providers  the company has been entering into shorter term contracts for long distance services in order to obtain the benefit of anticipated reduced costs over time 
however  there can be no assurance that competition in the long distance services market will continue to increase  that any increased competition will reduce the cost of long distance services or that the company s purchasing strategy will result in cost savings 
if the costs of long distance services increase over time  the company s current purchasing strategy which calls for shorter term contracts may place it at a competitive disadvantage with respect to competitors that have entered into longer term contracts for long distance services 
there can be no assurance that the company s analysis of the future costs of long distance services will be accurate  and the failure to predict future cost trends accurately could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
bridging hardware and software support systems 
the company uses bridge equipment produced by three different manufacturers 
at present  the equipment being utilized is not functionally identical  but is compatible with substantially all network standards 
as of december   approximately of the operating centers port capacity was manufactured by one vendor  multilink  inc  which was acquired by picturetel corporation in however  a number of other vendors offer similar bridging equipment

cost of revenues  excluding depreciation  consists primarily of long distance telephone and network charges  salaries and benefits for conference operators and reservationists and maintenance of telephone bridging equipment 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits to sales and marketing personnel  executive officers and general and administrative employees  marketing expenses  occupancy costs and professional fees 
prior to the acquisitions  the operating centers were managed as independent private companies  and  as such  their results of operations reflect different tax structures s corporations and c corporations which have influenced  among other things  their levels of historical compensation 
certain officers and employees of the operating centers agreed to reductions in their compensation and benefits in connection with the acquisitions 
the difference between the historical compensation and benefits of such individuals and the compensation and benefits they agreed to accept subsequent to the acquisitions is referred to as compensation differential 
this compensation differential and the related income tax effect have been reflected as pro forma adjustments in the company s pro forma combined financial statements included elsewhere herein 
the company  which has only conducted operations since november  other than in connection with certain financing transactions  the issuance of senior notes and the acquisitions  has integrated several of its operations  including sales  marketing  human resources  benefits administration  accounting and finance  excluding billing 
within the next six months  the company plans to complete the migration of the reservations process to one common reservation system

once implemented  the system is expected to reduce costs through enhanced billing efficiencies 
additional cost reduction opportunities exist with the company s long distance costs as a result of new agreements recently entered into by the company 
it is anticipated that increased marketing costs will be required to further establish the company s brand name in the marketplace 
as a result of these various costs and cost savings  comparisons of historical operating results may not be meaningful  and such results may not be indicative of future performance

all such forward looking statements  whether written or oral  and whether made by or on behalf of the company  are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements and any other cautionary statements which may accompany the forward looking statements 
in addition  the company disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
the company s expectations  beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and are believed by the company to have a reasonable basis  including without limitation  management s examination of historical operating trends  data contained in the company s records and other data available from third parties  but there can be no assurance that management s expectations  beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished 
in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein  some of the important factors that  in the view of the company  could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements include the following absence of consolidated operating history 
vialog corporation was founded on january  and has only conducted operations and generated revenues since november   the date the company acquired its original six private conference service bureaus 
prior to that time  the operating centers each operated as separate  independent businesses 
in addition  the company used the purchase method of accounting to record the acquisitions and consequently  the pro forma and consolidated financial information contained in this report may not be indicative of the company s future operating results and financial condition 
substantial leverage and ability to service debt 
the company is highly leveraged  with substantial debt service in addition to operating expenses and planned capital expenditures 
at december   the total indebtedness of the company was approximately million  net of unamortized original issue discount of million 
in october  the company closed a senior credit facility for a principal amount of up to million 
as of december   the company had approximately million of borrowings outstanding under its senior credit facility 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company s level of indebtedness will have several important effects on its future operations  including  without limitation  i a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on its indebtedness  ii covenants contained in the indenture and the senior credit facility require the company to meet certain financial tests  and other restrictions contained in the indenture and the senior credit facility limit its ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of assets  and may affect the company s flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in its business  including possible acquisition activities  iii the company s leveraged position has substantially increased its vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions  and iv the company s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate and other purposes may be limited 
the company s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will be dependent upon the company s future performance  which will be subject to general economic  industry and competitive conditions 
there can be no assurance that the company s business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt  it may be required  among other things  to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  to refinance or restructure all or a portion of its indebtedness  to sell selected assets  or to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that any such measures would be sufficient to enable the company to service its debt  or that any of these measures could be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
restrictions imposed by lenders 
the indenture and the senior credit facility contain a number of covenants that restrict the ability of the company to dispose of assets  merge or consolidate with another entity  incur additional indebtedness  create liens  make capital expenditures or other investments or acquisitions and otherwise restrict corporate activities 
the ability of the company to comply with such provisions may be affected by events that are beyond the company s control 
the breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture or the senior credit facility  which would permit the holders of the senior notes and or the lender under the senior credit facility to declare all amounts borrowed thereunder to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
if the company were unable to repay its indebtedness to the lender under the senior credit facility  such lender could proceed against any and all collateral securing such indebtedness 
in addition  as a result of these covenants  the ability of the company to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to secure additional financing  if needed  may be significantly restricted  and the company may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to the company 
any of such events could adversely impact the market for the company s senior notes and common stock 
see substantial leverage and ability to service debt 
competition 
several of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  sales  marketing  managerial  operational and other resources  as well as greater name recognition  than the company 
as a result  competitors may be able to respond more effectively than the company to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  to initiate or withstand significant price decreases or to devote substantially greater resources than the company in order to develop and promote new services 
because multipoint control units mcus  the equipment commonly used to provide teleconferencing services  are not prohibitively expensive to purchase or maintain  companies previously not involved in teleconferencing could choose to enter the marketplace and compete with the company 
there can be no assurance that new competitors will not enter the company s markets or that consolidations or alliances among current competitors will not create significant new competition 
in order to remain competitive  the company will be required to provide superior customer service and to respond effectively to the introduction of new and improved services including internet based services offered by its competitors 
any failure of the company to accomplish these tasks or otherwise to respond to competitive threats could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects and could adversely impact the market for the company s common stock 
the company derived approximately of its pro forma net revenues from ixcs and lecs which outsource teleconferencing services provided to their respective customers 
these telecommunications companies have the financial capability and expertise to deliver such services internally 
there can be no assurance that the company s current ixc and lec customers will not begin to provide the teleconferencing services currently provided by the company and pursue such market actively and in direct competition with the company 
moreover  the company expects to derive a portion of its future revenues from rbocs that enter the long distance market and outsource their teleconferencing services 
there can be no assurance that the rbocs will be able to enter the long distance market on a timely basis  if at all  that any rboc entering the long distance market will offer teleconferencing services  or that any ixc  lec or rboc offering such services will outsource services or choose the company as the provider of such outsourced teleconferencing services 
the failure of any such event to occur could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects and could adversely impact the market for the company s common stock 
teleconferencing insourcing 
many of the company s current and prospective customers have sufficient resources to purchase the equipment and hire the personnel necessary to establish and maintain teleconferencing capabilities sufficient to meet their own respective teleconferencing needs 
moreover  technological improvements will further enhance the ability of these customers to establish internal teleconferencing facilities 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s customers will not establish internal teleconferencing facilities or expand existing facilities  then cease to use the company s services 
the loss of any one or more of such customers could cause a significant and immediate decline in net revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects and could adversely impact the market for the company s common stock 
see business customers and business competition 
recent entry into internet conferencing markets 
only two of the operating centers offered internet conferencing services in  and to date no material revenues have been generated from internet conferencing services 
sales people  reservationists  operators and technical support people are involved in ongoing training programs 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain significant business from internet conferencing services or  if obtained  that the company has the ability to service such business 
see business the company s conferencing services 
technological considerations 
the company currently derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from the sale of audio teleconferencing services 
if the manufacturers of private branch exchanges pbxs  the equipment used by most businesses and institutions to handle their internal telephone requirements  develop improved  cost effective pbx capabilities for handling teleconferencing calls with the quality and functionality of existing mcus used in the teleconferencing business  the company s customers could choose to purchase such equipment and hire the personnel necessary to service their teleconferencing needs through internal telephone systems 
the loss of such customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
additionally  if internet technology can be modified to accommodate multipoint voice transmission with audio quality comparable to that of mcus used in the teleconferencing business  the availability of such technology could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects and could adversely impact the market for the company s common stock 
see business competition 
long distance services contracts 
a significant portion of the company s direct costs are attributable to the purchase of local and long distance telephone services 
it has been management s experience that the costs of long distance services have been decreasing over the past several years 
if  however  the costs of long distance services increase over time  the company s current purchasing strategy  which calls for shorter term contracts  may place it at a competitive disadvantage with respect to competitors that have entered into longer term contracts for long distance services 
there can be no assurance that competition in the long distance services market will continue to increase  that any increased competition will reduce the cost of long distance services or that the company s purchasing strategy will result in cost savings 
in addition  if the company experiences a shortfall in projected volume  it may be required to pay a penalty under one or more of its contracts 
there can be no assurance that the company s analysis of the future costs of long distance services will be accurate  and the failure to predict future cost trends accurately could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects and could adversely impact the market for the company s common stock 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business suppliers 
regulation 
in general  the telecommunications industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and local governments 
although there is little or no direct regulation in the united states of the core conferencing services offered by the company  various government agencies  such as the federal communications commission the fcc  have jurisdiction over some of the company s current and potential suppliers of telecommunications services  and government regulation of those services may have a direct impact on the cost of the company s conferencing services 
there can be no assurance that the fcc or other government agencies will not seek in the future to regulate the company as a common carrier and regulate the prices  conditions or other aspects of the conferencing services offered by the company  that the fcc will not impose registration  certification or other requirements on the provision of those services  or that the company would be able to comply with any such requirements 
additionally  changes in the current federal  state or local legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects and could adversely impact the market for the company s common stock 
moreover  government regulations in countries other than the united states vary widely and may restrict the company s ability to offer its services in those countries 
see business regulation 
change of control 
in the event of certain events causing a change of control of the company as defined in the indenture the company may be required to repurchase all of the outstanding senior notes at of the principal amount  as the case may be  of the senior notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon  and additional interest as defined in the indenture  if any  to the date of repurchase 
the exercise by the holders of the senior notes of their rights to require the company to offer to purchase senior notes upon a change of control could also cause a default under other indebtedness of the company  even if the change of control itself does not  because of the financial effect of such repurchase on the company 
there can be no assurance that in the event of a change of control  the company will have  or will have access to  sufficient funds  or will be contractually permitted under the terms of outstanding indebtedness  to pay the required purchase price for any senior notes 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
potential fluctuation in quarterly results 
quarterly net revenues are difficult to forecast because the market for the company s services is competitive and subject to variation 
in addition  the consolidation of the operating centers may result in unanticipated operational difficulties 
the company s expenses are based  in part  on its expectations as to future net revenues 
if net revenues are below expectations  the company may be unable or unwilling to reduce expenses  and the failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance and could adversely impact the market for the company s common stock

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk primarily from interest rates on its million credit facility with coast business credit  a division of southern pacific bank 
the credit facility provides for i a term loan in the principal amount of million  ii a term loan of up to of the purchase price of new and used equipment  not to exceed million  and iii a revolving loan based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable 
loans under the credit facility bear interest at the higher of or the prime rate plus  and interest is based on a minimum outstanding principal balance of the greater of million or of the available credit facility 
the sensitivity analysis below  which hypothetically illustrates our potential market risk exposure  estimates the effects of hypothetical sudden and sustained changes in the applicable market conditions on earnings 
the sensitivity analysis presented does not consider any additional actions the company may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
the market changes  assumed to occur as of december   include a basis point and a basis point change in market interest rates 
the hypothetical changes and assumptions may be different from what actually occurs in the future 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
as such  the company is exposed to earnings and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to its revolving line of credit and its long term obligations 
as of december   approximately of the company s credit facility and long term obligations were floating rate obligations 
the deterimental effect on the company s earnings of the hypothetical basis point and basis point increase in interest rates described above would be approximately  and  respectively  before income taxes 
the company does not have any other material market risk exposure
