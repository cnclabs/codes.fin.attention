item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of some factors including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of integrated consulting and software solutions that enable banks to maximize their electronic finance e finance opportunities  increase their revenues  reduce their costs and enhance their delivery of customer services 
we were founded in to provide consulting services to banks  and subsequently integrated software products into our banking solutions 
with our acquisition of antinori software  inc in  we were able to significantly enhance our portfolio of software products 
additionally  we acquired genisys operations  inc genisys in january  which provided incremental added value to our product offerings 
the acquisitions of asi and genisys were each accounted for as a pooling of interests and accordingly  our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  as well as all other financial and statistical data presented in this report  have been restated to include the financial position and results of operations for asi and genisys for all periods prior to and including the period ended january  we derive our revenue from consulting and management service fees  software license fees  software maintenance fees  software implementation fees and hardware and other sales 
while many customer contracts provide for both the performance of consulting services and the license of related software  some customer contracts require only the performance of consulting services or only a software license and  at the election of the customer  related implementation services and or annual software maintenance services 
we enter into these contracts with our customers on a project by project basis 
a substantial majority of our revenues are generated from contracts with banks with assets over billion tier i banks and banks with assets of between billion and billion tier ii banks 
we seek to establish long term relationships with our customers that will lead to on going projects utilizing our solutions 
we are typically retained to perform one or more discrete projects for a customer  and use these opportunities to extend our solutions into additional areas of the customer s operations 
to this end  approximately and of our total revenues during the year ended january  were derived from companies who were customers of ours during the years ended january  and  respectively

consulting and management service fees 
we employ three primary pricing methods in connection with our delivery of consulting and management services 
first  we may price our delivery of consulting and management services on the basis of time and materials  in which case the customer is charged agreed daily rates for services performed and out of pocket expenses 
in this case  fees and related amounts are generally payable on a monthly basis  and revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
second  consulting and management services may be delivered on a fixed price basis 
in this case  payments are made to us on a monthly basis or pursuant to an agreed upon payment schedule  and revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
any anticipated losses on a fixed price contract are recognized when estimable 
third  we may deliver consulting and management services pursuant to a value pricing contract with the customer 
in this case  we are paid  on an agreed upon basis with the customer  either a specified percentage of i the projected increased revenues or decreased costs that are expected to be derived by the customer over a period of up to twelve months following implementation of our solution or ii the actual increased revenues and or decreased costs experienced by the customer over a period of up to twelve months following implementation of our solution  subject in either case to a ceiling  if any is agreed to  on the total amount of payments to be made to us 
these contracts typically provide for us to receive from to of the projected or actual increased revenues or decreased costs  with payments to be made to us pursuant to an agreed upon schedule ranging from one to twelve months in length 
revenues generated from rendering consulting and management services in connection with value priced contracts based upon projected results are recognized only upon completion of all services and agreement upon the actual fee to be paid even though billings for these services may be delayed by mutual agreement for periods not to exceed twelve months 
when fees are to be paid based on a percentage of actual revenues or savings  we recognize revenue only upon completion of all services and as the amounts of actual revenues or savings are confirmed by the customer 
we typically must first commit time and resources to develop projections associated with value pricing contracts before a bank will commit to purchase our solutions  and therefore assume the risk of making these commitments with no assurance that the bank will purchase the solutions 
we expect that value pricing contracts will account for an increasing percentage of our revenues in the future 
in addition  as a consequence of the shift toward the use of more value pricing contracts and due to the revenue recognition policy associated with those contracts  our results of operations will likely fluctuate significantly from period to period regardless of the pricing method employed by us in a given contract  we are reimbursed on a monthly basis for out of pocket expenses incurred on behalf of our customers  which expenses are netted against reimbursements for financial statement reporting purposes 
see selected quarterly results of operations 
software license fees 
in the event that a software license is sold together with consulting and management services or on a stand alone basis  software license fees are payable to us in one or more installments  as provided in the customer s contract 
software license revenues for periods subsequent to january   are recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
under sop  software license revenues are recognized upon execution of a contract and delivery of software  provided that the license fee is fixed and determinable  no significant production  modification or customization of the software is required  and collection is considered probable by management 
for periods prior to january   software license revenues were recognized in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition 
under sop  software license revenues were recognized upon execution of a contract and shipment of the software and after any customer cancellation right had expired  provided that no significant vendor obligations remained outstanding  amounts were due within one year  and collection was considered probable by management 
software licenses continue for an indefinite period and there is no provision for any renewal fees 
we also enter into value pricing contracts in connection with our grant of software licenses  in which case payments are made and revenue is recognized in a similar fashion for these contracts in the consulting and management services context 
although substantially all of our current software licenses provide for a set license fee  whether pursuant to a fixed price or value pricing contract  some of our payment electronification licenses instead provide for per transaction license fees in which case fees are recognized and due on a monthly basis 
we expect to increase this practice of charging license fees on a per transaction basis in the future as part of our strategy to increase recurring revenues and smooth our period to period revenues 
see business strategy increase use of value pricing and recurring revenue arrangements 
software maintenance fees 
in connection with our sale of a software license  a customer may elect to purchase software maintenance services 
most of the customers that purchase software licenses from us also purchase software maintenance services  which typically are renewed annually 
we charge an annual maintenance fee  which is typically a percent of the initial software license fee  and generally is payable to us at the beginning of the maintenance period and is recognized ratably over the term of the related contract 
software implementation fees 
in connection with our sale of a software license  a customer may elect to purchase software implementation services  including software enhancements  patches and other software support services 
most of the customers that purchase software licenses from us also purchase software implementation services 
we price our implementation services on a time and materials or on a fixed price basis  and the related revenues are recognized as services are performed 
hardware and other sales 
our computer hardware and supplies sales are made in tandem with the delivery of related services or software  and are sold on the basis of our cost plus a specified percentage 
revenues are recognized upon shipment of the hardware to the customer 
we sell hardware at the request of our customers  but do not consider hardware sales to be a meaningful part of our business 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we capitalize software development costs incurred in developing a product once technological feasibility of the product has been determined 
these capitalized software development costs also include amounts paid for software that is purchased and that has reached technological feasibility 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on the basis of each product s projected revenue or on a straight line basis over the remaining economic life of the product generally three years 
at january   our capitalized software development costs  net of accumulated amortization  were million  which will be amortized over the next quarterly periods

operating cash was generated principally through net income before non cash charges for amortization of capitalized software  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  and through a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
due to negotiated payment terms associated with some sales  accounts receivable increased using million of cash provided by operations 
during fiscal  we used million in operating activities principally due to increases in accounts receivable of million

cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  and was primarily related to purchases of property and equipment of million  and purchases and development of capitalized software of million 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  and was primarily related to purchases of short term investments of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  and development of capitalized software of million 
cash generated through financing activities for fiscal was not significant 
cash generated through financing activities for fiscal of million resulted primarily from proceeds derived from our initial public offering completed on may  for million after deducting costs of the offering  and million including million of related tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options 
we no longer maintain a revolving credit facility in light of our current liquidity position 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors 
we believe that current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least january however  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing within this time frame 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risk and uncertainties  and actual results could vary 
the failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas  as amended  is effective for quarters beginning after june  we do not currently utilize derivative financial instruments 
therefore  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operation or financial position 
the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants has issued statement of position sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  which amends some provisions of statement of position no 
software revenue recognition sop 
sop requires the use of the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements in an arrangement but there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement 
sop is effective for us on february  we do not expect sop to materially impact our future results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which summarizes some of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the effective date of sab for us is the quarter ended july  we continue to evaluate the impact that sab will have on the timing of revenue recognition in future periods 
based on its initial evaluation  we believe sab will not have a material impact on our future results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  primarily tax advantaged variable rate and fixed rate obligations of state and local municipalities  and educational entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
all of the cash equivalents and short term investments are treated as available for sale under sfas investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a raise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changed in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investment securities are held for purposes other than trading 
the weighted average interest rate on investment securities at january  was 
amortized cost of short term investments held at january  was million  which approximates fair value
