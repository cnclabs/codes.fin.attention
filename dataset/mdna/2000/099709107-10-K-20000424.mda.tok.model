the company plans to execute its expansion plans for its borders superstores and other strategic initiatives principally with funds generated from operations and financing through the lease facility in and beyond 
in the event that working capital requirements are in excess of operating cash flows and lease financing  the company may fund such excess with borrowings under the credit facility 
the company believes funds generated from operations  borrowings under the credit facility and financing through the lease facility will be sufficient to fund its anticipated capital requirements for at least the next two to three years 
the company currently has a share repurchase program in place with remaining authorization to repurchase approximately million 
during and  million and million of common stock was repurchased  respectively 
the company has a million multicurrency credit agreement the credit facility which expires in october  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a base rate or an increment over libor at the company s option

during  the company entered into a million multicurrency seasonal revolving credit facility the seasonal facility which expires in july  borrowings under the seasonal facility bear interest at a base rate or an increment over libor at the company s option 
the seasonal facility contains covenants and events of defaults that are similar to those contained in the credit facility described above 
the company had no borrowings outstanding under the seasonal facility as of january  effective february  the company reduced the credit available under the seasonal facility to million  in accordance with provisions of the agreement 
the company has a million lease financing facility the lease facility to finance new stores and other property through operating leases which expires in october  the lease facility provides financing to lessors through loans from a third party lender for up to of a project cost 
it is expected that lessors will make equity contributions approximating of each project 
independent of its obligations as lessee  the company guarantees payment when due of all amounts required to be paid to the third party lender 
the principal amount guaranteed will be limited to approximately of the original cost of a project  so long as the company is not in default under the lease relating to such project 
the lease facility contains covenants and events of default that are similar to those contained in the credit facility described above 
effective february  the company decreased the credit available under the lease facility to million 
there were properties financed through the lease facility  with a financed value of million  at january  management believes that the rental payments for properties financed through the lease facility may be lower than those which the company could obtain elsewhere due to  among other factors  i the lower borrowing rates available to the company s landlords under the facility  and ii the fact that rental payments for properties financed through the facility do not include amortization of the principal amounts of the landlords indebtedness related to the properties 
rental payments relating to such properties will be adjusted when permanent financing is obtained to reflect the interest rates available at the time of the refinancing and the amortization of principal 
in december   properties previously financed through the lease facility with a total financed value of million were permanently financed through operating leases 
during  the company entered into agreements in which leases with respect to four borders locations serve as collateral for certain mortgage pass through certificates 
these mortgage pass through certificates include a provision requiring the company to repurchase the underlying mortgage notes in certain events  including the failure by the company to make payments of rent under the related leases  the failure by kmart corporation the former parent of the company to maintain required investment grade ratings or the termination of the guarantee by kmart corporation of the company s obligations under the related leases which would require mutual consent of kmart and borders 
in the event the company is required to repurchase all of the underlying mortgage notes  the company would be obligated to pay approximately million 
the company would expect to fund this obligation through its line of credit 
since february  kmart corporation has failed to maintain investment grade ratings and  therefore  these notes are now subject to put by the holder 
to date  the holder has not exercised its right to put the notes 
the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  as interest on the company s borrowings is principally based on variable rates 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company primarily utilizes interest rate swaps and collars to achieve this objective  effectively converting a portion of its variable rate exposures to fixed interest rates 
libor is the rate upon which the company s variable rate debt  and its payments under the lease facility  are principally based 
if libor were to increase for the full year in as compared to the end of  the company s after tax earnings  after considering the effects of its interest rate swap and collar agreements  would decrease million based on the company s expected average outstanding debt  including its indirect borrowings under the lease facility  as of january  other matters year issue the company experienced no significant disruption to operations or business systems as a result of the transition from to the company does not expect any material subsequent disruption to its operations or business systems from this transition 
subsequent event subsequent to the company s fiscal year end  the board of directors authorized the company to explore strategic alternatives in order to increase shareholder value 
these alternatives could include a recapitalization  a leveraged buyout  or a business combination with another company  however  there is no assurance that any transaction will occur
