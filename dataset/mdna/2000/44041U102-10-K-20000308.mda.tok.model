as of december   hgp s portfolio consisted of factory outlet centers and one power center located in states comprising an aggregate of approximately million square feet of gross leasable area gla 
ten of the factory outlet centers and the power center were contributed to the company in connection with the consummation of the merger by horizon pursuant to a contribution agreement entered into in connection with the merger the contribution agreement and two factory outlet centers were purchased by the company from prime immediately subsequent to the consummation of the merger 
results of operations the statements for the periods subsequent to june   the date of the company s acquisition of the outlet centers  one power center and horizon s former administrative office from horizon the predecessor properties and the purchase of two properties from prime the prime transferred properties reflect the operation of the company as a separate entity 
the financial statements of the company for the periods subsequent to june  are not directly comparable to the statements of the predecessor properties for periods prior to the merger due to a number of factors  including a significant change in the indebtedness of the company which occurred in conjunction with the merger  the acquisition by the company of two additional outlet centers immediately after the merger  the results of which are not included in the financial statements of the predecessor properties  the fact that the outlet center in algodones  new mexico was substantially occupied during the periods presented prior to but was vacant during the periods subsequent to june  and the carrying value of the predecessor properties for the periods prior to the merger are stated at horizon s historic cost and depreciation expense is based on those costs

the financial statements for the periods prior to the merger reflect the results of operations  financial position  and cash flows of the predecessor properties prior to the merger as if the predecessor properties had been a separate entity which owned such assets for all periods presented 
the historical results of operations and financial condition of the predecessor properties are based on the manner in which horizon historically managed such net assets 
accordingly  the combined financial statements of the predecessor properties have been prepared using horizon s historical basis of the assets and liabilities and historical results of operations related to the predecessor properties 
in this regard  because horizon owned the predecessor properties  together with other properties which were not contributed to the company  the predecessor properties were not insulated from the obligations and commitments of horizon 
certain assumptions relating to the allocation of cash and cash equivalents  debt and financing costs  interest expense and general and administrative expenses  all of which were historically aggregated by horizon  have been made in the combined financial statements for the periods prior to the merger

there can be no assurance that a transaction will result involving the company 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involved the following four phases assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
the company s assessment indicated that its significant information processing technology systems could have been affected  particularly the general ledger and billing systems 
the assessment also indicated that software and hardware used in certain equipment including security  lighting  automatic sprinklers  and heating and ventilating systems at the company s properties could also have been at risk 
the company upgraded its jd edwards based accounting system and the ibm as on which it is run

the following table shows sensitivity of annual interest expense and net income per share diluted based on an increase in the libor of basis points principal amount change in libor rate change in interest expense per share diluted inflation hgp s leases with the majority of its tenants require the tenants to reimburse hgp for most operating expenses and increase in common area main tenant expense  which reduces hgp s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to certain legal actions 
while any litigation contains an element of uncertainty  management believes the losses  if any  resulting from such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the company

the lawsuit requests that the transaction with pch be enjoined  or  in the event that the transaction is consummated  that the transaction be rescinded and that damages be awarded to the purported class members 
on march   the company received a letter from pch withdrawing its proposal for a business combination with hgp
