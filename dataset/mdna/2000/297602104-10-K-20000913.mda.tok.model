item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company s policy has been to utilize united states dollar denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
at june   the company had million of short term debt outstanding and million of total long term debt outstanding 
the company has one debt instrument outstanding with a variable interest rate 
this debt instrument has a principal balance of million  which matures in based on the principal outstanding in  a one percentage point increase in the variable interest rate would not have had a significant impact on the company s interest expense 
currently  the company does not enter into financial instruments transactions for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate exposure
